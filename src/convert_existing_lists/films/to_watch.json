  {"title":"The Tragedy of Macbeth","score":"","date":"","year":"2021","staff":"","comments":"It's an interesting choice: an emphasis on wording with minimal set pieces inspired by play acting and black and white. Tries to appeal to the more raw Shakespeare sensibilities. Cinematography with lighting is excellent.\n\nThis is an intensive movie. As it's real-time, it's very hard to understand the script unless you parse the text carefully or are recently familiar with the scenes beforehand. It's due to a combination of archaic English and poetry. I felt scenes were much more enjoyable to watch after rewatching them as certain lines are too dense. I had to pay a significant amount of attention at each line to make sure I understood its intent."},
