The one-bitness and lack of subtlety in constantly reinforcing \"We're all going to die!\" is a bit tiring. Pacing is also kind of bad at second half, where it drags out and there wasn't much else to see. Some details I don't like: the focus almost exclusively on the American government; and the lack of power from the entire scientific community.",

    "review": "The excellent story and pacing works well, although I find the duplicate scenes in telling multiple perspectives can be dull even if it's done artistically for emphasis. The overarching themes dilly-dallies---first about the evolution of two friends through betrayal. Later, a large portion devoted to romance and woman's rights as property and the victim as the villain. It's effectively two stories in one, and that meandering weakens the film.\n\nGreat acting. Decent setting. Characters can be a little too one-bit at times (e.g., the miserly mother in law, the libertine ruler, the young and excited king).\n\nI find it a little unbelievable that a seasoned knight is fighting so equally with a squire that has little battle experience. Makes for good action I suppose, including the finale where they try to have him confess.",

I wish the horror would abide by its rules instead of having doors open and close by themselves for example, or the suspect appear in and out of frames for the shock, or the ability to dodge a million bullets. The core power here is electricity, not a general sense of mystifying ghostiness. The contortionist body adds well to the creep factor, and I do admire that they show the villain from the beginning instead of obscuring them. The idea behind the reveal is so zany that it's actually pretty creative.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Photo aging technology? Please.\n+ Chase and action fight sequence.

It's about a man reentering an industry and getting drugged to do gruesome acts as he tries to understand what's he getting into. For film in extreme cinema, it's surprisingly high production value and with a compelling plot. It's not complex; it at least displays more depth than other thrillers like Saw and Ichi the Killer.\n\nThe more iconic scenes:\n\n+ A man having sex with a newborn baby. They actually don't really show anything. It's more the idea that's revolting than the visual act.\n+ It's doggy style raping a women then beating her on the back and cutting her head off with a machete. A scene where he gets sodomized by a bodyguard.\n+ The porn actress that got him into this kidnapped, pulled her teeth out, and then forced a blowjob.\n+ Him fucking his overdosed son while his brother has sex with his wife. And then a violent shootout as he takes vengeance followed by other over-the-top acts like him fucking a guy's eye..",

The portrayal of Somali is also quite evil: they should have portrayed them in a more human light.\n\nThis is the kind of movie that promotes the military, pushing more funding and heroics to the guys that further weapons rather than solve the problems that caused this scenario in the first place. It especially hurts that the real Captain Phillips is a scumbag that shouldn't be a hero, both recklessly being too close to the Somali coast in the first place and having taken no role in the heroism as levied by former crew members. It would have been an even more interesting story if instead of portraying a Mary Sue hero, they portrayed a flawed individual just like the Somalian captain---but that's too nuanced for Hollywood.",

Clearly it comes from his Youtube origins.\n\nIt's truly more of a one-man show than a one-man standup in the traditional sense of a mic and stool. And I think that's what makes it so exciting. It pushes the boundary of typical comedy as a meta-performance with good elements in it. Every one of his shows talks a lot about him, and he's very blunt about not just his style but the themes.\n\nNot all the jokes land with me. They're all original at least. And I do like when I like it mixes into social commentary.",

The transition from the low point to the climax explains nothing how they suddenly win all their fights.\n\nCast-wise, Kano is basically a jackass version of Johnny Cage in this movie, with the quips, fourth walling, and sexual tension. And Cole is playing as a young Liu Kang but with Hasashi and American origins. Cole's power is shitty though: it's literal version of plot armor. Accounting for this, I think the cast composition is okay as it gives slightly different backgrounds and personalities to what we would otherwise expect. I also like the appearance of less-core Mortal Kombat heroes like Kung Lao, Nitara, Reiko, and Kabal.\n\nAll the iconic game references. Like the leg sweep spam. Kung Lao's fatality.\n\nSemi-hilarious that Jax gets the worst power: slightly better tech. The individual fight setups.\n\nI miss the amazing music from the 1995 film. The electronic music really defines the series. The special effects are also kind of budget and feel fairly fake at times.",

    "review": "I could never \"get\" Peter Sellers' comedy. He blends high satire (which I enjoy) with slapstick (which I find too forceful). Compare to, e.g., Steve Martin or Rowan Atkinson. It feels very obvious that the film is written as more serious in tone, but Sellers just tries to adlib his style of comedy to not so great merit.\n\nThe film has so much seduction and weird polygamy. Not only do they portray Sellers' character as a lovable buffoon but also a cuckold.\n\nInterestingly, the film is less about Jacques Clouseau and more about the Phantom Charles Lytton. It plays like an awkward James Bond film.\n\nThe pacing is terrible. It just bumbles on without any reason, with scenes made to be comedic that are the longest but without actually advancing the plot.",

I think \"experimental\" fits the movie well with its weird cuts, angles, and blurring with animation.

    "review": "Minari is a perfect blending of family life, culture clash, character development (particularly in its depiction of family, across all characters), and some comedy. Several characters stand out in particular: the dad's ambition in wanting some success in his life which at the worst of times may transcend even family, the wife ever so worrying (for good reason) about their funds, the boy growing up in a mix of cultures and growing from bitterness to loving of his grandma, the grandma.\n\nSome scenes I find particularly memorable: the beating stick, finding a spot for minari, the fire climax.\n\nI like the just-a-tad of racism that isn't violent, but makes an impact that you're not one of them. It's not about racism, it's just a minor element.\n\nI like its anti-ending. It really feels like a continuation of their lives and we just took a snapshot of it.",

    "review": "Daniel Day-Lewis is stellar. The movie has a good blockbuster style plot, pacing, and cinematography as you'd expect from a Spielberg film. Knowing nothing of Lincoln, I'm surprised the film treats him so much like an old geezer, adding unrelated musings and stories to all his answers as if an old sage. I wonder how much of that is actually true. He's bestowed another level compared to the more human characters around him. He does make several grave more human compromises, e.g., impeachable offenses, bordering too much on federal power with patronage appointments.\n\nI also found it pretty surprising how many A-list supporting actors are in the movie. They all do pretty well too.\n\nI find it ironic that the film portrays Thaddeus Stevens on one side as the idealist and Abraham Licoln on another side as the pragmatist. In modern society, we would greatly have preferred Thaddeus Stevens' approach, enabling, e.g., significantly more economic growth opportunities for the freed slaves by redistributing slave owner land to them over the traitors. Jim Crow wouldn't have happened. That said, by giving Thaddeus Stevens such an excellent actor as Tommy Lee Jones, it's great to see that he shines so much in the movie. Another gripe I have is that they elevate Licoln by stating that the people love him. But public pools doesn't determine how good a president is: everyone at that time is racist after all. It's easy to appeal to the current public than it is to appeal to the future, better one.\n\nGreat to see all the compromises to get the 13th Amendment taken. Legal equality between white and black races, not social or political equality. Lincoln even has quotes that \"while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race\".",

Story-wise, the lead makes some stupid decisions. Like running away followed by trying to notify local authorities (additional people you can't trust), or the second time when he realizes his cast was fake all along and going further to try to uncover the truth instead of running away again. The story drags around and just lacks in really going anywhere. The end reveal suffers from so many plot holes: why the lead doctor somehow has survived not only the villager persecution but lasted for 200 years; how the patients get brainwashed by getting eels shoved down their throat; why the staff was masturbating when they're all supposedly in on it.\n\nMia Goth is hot with her iconic face structure and lack of eyebrows..

There's no calling of police. Even the husband acts strangely. The female lead is too soft-spoken to just ask strangers to get the hell out of their house.\n\nThis film is a natural course of pretentiousness without substance. It's artistry gone too far off the rails.",

    "review": "Surprisingly eerie for such a simple horror premise of something always following you. It also uses typical coming of age romance tropes as a foundation. Story-wise, I wish it were more based on no one believing you, which adds to the fear. Here, the friends just up-and-willy spend their whole days helping the girl run away.\n\nAs a side note, it's hilarious to imagine the film as a giant kiting fest: you have sex to tag the next person, and now they have to kite the NPC for the rest of their life until they pass it on. It's also great watching in the background to see if you can spot the person.",

    "review": "Ultimately I think Salo is a bit overrated. It serves its job well, particularly as one of the founders of extreme cinema. And unlike other notorious shock horror films, Salo uses the shock horror to tell a visceral message. But I think the shock horror is done more interestingly in other films where there's more identifiable characters and story progression to make the shock more visceral.\n\nThe structure in the arcs, the storyteller, and various forms of employment, are interesting. More disgusting in its shock horror but not as bad as other films. The worse parts for me are: eating bread with nails; eating shit; pissing on people; the offscene torture scenes to kill them while being raped and after it all. It's actually not that gorey. I wish it had closer to horror elements. They do cover quite a lot of fetishes though. The blistering ending sends a dark message. You can tell that Salo is a surrealist satire that tries its best to portray the magnitude in which fascists in the 1919-1946 defiled, murdered, and raped their population.\n\nThere isn't really any interesting character. The four fascists are all quite similar, and similarly the victims, which I found made it rather unremarkable.\n\nThe editing is weird sometimes. There are a lot of audio voice-overs that take you out of the film as you see no mouths moving.",

Nolan's bad flaws are amplified here: poorly mixed sound with music blocking out hearing the dialogue, poor characters and overuse of military/war moments.  It's like this movie was designed from the set pieces first: dazzling action sequences in a variety of places. Then a discombobulating script weaving them together.\n\nThe Hollywood pseduoscience of reverse entropy is cringey but serviceable. The worst part is the overall narrative, preceding in the first half as a set of fetch quests that don't amount to anything. Dialogue is boring, like it's back-to-back witty dialogue. The dialogue is cryptically stupid with vague one-liners or otherwise exposition.\n\nVisually, the film is great.\n\nThe whole plot thread with the women chained to her husband by a blackmail for jail is hamfisted. It makes little sense for an arms dealer who in another scene talks about having someone try to pull their balls out of their throat before they die, and then in this scene, the most gruesome thing the wife is afraid of is jail time for fraud.",

However, it too often uses horror jumpscares as a crutch, as a simple tease to the audience even if inconsequential. It's weird that the game is effectively a histakes autopsy where they search for the cause of death. Then the climactic scenes of the film becomes too cheap as a fast-paced survival horror.",

The connections between his days of being stared at in a circus vs stared at in London society are not unexpected. I also like the more abstract parts of The Elephant Man, such as with the elephant scenes or with the drunken folk barging into his room at night to harrass him. Plot-wise, I don't get why they don't just involve the police: he's literally been kidnapped. John speaks volumes by merely existing with his experiences. Lynch really sells how well he can tell a subdued story, primarily enhanced by its audiovisuals.",

The audience is now more interested in understanding more what will happen in details, and not a binary question of whether things are real. The dream sequences are terrifying. The divided Berlin setting is excellent with uprisings along with its cultural mix of English, German, and French. The dancing sequences do body horror real well. Also its sexual behavior, particularly with grasping, panting, straps, and nipples showing through shirts.\n\nOh my god. The climax is like Japanese horror movie crazy. Not the absurdity of pianos eating people, but at that extreme of its subgenre of horror.\n\nI watched this back in late 2019 but never got around to finishing it until now. It could just be me getting into it agian, and partially why I never got around to finishing it in the first go, but I agree that the story meanders quite a bit. It doesn't 2.5 hours.",

But it also has a great story, from initial premise to characters and the story behind the horors they see. Main cast is outstanding. The core story really solidifes the horror. The horror-building is a little obvious sometimes with its various suspense-building and jumpscare elements: doors opening, dolls, dark holes. I especially like that it takes from African horror. It certainly has some Jordan Peeley vibes with Us in the outsider's perspective to a foreign land; it's not as big a part as the refugee premise.\n",

I like the various mystery with the plot paced well with the dinner scenes as the pinnacle. And with all the various hints about time progressing not as one would expect. The various repeating things that are not traditionally horrifying: dog shaking to get rid of his wet fur; shouting up from the stairs where people are hidden. Then the progressing sense of merged identity with first a childhood photo, then later her paintings and constant change in his parents. The car driving scene in the middle of the film was boring. The continued then meandering and unravelling was also just boring to me. I felt like the idea of relishing a fantasy and constantly revising it is an interesting one for a thriller. It was not executed well though.",

Clearly made for youths with the high school romance plot. But I still found it engaging. Jake Gyllenhaal is what really sealed the deal to watch this. He's amazing in his all films, and it shows even for a blockbuster like this with both his charisma as a hero and later as a villlain. The scenery changes are also nice: love the non-typical locations with Netherlands in particular. It ain't just New York all over again. On a technology side, it's pretty interesting to see a script written based on prospectives of the future of drone technology; but the security on those glasses is plot-like terrible. It's an example of modern scifi to that extent. Illusion CGI is obvious. Truly flexes their creative arm like Through the Spiderverse.",

Comedy and horror mixes well here, and in in Robert Eggers' own style with juvenile farting sailor humor unlike Korean horrors.\n\nSpecific memories: William Dafoe deeply affended that Robert Pattinson didn't like his lobster. LOL. That whole scene mixes horror and comedy. The whipping around the sea gull against the rock.\n\nDamn I love the imagery. The mythic painting poses. The slimes. The sex mermaid scene.\n\nDirected by the person whos debut was The Witch (2015)? Definitely want to see this! Pacing is slow, but ultimately watched when Sodapoppin started a watch party.",

The meta of it based on a rabid fan of the first film reminds me of found footage. Snipping tendons digging into the knee to get them. The forcefeeding funnel. Barbed wire rape. Centipede in asshole. Goes away from your typical horror thriller and straight to exploitation.",

    "review": "The characters are all pretty good, particularly De Niro and Val Kilmer. I like how it digs a bit into each character, going beyond the heist genre to dig more in-depth at their drama. The story's pacing is okay, but too many events seem to happen making the story too busy: a first heist that leads to a betrayal by a corporate guy that wants them back; then the police are onto them which they discover on a second heist; and then they still want to go with a third heist. Simultaneously, the guy who fucked up the first heist is head-bashing black prostitutes. Then the detective Hanna's daughter slits her wrists.\n\nAll the actors are stellar. But I don't like Al Pacino in this. He singlehandedly defines the police squadron. And his theatrics are so overblown. He's so overly cool and macho. And I found the final scene just dumb.\n\nWow the gun sound effects in the climax. So loud, so real.\n\nWhat an all-star cast. This is surprisingly more drama than mystery/heist. It's clear it's a classic for how trope-y action it is, and likely how much it influenced other action heist films.\n\nMotivated because it's a thriller.",

Pacing is awful.\n\nThe plot stupidity that painters and painter critics can somehow understand and evaluate so many different art forms: casket colors included.\n\nOne thing I do like is its mix of comedy and horror. It's like something you'd only see in a Korean film. Here, it's more American in style by showing comedy satirically followed by the horror.\n\nSeveral jumpscares thata re completely unnecessary. And Jake Gyllenhaal is still great, but can't save the script.\n\nNatalie Dyer is adorable here.\n\nThe cinematography is so mediocre. It feels like I'm watching a generic TV episode.\n\nMotivated to watch because: Horror. And Dan Gilroy, who debuted with Nighrcrawler. And Jake Gyllenhaal. Yes fucking please.",

And that it's all explained by imagery and action, not with exposition. The idea of starting from the decline of Mayan society is great: and the depictions of disease, dry crops, and range of society (slaves to poor to royalty). The waterfall scene. The slow-mo scenes.\n\nIt clearly has Western influence, particularly in its cinematography and way the story is told.\n\nThe pregnant woman and child stuck in the well seemed like unnecessary maiden to save bullshit. Or the eating tapir balls.\n\nDamn. They got some running endurance.\n\nI'm surprised by the mixed to negative reception of the film, and lack of awards. It's clearly influenced by Mel Gibson himself being such a character. But the artistry in the film is great.",

And the single shot corridor dirty fight sequence. And the tooth scene. Holy fuck. This is torture more than action.\n\nI had seen clips of the movie close to 5 years ago from now watching this movie to completion. I had also read the manga.

    "review": "The first person action sequence right at the beginning is awesome. Too much shaky cam. But otherwise I'm gushing at the integration of realism and video gaming. It seems like a very real future for video games with the amount of extra detail in player control, enemy movesets, environment interaction, and VR immersion. It'd be so realistic that murder in video games would feel almost repulsive.\n\nI really like the way the story unravels in the beginning half hour.\n\nAlso it features Shin Ha Kyun who's an actor I really adore.\n\nThe romance parts of the story are tedious. This film has too many genre elements. The plastic surgey bit swapping actresses is also weird: I prefer the original action-oriented one than the melodramatic one. It unravels too much into drama rather than action. And the plot is so intermixed at the end it's so confusing. What a shame.\n\nAnd the end fight starts as a cover shooter! Man, fuck cover shooters. They're so boring in their mechanics. The first fight was way better.",

I saw a clip of Se7en on Youtube. Seeing Sion Sono's take to the subgenre ought to be interesting.",

It adds to the sinisterness of it all. The rat scenes make me squeamish. God that's so gross. The scene where he's reaching in the closet, it bites him, and then he stomps on it is gut wrenching.",

    "review": "\"If Superman is so powerful, why can't he stop genocides and wars ? Why can't he stop terrorism? Why can't he make the world a better place ? In this comic, Superman does exactly that. He essentially uses his powers to solve all of the worlds problems. But this isn't a fundamentally good thing.\" https://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/astjsq/superman_red_son_effectively_addresses_almost/. That premise sets the stage very well.\n\nI like the depth into politics of social inequality, feminism, sexuality. I like how Lex's manipulation of Superman plays into this. A lot of the morals plays out like a choice of two lesser evils like the Witcher. \"Poverty, disease, and ignorance have been virtually eliminated in the Warsaw Pact states.\" Batman as a vengeful terrorist. Superman re-living the roles and naivety ultimately becoming Stalin. Different heroes and supervillains taking different stances in the Cold War duality.",

The style shots of dialogue when introduced to a new character of how they die is so cool.\n\nThe watermelon scene is hilarious.\n\nWhat a great epic with pacing that never feels old. I love all the indirect communication, and where Frank is the middleman. It feels so authentic and yet so comedic. THat whole scene from Hoffa's eventual demise to Frank flying the plane, Russ taking his sunglasses, he goes and kills him, and then flies back, all with silence.\n\nJoe Pesci, Robert De Niro, and Al Pacino are all excellent. I especially love how opposite the role Joe Pesci typically plays.",

The folkish lore is introduced well. All the foreshadowing: the love story with the spell and pubes in food; the bear and then later on the wall a scribing of a bear on fire. I especially like how each character gets assimilated with the folks and how you can start to imagine all their downfalls. I'm honestly more fascinated by the lore than I am horrified. Climax and ending was sort of whatever. But bravo for keeping me so invested in a 3 hour film that I diddn't even realize it was 2.5 hours!\n\nThe animalistic grief scenes are done so well. The depictions of drugs by having inanimate objects weave back and forth as if alive. And that one scene where she's crying in the sleeping house and all the maids around her wail in sync. Or the unsettling sex scene: the girl singing into Christian's hand, the old naked lady pumping Christian's butt inside.\n\nChristian steeling Josh's thesis. That sealed the deal for me on my judgment of him lol.\n\n\"Ari Aster really has a thing for close-up shots of mutilated heads. And for deformed children. And people burning alive.\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/c7y18a/official_discussion_midsommar_spoilers/?sort=top. Yes. Those are a few of the symbols..",

I don't think I've ever seen comedy so well intermixed with the mystery. Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas particularly stand out. I love how the story almost evolves Death Note-style with the nurse following Daniel Craig's character. Completely did not expect Marta to stand out so much, and for the story to take such a feel-good approach. Daniel Craig plays such a goofy Sherlock Holmes, but clearly knew it all: He stated from the beginning we would work the case as a passive observer, following a Gravity's Rainbow analogy. And further illustrated with his conversation with Nana. And he was right all along in it ultimately arriving to the truth.\n\nLove the story quirks of an early reveal to play a reverse Clue of whodunnit, and Marta's quirk of vomiting for any lie.\n\nSome amazing shots.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Comedic jabs at political personas: the SJW, the Nazi child masturbating joylessly in the bathroom to pictures of dead deer, the Trump anti-Mexican, the faux upper class liberal.\n+ All the underlevel insults to Marta: calling her by random nationalities, praising the virtues of immigrants while handing Marta a dirty plate as if a nurse is the same as a housekeeper, how they all wanted her at the funeral but were outvoted.\n+ Marta being good at Go by not playing the same and simply making \"beautiful patterns\".\n+ The donut analogy and the ingenious word play: a donut hole in a donut's hole; the donut hole has a hole in its center; donut hole, hole in the donut, whole donut.\n\"I read a tweet about a New Yorker article about you.\"\n+ The passing around of the baseball when the husband throws out the window until by the end of the film, his wife throws it at him so he has a black eye.",

The narrative takes are all great: weird 5 minute flashbacks, narration later in the film for no reason. You just know something is going to happen Pulp Fiction-style, and that fourth walling foreshadowing is so strange yet endearing.\n\nI love the tense scenes. Ending was more anticlimactic than I thought given the brutality of the actual murders. I feel like Quentin Tarantino did that on purpose.. The visit to see George Spahn at the ranch.\n\nBrad Pitt and Leonardo di Caprio are both excellent in this.",

The glasses arsenal scene next in the antique store (possibly the best fight in the film). The hotel fight was also great; John Wick killing the enemies felt like fighting OP mobs. Love the variety of fights from combats to weapons. And the comedy.\n\nI don't know about Halle Berry in the action scenes. She's rather clunky. The fight scene in Morocco was not good.\n\nHoly shit. The Raid stars??\n\n\"In the first two movies you hear about him killing people with a pencil, then they go ahead and show you it in action. In this one they are like, \"ok how can we top that\", then they kick things off with him killing someone with a book. 10/10 film\" Yes! https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/bp20f1/official_discussion_john_wick_chapter_3_parabellum/?sort=top",

His stage persona when on the Murray Franklin show.\n\nPlot itself is decent in the first half but not really that great. The riot scenes seem implausible. It stalls in pacing most of all but I actually like it. I do like the character study in general. The specific setup of his laugh being an affliction, and commonly when he's unhappy/crying.",

    "review": "Overall, a film with flawed writing wandering all over the place in plot but excellent atmosphere, direction, and core premise.\n\nThe man plays a depraved addict on recovery while in search of his lost sister really well. What an actor is Dan Stevens---clearly not an outlier that he does so well in Legion. The characters in the story feel a little too prototypical. But the story remains fun with the mystery of the island and teh creeping horrors. The lighting. The music They make the good characters seem overly good to appeal to the audience for example; e.g., Andrea who serves as a potential love interest is also sympathetic to the kidnapee and acts somewhat against the cult ideals.. A few too many tropes though. Like an abusive evil guy. And two people who supposedly died from an attack but wake up later in scenes. Corny B-rated death scene with the main vaillain and the goodbye scene.\n\nMost major plot hole: the creature feeding the goddess was never explained even if everything else was so told out explicitly. And if it were a guardian, it apparently was never around when the three prisoners first arrived.",

    "review": "Fascinating in-depth tale of the inner workings of an obsessive compulsive---if not overly tropy---serial killer. I like how the film desensitized us to the deaths, and I find it funny how I found the animal cruelty shots far more wincing than I was of watching humans. Maybe it's because media dramatizes humans death so much already. It felt interesting just how it made murder almost routine, and which especially seemed reasonable given the other circumstances in the world such as deaths in hen houses, factories, the trophy parades, taxidermy. His approaches to humans via common practices of other animals raises public concern that I find useful. The surrealism in the ending is great, but I feel like it dabbles almost too much in philosophy that it detracts from the character and story. It's almost as if Lars von Trier simply uses the storytelling to provide a very explicit detailing of his philosophy.\n\nAs usual, psychopaths are interesting because they raise the usual questions: purposes of emotions and empathy; social cues. Decomposition of life. It seems unusually hipster though: clearly pulling from Lars von Trier's passions without an inkling of an explanation to why the serial killer just happense to like what a typical film director would: Glenn Gould, photography, art as the pinnacle of life, desert wine.\n\nThe transitions with the signs are great. So is Glenn Gould. And the narrator.\n\nI love the lamppost illustration.",

The surrealism then of her disappearance and the obvious analogy to the mystery man's predilection to burn down greenhouses. The passive and very Japanese protagonist. Obssessed with even pathetic masturbating scenes. A touching anecdote that apparently never happened. Cats. End of the movie: i don't get it.. Is there a reason things happened---some underlying message---or is just for fun?\n\n> [t]he degree to which Burning succeeds will depend largely on one's capacity to identify with the unspoken but strongly conveyed sense of jealousy and frustration its lower-class protagonist feels\n\nI feel this. This is something that didn't really happen in Barn Burning and feels distinctively Korean. I loved the layering: from a love triangle to the layer of social criticism against class differences to the struggles around Jongsu as a person with his troubled family and lackadaisical nature (e.g., the calf, his father's problems). I especially loved the burning motif across the film: the sun reflecting light toward Haemi's apartment, Jongsu and his father's rage, the physical burning of greenhouses and the car.",

    "review": "Overly Hollywood and American patriotic. I liked the overall depth but it still feels a little too clean. It makes a lot of trope-y scenes more dramatic than they ought to be, and which therefore removes the tension from the crises that are actually dramatic. For example, phone calls from Bryan Cranston's character to each the president of the united states to get the go-ahead, and this happens simultaneously as the 6 hostages and Ben Affleck's character rush to the hospital. Please. And once this happens, this scene transitions to the terrorists and a kid who just happens to finish revealing one of the escapee pictures. And then the plane tailing scene... It's not even historically accurate. Textbook amount of plot. I only liked it for its high production and decent by-the-book acting. Everything is naturally concluded, from all the minor scuff dialogues to the separated family to the office politics.

But the film is unique enough in not being so overly formulaic like Marvel and DC films that it's very fun. It's especially amazing how the powers begin to grow and are rooted from classics (not in style/culture but in the basic tropes). James McAvoy is incredible as always in playing two-bit characters but doing so in such a brilliant way. I love how all the heroes are each paired with a side character. Not sure how I feel about the ending though. I like that it was ambitious in killing them all. But the plausibility of the reveal to the world seems dubious since it's video.",

    "review": "Now this is what a superhero film is like at the hands of creative freedom. I love the dark realism in its depiction of superheroness. Some parts do feel implausible plot-wise to make one skeptical of it all however, pulling one out of the immersion. For example, they realized that the protagonist could lift basically any weight, even up to 700 lb when he had never even done 500 lb before. Clearly they can test more in that angle in terms of limits without going so extreme as to test whether he can die from a gunshot.. That said, I love how it flounders in the audience really knowing for sure.\n\nThe canonical storyline. But its dark execution with both the hero and the villain. It strives not only in its pacing but in its deep dives into the two characters.",

I think it's also that literally everyone acts unemotional, as if it's the world the film is in more so than the characters themselves and their background. The character motivations just feel too irrational that I'm more irked by them that I couldn't appreciate the unraveling of the mystery. With real characters, I would point to for example Steven's inability to connect emotionally with his family or tell them secrets. But literally every character in this world acts that way. As another realm of plausibility, it's easy for doctors to tell if a patient is consciously faking it. They would be able to make _some_ progress, not zero.",

    "review": "Love the 90s fashion, cultural family values, and what they find sexually appealing. I think it's a riot. It really adds perspective to how circumstantial a lot of what we value today in 2019 is. I love how different the three sisters are each of which challenge traditional Chinese culture: the oldest Jia-Jen is being mature and pious as a high-school teacher, mending a broken heart; the middle child Jia-Chien is career motivated and independent; and the youngest child Jia-Ning is in college just sorting out romance and with a part-time job. Mr. Chu is a widower who pampers a family friend woman's daughter. The Sunday dinner table is just ripe for interpretation as it evolves from the traditional setting to topics the parents can no longer provide assistance with. There's so much depth to each character. Mrs. Liang acts like a lot of my aunts and uncles. She's brutal in her lectures about husbandry, age, not knowing family member names, etc. Jesus.\n\nThe way the first two daughters leave the family. LOL. I'm so surprised it's the middle one that ends up being the most developed and relatable. Then the reveal with Mr. Chu and Jin-Rong. Then Jia-Jen's husband is baptized. Mr. Chu truly breaks family traditions, fooling us to think of the grandfatherly relationship to Shah-Shah.",

I can't believe it's genuine for a second. For some of these people, the circumstances are literally life and death due to their family.

It saunters in the music, and just alludes to the troubles of the genius, racism, and homosexuality. Love how they bond over KFC. I didn't expect Vigo Mortenssen to play a comedian so much given his hardass character. This is a wholesome film. A little idealistic without nuance on the racism, cops, and the ending; and with the character-switch from the hard racist I expected in the beginning to a surprisingly very easy-to-convince Italian.

I also like the additional dimension that Willoughby is the most caring and thought-out of the cops, and is additionally dying. Even Willoughby's suicide was heartwarming. And goddamn that ending..

I thought the bear scene was a little sleepy---I'm confident I've seen that idea before (can't pinpoint from where), and it was a little silly that it had to wait for a reaction in order to kill.. Also typical in some horror tropes. I think it would have been better if it didn't end with conclusions about aliens and the refaction unifying everything Evangelion-style; would be better more ambiguous.",

The fashion is amazing. He's such a down-to-earth loveable person that you can't help celebrate his rise. The relationship with the wife is just solid---love their dynamic. Oh my god Bae Doona too. I wish it stayed wholesome though; it gets weirdly Hollywood dark in the second half. I wish it didn't cut the ensemble that makes a Korean film Koreanly wholesome: the wife, the dumb cousin Doo Hwan. As much as I like Bae Doona, her character marks a turning point. There's an obvious shot of Doo Hwan's first shot of the drug. An overly dramatic first murder scene (something I wouldn't expect in a Korean film not produced by Netflix).",

Love the humored failures under the pressure. Certainly the most down-to-earth of the Spiderman films. Love the alternate universe and variants of heros and villains. It gives so much more creative freedom. The mix with more Brooklyn/Queens and the hip-hop. Meta jokes. Epilogue's such a nice touchback on previous animation attempts.\n\nThe latino protagonist and white female feels like pushing an agenda.. It just makes me uncomfortable. Gwen Stacey should also be significantly older than the high school kid. nit: Why does Peter Parker's face look like a blonde gym bozo? It pushes weird expectations on today's society.. I don't think the angst portion of the film is necessary. It just slows down what makes the rest of the film so fun.",

    "review": "Lots of great comedy scenes. This was surprisingly even better than Deadpool---possibly my favorite recent Marvel super hero film in the franchise; it really stands out in its strengths and takes advantage of its AAA status. X-Men cameo. Ryan Reynolds clearly defines Deadpool. Love their audacity of keeping Deadpool's mask off for much of it; they're not afraid to show his hideousness and make fun of it. Dubstep. Deadpool failing to block an array of bullets with his dual swords. X-force deaths. Massive amount of pointless destruction. The moment Deadpool and Cable says holy shit when the big guy Juggernaut attacks them. Juggernaut ripping Deadpool in half. Domino's luck. Deadpool with baby legs. Cable actually teaming up with Deadpool. Linkedin and diversity jokes. Typical fourth wall jokes. Wilhelm Scream. Love the jokes at the contrived writing, e.g., Cable only able to time travel twice, and the lucky 7 too get the prison neckchain off. The credits ending. Killing X-men Origins Deadpool and Ryan Reynolds as Green Lantern. Even the famous cameos were done well such as Brad Pitt showing up and immediately dying.",

    "review": "What a heartbreaking story. I did not expect I would like this movie as much as I did when I started it. What a slow burn. The girl's slow reveals of her abuse just punches you in the heart. Nobody goes to school. Osamu's accident during his construction work is treated lightly but with rather daunting implications about the dangers they live in. The injury isn't \"enough\" for compensation. The ending is just too sad. Contemporary Japan just can't understand their situation. Sakura Ando is a stellar actress. The cast overall is great, but she really has the greatest performances.\n\nAnd yet, beyond the surface-level unfortunatities, they live happier as a family than most you can say in Japan. It's a ragtag bunch bonded by their moments and secrets than filial ones. It's a surreal experience. The only major ties are Osamu and his wife Nobuyo, and her younger sister. They bond through all the little things regardless of their situation.\n\nhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/prize-winning-shoplifters-japans-pm-hates-this-movie-because-its-just-too-true: \"As the film gradually unfolds, you began to understand how these “family” members are all connected and the secrets they keep from each other. It also shows something very rare in Japanese films and in modern Japanese life — an almost happy family. The father comes home for dinner, he talks to his son and daughter. Mom and Dad have mutual affection, they have conversations with each other —and when the kids are away, they even have rambunctious sex. (Some surveys show that 50 percent of married couples in Japan are sexless.)  When the boy reads a book out loud, the family listens.\"\n\nThis post linking Shoplifters in the context of Japan is insightful (https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/a5a96a/explain_shoplifters_to_me_in_a_japanese_context/ebl7jjo/). In particular, it refutes Japan's notion of strong blood ties, simple-minded evil criminals (shoplifying, illegally living off a pension, technically abducting a child, working at a peep shop), and the recession.",

Reminds me of my own places. :-) His outcry at Esther after the scheduling for the gastroscopy is hilarious. Love his reliance on introspection and alcohol. Even his bathroom looks pitiful. Tiny toilet. Small sink and mirror hunched in a corner. The shots of Ethan Hawke warded in a Reverand's clothing and a suicide vest is so interesting. The shots were just so still. I love the lighting in the film overall too. That ending with the song playing as they passionately kiss.. Then the cutout. I just smiled gleefully as it went on at how well-done that is. Story-wise, I can see Toller's descent towards extremism, and an almost peculiar take on environmentalism as a stance for him to continue hating himself.",

It pinpoints the various aggressions caused to black people during a period shortly after Brown vs Board of Education.\"With the right white man, you can do anything.\" Love that line.\n\nThe scenarios are great: John Washington playing a white man on phone calls, Adam Driver playing a black guy playing a white man in person. My only problem is it ends almost too cleanly in its story (even the racist cop is charged). What a great ending though! It's Spike Lee's way of saying that what we just watched may not be so much fiction after all.",

    "review": "Freddie Mercury. What a larger-than-life character. I love him: his flamboyant personality, gaudy fashion, sexuality. The actor does him really really well. The gestures with his stage persona are spot on in particular. As a biopic, it's fairly conservative. The film follows the standard formula of rise, anguish, and contemplation as a character who overcame challenges. The sexuality piece is done naively and with the nervous hands as expected for a blockbuster. The whole Bohemian Rhapsody is played as if they already knew who iconic it would be. That's a little unfortunate that it does touch on more complexities, from other albums that aren't just highlights to the deviants and bands that influence Queen.",

    "review": "I like the pacing and how it unravels. What's particularly impressive is not only the sleuithing with social media but also the many implications of the searches without having to dumb down the audience by spelling it out. I also liked its general messages about abductions resulting from a root of loneliness, and a huge variety of selfishness as others act as if they were related to it.\n\nIt's a little heavyhanded in delivery though. It also unravels to be a little too psycho, pulling out all the tricks: a girl streaming and possibly getting psyched out by a user; attacked by chance while in middle of night at a lake by an ex-convict; incest from uncle; even the detective being in on it. It turns out the detective is in on it? Please. And that she survived all along? Come on. Other examples of heavy-handedness: the mom having Leukemia and dying. The beginning and end text message of whether John Cho's character would text that \"Mom would be proud too.\"\n\nAs trivia, this is a decent film starring Asian-Americans but doesn't ever make note or rely on them being Asian Americans. Yes!",

I love the sparse dialogue in general for each story, whether it be zero words for a character or with just a focus on 2 at most in a story.\n\nTake \"The Girl wWho Got Rattled\" for example. The prequel(?) scene setting up funny dialogue. The brother suddenly dying. The Chekhov's gun with the dog. The majority of the dialogue setting up a dynamic between Alice and Bill. The Indian action resolving the dog scene and with an unfortunate second death.\n\nA highlight of the movie: the banker wrapped in pans in \"Near Algodones\"; Tom Waits shouting \"Good night Mr. Pocket!\" in \"All Gold Canyon\"; the trapper's monologue in \"The Mortal Remains\"; the hilarious dialogue of \"The Mortal Remains\", as if to compensate for the sparse dialogue elsewhere in the film.. and with its purgatorial allusions.",

In particular it all occurs as flashbacks, which seems unnecessary for a story already based in a period drama.\n\nThe CGI is seamless and I especially loved how authentic it felt to watch an acting CGI cat. The scenes sometimes felt too braggy with its visuals, showing expensive visuals for no other reason. Overall, the high budget did not feel very artistic in conveying any emotions; it was only used to make the film feel more hyper-realistic, which tends to be the case for blockbusters. This certainly doesn't follow any auteristic style from Chen Kaige.",

I also love the family conversation about this. \"Digging is becoming a job now. Now everyon'e s ap or. It took us several hours to bury the first one. But today, Young-min only took 30 minutes to dig a hole. It was like a custom-tailored hole for the body.\" And now they're praising it.

    "review": "This movie is a sequence of conversations, each with powerful dialogue and acting. How surprising for a period drama that it takes place purely in an opulent palace for drama, not action or movement. It felt stagnant however, with unnecessary action, a youngest son, and no depth besides the great acting of Chow Yun-fat.\n\nOpulent. What a magnificent set and costume design. There are tracking shots of gold lining the walls, floors, and ceilings. The costumes and sets are clearly too theatrical to be an accurate depiction. I find that it fits the drama well instead. 1:26:00 with Gong Li standing over Prince Wan surrounded by a golden florescent red palace. That shot summarizes this film well: Gong Li, filiel betrayal, drama, Zhang Yimou.\n\nAs always, Gong Li plays an amazing femme fatale, one with charaisma and a vengeance in her acting.\n\nThe single tear event happens a few times in this film.. I was never a fan of that prop. It looks too artificial and cheapens the scene. The action scenes seem out of place and seem like fanservice. The multiple shot scene when they revealed that Crown Prince Wan is the Imperial Doctor's wife's son: that felt B-rated and laughable. You have to feel bad for him though. First he has an illicit romance with his step-mother. Then it's his half-sister.\n\nThe shocking scene where the young Prince Yu suddenly stabs Wan and goes crazy-eyed.. Welp I did not expect that. I thought this would be a tragedy with him telling the king, followed by everyone dying except for Prince Yu who is shocked at the truth but follows along with it. I feel like that would have been much better. [after watching the ending] It looks like it did happen! Thank you. That scene just like the action seemed unnecesary overall. I did like the resultant shot of the golden army being trampled over, as if they were chrysanthemums.",

The line-by-line boss fights reminds me of Katanagatari more than Blade of the Immortal. I love the character designs. It really does the zaniness of their characters good service. Just like Takashi Miike's Ichi the Killer. I like how structureless the narrative is at times with Manji ignoring people and betraying all except her. Both the lead actor and actress are excellent. The massive fight scene with the crowd at 1:55 is just a clusterfuck of stormtrooper effect. Not fun at all. I was worried just watching Rin and seeing the implausibility of no one going after her. For a high-budget film, it still as its campy B-rated death scenes and gore that makes it Takashi Miike. At the end it just unraveled.",

    "review": "I love the storytelling---from the setup with mystery characters to individual character portryals. It's polished style.  What makes you excited to see more the constant character reversals and unraveling of the mystery. Reminds me of vintage noir films in the storytelling more than the actual setting, which is a pointer to film direction done well. I can't quite figure out its related inspirations. And There Were None (1939), Murder on the Orient Express (1934), Hateful Eight (2015), Barton Fink (1991).\n\nThe pedophilia in this is funny.\n\nIt's interesting that the sex fanservice is actually a male (Chris Hemsworth) intead of females: numerous body shots.\n\nThe mid-to-end pacing is lacking. I swear Denise singing and affecting others in her soull has happened at least three times. The drama with the soldier and ending is too much for a stylish mystery film. The cultish standoff would have gone better if it included the original interesting mystery of how the FBI got involved via John Hamm's character.\n\nAgainst my surprise, there was no serial killer trope! I also certainly didn't expect the two who surived to be the ones who made it out.",

    "review": "Ezra Miller's a great actor. He gets the lines to be self-aware in the film in the same way Spiderman is in the Avengers. The Joss Whedon comedy lines are okay. It feels more like following the style of the Avengers and Marvel's success more than carving its own franchise path. First, it was dark. Now, it's slightly less dark.\n\nWhat's with the Audi and Mercedes Benz advertisements? Very distracting. It's like they're showing two sexy bodies: the actors/actresses (particularly, Gal Gadot who's the equivalent of Scarlett Johansson, Jason Momoa who's the equivalent of Chris Hemsworth, Henry Cavill who's the equivalent of Chris Evans) and the cars.",

    "review": "I agree with the critics that it has excellent style but lacks in narrative and character-building. The betrayal and Benicio del Toro's character favoring the daughter is a bit tiresome. Would have been even better if his character had actually died. The overall subplot with the kid becoming a Sicario is lacking. The story lacks, and the actor is boring. First half is great; second half is aimless.\n\n39:10:00 is a well-shot scene. The choreography and silence in the glances are awesome. Then a girl crying while Benicio del Toro zips up his DEA jacket. Style overall tends to favor lack of dialogue, which is particularly impressive for a film based a bit on politics.\n\nIt's overly stylistic at times. Case and point: 1:10:50. Matthew Modine's character makes an immediate decision and cuts off his video cam to end the meeting, as if it were a power move to show domination. The rest of the cast stand staring at the black screen for several seconds wordless. This felt too ingenuine.\n\n1:14:00 is a great scene of potential character-building between Benicio del Toro's character and Josh Brolin's. It's probably one of the greater strengths of the film. This could have been pushed further.",

    "review": "I liked the overall story from premise to general narrative. The story overall and grapihcs isn't as great as Tron: Legacy though, which benefited from catering to a more mature audience and having the amazing soundtrack done by Daft Punk. It was cliche in ways you would expect.\n\nIt showed the world more through exposition than via the film itself. To convince viewers, for example, of the power of virtual reality and the deceiving romance, it should show it by making the audience fall in love with this.\n\nI liked that the romance was one-sided with him falling in love with an idea. I wish it came out that she was an older woman (or even an engineered older man) who faked it. The fact that the disappointment was a minor birthmark is laughable. Of course everyone in real life is basically the same as their in-game avatar, no one is socially awkward or an outcast, and everyone happens to live in the same location. There's a clear-cut villain with a single person who's made to look like a jackass. The \"resistance\" is bare-bones with just the romantic lead and a bunch of nameless people. Everyone plays a humanoid. The very idea of a bunch of puzzles isn't really what virtual reality and video gaming is about. THe heavy-handed politics at the end is eye-rolling: shutting off Oasis on Tuesday and Wednesday..\n\nThe premise is interesting---that all humans have left to virtual reality and the real world is a steampunk shitshow. I agree with this prediction. But I think the reasons and features virtual reality is far more than what they show. It's not just above video gaming with your favorite heros. It's offering many instances of reality---including the real world augmented with physics-breaking conveniences like teleportation; worlds within worlds; lack of any need for needless teleportation and waiting; lack of actual work as there aren't finite resources so everyone can be happy. I fully expect this reality to come to fruition if there weren't other technologies competing, e.g., immortality, breaking physics within the real world itself.\n\nI like all of the pop culture references. That must have been a licensing nightmare.. They even got the Shining music.",

    "review": "I like the Wes Anderson treatment to a stop motion. His style complements the quirky animation style, and this film clearly showcases his style very well. But the narrative is one of his worsts.\n\nThe way of handling Japanese translations is done playfully and remarkably well. The real animation at 1:09:00ish is especially nice. This is a snippet of what it's like if Wes were to direct an anime.\n\nI like how its a film all about trash and it's not scared of showing dogs in an unfortunate state. It's something you couldn't show with live-action. I also like that romance isn't a big emphasis in the story.\n\nI liked Chief's pack. It's unfortunate they sort of get lost in the story as it starts to focus on Chief and the mainland Japan story. Their dynamics were clearly more alive and evolving. The supporting characters overall were underutilized.\n\nThe story's conclusion is a mix of deus ex machina and implausibility. First, Kobayashi has a change of heart despite the ongoing conspiracies against dogs. And the hacker kid too easily saved the day.\n\nUnfortunately there was nothing distinctly Japanese about the film: no artistic/film-like styles from renowned Japanese directors; no Japanese culture; no Japanese-like humor or structured narrative. It felt more like a \"decoration\" in the standard way of a white man's perspective of foreign countries. Similarly, the 'White Savior' trope is... annoying. Tracy is the stereotypical American who feels the need to vocalize her opinion and make it be heard. She doesn't completely save it the day as she helps but it's ultimately the efforts of Atari (minus the serum). that saves the day. She and Nutmeg are unfortunately unnecessary to the whole film.",

    "review": "Somethings don't translate well to film, such as the opening sequence which was played and dramatized better to get the weight of it all. I do like that all the actors here are indeed Asian (Thank God Hollywood..). It's unfortunate they couldn't get a good enough mix of talent within the right age though. As much as I like Constance Wu as an actress, she's too old to play the part of a high 20's/low 30's assistant profressor in Economics at NYU (she's 35 at time of filming). Same goes for Astrid who should be at the same age (Gemma Chan is 34 at time of filming). I do like that they got the detail that all Singaporeans speak English pretty fluently, and British English at that.",

    "review": "This film is outstanding. It remains classic Disney in pushing fmailiarl values and kid-friendly action stories. But its execution remains so well-detailed and executed. The comedy is classic Incredibles. And everyone you might want to have a cameo does so in a way that really pushes them, and not mindless fanservice (e.g., the black guy, Edna the wardrobe snidey woman). I also love the way they give quality time into individual superheros so you can really appreciate them: this time, Elastigirl and the baby. 'I have no baby facilities. I am an artist.' The way that's said is so hilarious.\n\nI also do like the theme of pushing a political agenda (here, making superheroes legal), and the moral dilemma of doing so by creating your very own supervillain. And motivating business ventures to help fund for this. I wish it went as deep as that and not the cop-out with the sister. But perhaps that's too dark for a children's film.\n\nSome of the shots are so incredibly more realistic than others. It's astounding. Like when Mr. Incredible wakes up at 1:14:50 and pans around. That immersion with procedural graphics(?) is amazing.\n\nChris Stuckmann's points are accurate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKZ7BqwbyPg. The animation and action are excellent. The poignant story is great. The villain is not so interesting but okay.",

Whether sins are forgiven are judged in the afterlife.\n\nWhat a tearjerker in so many setups lol.",

But the way this is supun is what makes this uniquely an Asian film as a comedy fantasy. It intentionally plays itself off for fun, often resorting to unreasonable antics when it knows it can. A country bumpkins rise story.\n\nAt first I thought the climactic twists were a little much, from blaming the eye loss on the Tiger and then to the reveal that it was the Wolf all along.

It's as if rapping comes purely from life experience. And whereas I can see that pervade deeper themes and content, and get to the roots of much anguish in hip=hop culture. It also doesn't really show much and makes it seem like rap is a much less honed art than other mediums which require years of studying and practicing.\n\nI do like the combination of denial, dream-focused individuals who tend to restaurants, construction, and/or are simply unemployed and waiting on settlement checks. I love the betrayal in his love life. Making enemies with his friends and crew. The machissimo pride of indpendence, drug, sex. It's still rather idealistic in its underdog story, pushing for revenge against all other odds throuhg a simple rap battle. As if one could achieve carthasis.",

Really bad acting, cheap props, too obviously well lit and with ample spacing, without any feeling of claustrophobia. THere are so many implausible scenarios, like when the supposedly blind killers leap on to a moving corpse that's suspended in midair to catrch another person. Like, how did thjey even realize that person was there and that there was a cliff? And of course there's an infinite amount of them, all of which look pretty alike except for an adult male, an adult female, and a child. As if there were any other sources of variation in humans lol. So many implausible scenarios---they ask what the black tar like hole with water is. Then instead of leaving it to theimagination, they just have to have one of the Killers come byt and poop into the water as if by signal. Then there's a very forced ininteraction between Juno and Sarah, as well as handcuffing two people together. lol.\n\nThe two way slaughter of the sheriff had me laughing out loud at the campiness lol. There's so many set up specific bouldering scenarios. Unlike a continuous travel, you can literally count the discrete number of events that they wanted to showcase in the film. They crammed as much horror as possible making it so implausible: a ditched mining area which leads into the unexplored cave system; a little tunnel that reminds Sarah of the previous one; a bouldering accident leaving one of them stuck in an enclave followed by minions trying to kill her (and the minion ends up getting squished in the head by the boulder); packed romance among a trio of dead rescuers; etc. etc.",

Just a random set of many jumpscares—that's difficult in general to really immerse yourself and feel horrified.\n\nI always find it strange that the things ghosts can control are TVs, music players, doors, moving chairs, knocking on walls, pulling on blankets, lights. And even the ghost hunters who are self-aware about this don't actually do anything except play along for the scare.Seriously, if such things existed, I'd be surprised the military isn't interested in weaponizing it already. Imagine the things you can do once you control it. Apparently the proof that the Church receives before making an order is also not available for the public to better understand things. If the military were really interested, they would just buy the haunted house and experience it.\n\nThe jump scares in this are just unnecessary. And that plot armor in smashing down that door.\n\nI think the only thing that makes this film save face is Ed and Lorraine as characters, and the decent development of the characters whose only job was to be scared.",

    "review": "Trite beginning, with a very Mary Sue like beginning. It was only nice in its depiction and slow pacing, with a very quiet somber portrayal.\n\nFuck that's slow and brutal burn. Zahler really improved his directing skills since Bone Tomahawk. This one's strength is in the slow burn—which you seen indeed in Bone Tomahawk—but crucially doesn't have to rely on witty dialogue to keep it entertaining. The overall plot remains stale though—just enough to keep the film rolling and me intrigued but not enough to have me amazed. Like Bone Tomahawk I love the especially brutal scenes. Here: a skull smash and drag, then a total chin removal by stepping on someone, then a complete reveral in someone's knee cap.\n\nOh wow. I hadn't realized until reading comments after the film that the guy he was assigned to kill never existed. It was just a ruse to get the drug boss to have revenge on him. And also that the drug boss just paid his way for the visit and isn't actually in the cell. That explains why he's equipped with a cell phone and luxuries. I actually sort of wished it's the opposite, that he did have the real option but just never executed it. But maybe it goes against a subtle, running theme in the whole film that he never had a choice and that it's been forced to him one step at a time.",

Stage left. Dialogue. Stage left. Dialogue. I love how the director fixes the camera to keep so still you recognize things like this. The witty humor is certainly like that.\n\nI swear I saw a movie before with invincible black-tinned savage indians and also a lone cowboy roaming through the lands by himself. Maybe it was The Revenant. Maybe it was Hateful Eight. I loved the perfunctory gory scene with the guy's scalp skinned off, then a dagger to pin it to the back of this throat, and then a complete vertical to smash his junk down to split him in half.\n\nStrangely noneventful. Brutal pacing for a 2 hour film recording a terribly long journey. The bloody introduction wasn't necessary as it could have just skipped to the guy burying his goods. The Mexican encounter seemed unnecessary.\n\n\"You can tell the director is a writer since there's way too much dialog and he doesn't really do anything interesting with the camera.\" https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3qsdqt/official_discussion_bone_tomahawk_spoilers/?sort=top\n\nHah!

I like the traps because they're sensible: they should actually immediately chain through without plot conveniences and have no obvious solutions.\n\nImmediate plot hole from the start: why couldn't they just put the chains where the chainsaw is to see if the chain saws can cut it? if they don't, it would just dull the blades anyways. Next trap room: how did the chains immediately get released given a syringe is plunged in? How do doors get closed automatically to lock them in, as it assumes they're all in at once? Next trap room: Didn't they learn the last time to look at doors to see if things are reconjigured? Why didn't the other guys pull the lever for the guy who's stuck, and how did Jigsaw get the handle to be perfectly so far away to strain the guy's leg? Next reveal: they just decided to recask John Cramer, and it ends up being the exact person they're looking for.\n\nEnding: very predictable. It was completely natural that the two timelines were very much not in sync. The problem with this is the many plot holes. For example, rigor mortis and age of death in released victims, and the liquid blood and other assortments at the barn. The very reason why he survived as a victim is completely ridiculous..",

    "review": "Always found it contrived that the most technologically advanced civilization is also one of the most politically avert (as in a child). It's an aristocracy equipped with tribal weapons rather than a modern day meritocracy and more futuristic weapons. I like the focus on amazoness. And more politically as a film, that it focuses on ethnic minorities and females.\n\nToo many plotholes that make it a mystery of a gimmick. Are they still technologically advancing? If so and even if not, why does it not affect their culture similar to it has affected ours? Where's iron-man style AI? I find it worrisome that any focus on technology is about gadgets and more specifically, weapons. Any realistic scenario would have this socially frowned upon.\n\nForeign aid is too simple to argue here.\n\nWhat's up with the flower? It's like a drug. And even though they killed the usurper (who was rightful), they ended up taking his policy, so his plan worked all along.",

    "review": "Blair Witch Project succeeded by having none of vanilla filmism in favor of more naturalism through found footage. On the other hand, this is a mix of found footage and real cinema, which can make it hard to tell sometimes. This is important because they act differently if on footage vs not. It's also unlikely that the witch has the power to turn off electricity and make arbitrary GPS and a flashlight turn off.. I wish these sorts of myseteries were more plausible. The fake found footage-style even when they're not recording is irritating more than scary, like when the black guy starts running away from the noises, then the footage glitches out when the tree hits him. They also added the CCTV paranormal activity style so we can more easily watch things creep on them.\n\nJumpscares are very annoying.. And trees crashing and tents flying. It lacks any subtlety, which is true for all of the film. This is true disadvantage alongside the lack of genuity in the characters, where BWP's slow build helped establish them.\n\nFrom Reddit: \"Or just have her facing the corner (figuratively) forever, afraid to turn around or do anything. End the film with her knowing there's nothing left to do, no hope, only an inevitable fate that can only be prolonged by standing in the corner and not turning around. Roll credits. A tormenting ending.\" This is an example of a more powerful horror that's less blatant than everyone just dying.\n\nVarious subplots were boring: two locals experiencing a 5-day timelapse; the cut-in-the-foot with a parasite; the immediate setup of voodoo dolls; the rocks; the drone which had zero impact on the narrative. The time motif was interesting but could have continued. Really lacked any new delving into the lore.",

Rejects other ideas, including his wife's. It's easy to see his rise and character as he follows business pursuits.\n\nIt's a little one-sided in portraying the McDonald's brothers. Steals ideas. Miniscule revenue stream. No cash reserves. Albatross of a contract that requires slow approval process. It is very much to the founder's credit for franchising and making McDonald's a successful business model. Not unlike more examples in history of inventor vs business.\n\nLove ideas. Innovation in the restaurant itself from 3-item menu, paper bags, people walking up to get a bite, 30-second Speedee system overhauling the drive-in one. Then innovations in the business model such as leasing to owners to maintain control and immediate revenue, and without any control from the restaurant itself. Cutting down on ingredients to save revenue to continue expansion.\n\nHe becomes so heartless in the end of the film it's a bit eyerolling. For example, him walking up to the Dick while he's in the hospital and giving him a blank check to buy the brand. It's a pretty slanted perspective to him. Even the way he steals another man's wife. It makes it clear how many social norms he breaks.",

I also love the entrance of the male into the picture. It reminds me of The Skin I Live In. Love the random act of finding and eating anything. Love how many scenes just involve stares and eating. The scene where the demon mask samurai comes at the Onibaba, and she kills him through smarts---really powerful.\n\nPeculiar ending.",

Two \"smart kids\", two emcees each facing early or late cancer. Several children and spouses. Love how losers are the main cast. And how they're humanized.\n\nI like the miscellaneous focuses throughout the film. Like the keys going into doors and Donnie Smith's zip keyring.\n\nStellar performance by many. I love ensemble casts. But Tom Cruise especially shined through.\n\nThe raining frogs at the end is hilarious. I love it as adding a level of meta to the otherwise purely tragic story. Brings it back to self-awareness just like the narrators, the characters all singing to a song in narrative, Claudia's smile at the end.",

    "review": "Song Kang Ho makes this film. Another example of why he's one of the greatest actors, easily balancing comedy, humility, and darkness to give diversity to the film. Song Kang Ho plays a good-hearted man, with the film setting up his story well as he jumps into a political affair. The way it plays out is excellent, seeping in details and showing what it's really like to live in such censored, battle-ready times. As a taxi driver, he runs all across perspectives, from the dumb students to soldiers and to the reporters themselves.\n\nMy only complaint is its tendency for an overdramatic flair, and sometimes with less of a grounding in why things were the way they were. The Fast and Furious scene at the end.. Quoting Reddit: \"It's the same thing that Korean movies with any kind of conflict always seem to do, and it drives me up the wall. The movie will be compelling, tell a great story, cinematography and acting are fantastic... and then the final 20 minutes they can't just let it end appropriately. There has to be a big dramatic showdown with the villain, who keeps coming back.\" https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/6yf2oc/a_taxi_driver_nominated_for_the_oscars_best",

    "review": "Attesting to Villeneuve himself, Blade Runner 2049's greatest streak is its atmosphere---a minimal soundtrack (if any) and creeping cinematography. The reinforced themes of artificial intelligence, as illustrated with the main character being an improved replicant and his spouse a house-engineered model. Also how K reads the human genome like any other machine code. Goddamn. That human hologram syncing is out of this world. Love the uncanny valley. And the way Elvis and Marilyn Monroe just blink in and out, singing only later to emphasize the unrealness of it all.\n\nThe story carries itself well, and the atmosphere only further deepens. I liked the reversal of K not being the child. The specific reveal for the daughter though is rather corny, as if they have to shoehorn all threads in the narrative toward this. It would have been more believable if she was a random person.\n\nThe spin on Blade Runner's Turing Test is trippy. Loved it.\n\nThe overarching story of a single child born from a replicant and human is a little trope-y, and a little disappointing. Action scenes are not Villeneuve's strong suit. But I did like the water setting. The amount of A-stars in this is a distracting and pulls you out of the world. I fucking hate Jared Leto especially.\n\nReal-world dispelling from an AI expert: However much fiction likes concentrating on individuals to romanticize them and concentrate human effort, I cannot believe a single person could single-handedly turn over the world with synthetic farming and then engineer everyone; inspecting outputted models purely by looking at their skin and moments of their birth is not useful at all (imagine, e.g., how we inspect current systems; it's through a huger variety of internals and not I/O of specific examples); robots (replicants) enhanced just with the 5 senses more than humans seems unlikely, I can imagine so many more use cases; cars? please...; also surprised humans haven't engineered the weatehr yet; sites for garbage disposal? surprised we haven't solved renewable energy yet; if we can bioengineer AI that good I don't see how it's unlikely we can't build machines that can reproduce as the premise makes it believe seems unbelievable; there is no such things as a soul, and it doesn't matter if your program was reproduced deliberately or indirectly through biological means—they're both a means of production.\n\nVarious sci-fi ideas I liked: + holograms with live-world immersion, as Joi steps out in the rain; a house model; new tools for machines: replicants hunting down replicants, machines as pleasure models or hardy workforces where concepts such as intelligence, attachment, and appeal are additional features that cost extra (an extension of current technology as tools for various industries and consumers) and robots can be interrupted/deactivated at will; a roughly decentralized government (or lack thereof) headed by corporations; macabre, sleek styles with seedy cities with a lack of evolutionary/natural biology in favor of always deliberate bioengineering; a penchant for real vs synthetic hologramic girls (similar to otaku fascination of anime girls); pinpoint missles controlled by an AI; multilanguages spoken like nothing. I would gladly live in Blade Runner's world. :)",

The settings are depicted well, though I don't really like the setting. Story was also rather staler and more blockbuster than Whiplash's. Sort of the idyllic movie for date night: totally inoffensive, partially artistic, budding romance in the air. No real delving into their relationship beyond what you can infer from their impression.\n\nWhat was up with the Youtube piece? I had thought this was set in an older time given the culture and the classical L.A. musical relationship.\n\nI liked the reversal with the bittersweet ending, although still somewhat happy with them achieving their dreams. Even I find that one unbelievable.\n\nMy favorite part of the film is probably the sweeping cinematography.",

I also like how distinct the personalities are across the apes. That said, it's stereotypical to a degree that I also just wonder if apes are personified not because they're intelligent and deserve equal treatment, but because as a story it's easier to treat them as exactly as intelligent and emotional as humans even when they aren't. For example, Caesar augmented with a far more expressionable face, and the ability to speak English.\n\nPrison part is boring. A convenient blow-up setup to kill everyone and obliterate the base.

I liked the focus on the event and the minimal dialogue, and lack of a personable evil figure—just a massive urge to escape, possibly against your own allies. And the three perspectives: land, sea, and air. The timeline was a little confusing: a week on shore, a day on boat, an hour on planes.",

    "review": "I love how the interactions keep lingering. The doctor tries to walk away, but the butcher keeps pulling in with small talk or sticking around when social cues keep pointing to him not being wanted. I love the probing questions and all the subtle jabs: the old man describing how to hide body parts, Filipino wife with the term 'ran away' and then a sudden correction, the gifts of food and jabs at human diaphragm vs tripe. The unreliable narrator approach is great, with dream sequences, individual character dialogues which might be imaginary. The way the story drifts at the latter half is a little stale and predictable, losing much of its edge. It could also have ended a lot earlier rathern than spend more and more time explaining the obvious. The final final reveal with the butchers also being serial killers and the girl still stealing is a little overkill; not really necessary to play the card of _both_ sides being killers. I guess the final takeaway was the the protagonist killed the woman he borrowed from; the butchers killed the ex-wife.",

Each boy in the gang adds an interesting piece to the gang. The comedic relief verbal kid is especially great. The beginning with Georgie losing his arm set up the film's tone really well. Humor in the film serves as a fun balance not unlike humor in Korean thrillers. Tracking shots and effects are also very innovative. Muschietti made it feel much more like a dark fantasy adventure than a horror flick. All the adults were villains.",

Still wish the God/father drama went a little further in potential.",

Everyone is totally irrational, as if this can all happen in such a streamlined way: rogue terrorist wreaking havoc, drama among father and son, everyone having the exact same level of super-human physicality to not absolutely destroy one another, flash moves by everyone, that Iron Man would just immediately attack the Winter Soldier after seeing a simple video tape by a rogue villain (any intelligent person would sort it out first, and also prioritize: get the terrorist first), Captain America hamfistedly making a bunch of memories to recollect as fun stories with Winter Soldier (it's like they have nothing in common to engage in for real conversation), all that hacky cameos to promote future films like Spider-man.\n\nI do find it to be a great production tactic that they're able to blend a large series of films together, always hinting at the next and clueing in fan favorites, while allowing each film to be relatively stand alone.",

It keeps the plot fairly simplistic and focused more on the style of crime rather the accurate depiction of organized crime. And there are some pretty noteworthy scenes: Big D telling a mobster to eat the spoon to which he actually smashes it against his plate and grinds up the porcelain to chew on it; the black comedy scene where a mobster is wailing at another with a log to get the Baton; then cue phone calls with switching sides; then them just agreeing. The car chase scene with the martial artist mobster delivering the Baton while Jimmy cases another mobster in a garbage can. The second-to-last scene with backstabbing on backstabbing and where the bosses are the ones that actually take machetes to hack at another one. Then the even cruder final scene where the head bashes another boss with a big rock and then kills the wife with a shovel and suffocates her while a backdrop of monkeys are prancing around.\n\nPlot-wise, it was hard for me to follow who was with who. I had to resort to Wikipedia plot summary often.",

    "review": "Very well-directed and fluid, with the key focus being the character of Steve Jobs and his focus on success and himself. It's very interesting how the film is literally played inside three preparations for product announcements, going from preluds in the beginning such as a never-shown Dan Kokke to his rise and dispute with John Sculley to his relationship with Steve Wozniak, his assistant, his daughter and her mother, and Andy. The director really displays the ego, passion, and eccentricity of Steve Jobs well. Even acknowledging that he doesn'concretely t do anything---design, programming, but rather the 'direction' with all its faults like a closed source and closed system design ('he plays the orchestra'), customizability vs a single option, and the current direction in Apple with secrecy even among employees. Not surprised that so many would try to copy Steve Jobs, even the extent of young naive billionaires like the Snapchat CEO. And the total hack that is NexT without any OS but just hacking away to show presentation. Or how Steve built a building for the school of gifted children so Lisa would get in. I love the film all the more for describing Steve Jobs so accurately as a flawed megalomaniac, but one whose vision for better or worse has left us where we are now. Awfully dramatic for having to be so dense as a film for so many years of Apple such as fights between Jobs and Wozniak in the middle of a crew setting up for the iMac launch.\n\nAlways a fan of Michael Fassbinder. He's done it again. :) And for a movie that's literally just dialogue, Boyle's filmmaking makes it feel so much more energetic and dramatic.\n\nFor own tracking, interesting patterns related to Apple:\n+ The Steve Jobs persona of egomania, perfectionism, always having your own vision to see through it all (see also George Lucas, the less idolized but still similar in status Bill Gates). Examples: no plates on his car, parking in handicap, homeopathic treatment to treat cancer.\n+ Open vs closed systems: from open vs closed source code, open vs secret company culture, purely closed end-to-end I/O and compatibility with alternative proprietary or open hardware, from targeting users and hackers to force everyone to use more Apple.\n+ Defaults vs customizability.\n+ The dynamic duo of Wozniak and Jobs: genius builder to the promoter and more known endearer to the public, and subsequently promoting images like Einstein, Muhammad Ali as opposed to Turing in setting up the Apple stage.\n+ Apple: The single word company name based on a concept.\n+ Apple vs Microsoft, and stealing from Xerox Parc.\nPremium prices like the initial Macintosh and even Apple Watch to more budget-friendly options; similarly, the specific demographic of rich surbanites to truly everyone and specific subdemographics such as education or users and developers.\n+ Lawsuit obssession, regardless of its relevance, simply for personal aggressions and to put pressure.\nThe power of commercial marketing and branding: possibly Jobs' key asset. Even taking over names to take credit such as Airport over wifi, bootcamp over dual boot.",

Gyllenhaal and Amy Adams are both amazing. I love how their stories never interact in-person and never actually revealing this until Adams is stood up to the end..\n\nLighting was great as was the soundtrack.\n\nThe whole first scene in the book, in its unknown, without guns, and wholly foreboding realism. It was the threat of violence that horrified the scene moreso than the actual violence. Then it impacting the rest of the story.\n\nI enjoyed the commentary by Tom Ford (https://www.nytimes.com/video/t-magazine/100000004799437/tom-ford-on-nocturnal-animals.html). It didn't say anything new but it was still interesting to hear the words come out in Tom Ford's way.",

I found the forensic pathologist character to be insufferable with his various gripes and contradictions. It's hard to emphathize with his character given that we never see the daughter; then again, I also hate revenge kidnapping films that only flsh out the victim for the first 10-15 minutes or so before allocating the rest of the screentime to the action. And then the genetic disease plot twist: yawn.. THat said, I did like parts of the show, e.g., I like him suffering in the end.",

Honestly the main part of the film features brutal scenes after brutal scenes with everyone out against them. This had a very gnawing injustice, but I also can't help but roll my eyes with how blatantly designed this seems to be: an island remote from any communication beyond a boat and a single telephone on the island; protagonist and victim being woman; even the daughter being killed and raped; the victim raped ever since she was little. That said, I can see a lot of this actually being true with impoverished small communities really ganing up against outcasts like this.\n\nI don't understand what the protagonist is there for aside from being a shining light for the victim. Honestly I feel she's portrayed just like Korean films portray cops: completely incompetent and selfish. To even betray her best friend, it goes to levels of disgust I can't even fathom or emphathize with any longer. She's one of the most evil villains in the film: society.",

And also I love the choice of evil characters and Christian symbolism under the guidance of various themes: initial pride from staying with the exile; coming of age; corruption of innocence. The little mystery in who specifically broke convenant and how the witch follows some rules of Christianity is most interesting. From the get-go, it always was about the supernatural and religion.Subtlety is its strength, e.g., the Witch in the very beginning mashing up the baby (unclear upon first view) to lather herself as a flying unguent, the Devil turning into a handsome man as he/she convinces Thomasin to sign his book. I found this article very insightful on the lore (http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/02/23/the_witch_director_robert_eggers_on_the_real_history_behind_the_movie_s.html).\n\nUnfortunately I can't say the atmosphere offers much alongside the soundtrack and the occasional visceral gore. This is unlike, say, Angel's Egg which also benefits from powerful female choruses and crescendos to silence. Most importantly, I think given the choice of setting (an isolated family, one dog, one horse, one gun), there's just too much general inaction.",

    "review": "I really enjoyed it as a outer-planetary Man vs Wild in drama and Survivorman in (mostly) authenticity. The survival challenges and solutions presented are all intriguing: from the initial presentation of the challenge to shimmying water by extracting hydrogen through rocket fuel and ; growing cops through manure, potatoes, and much more. The classic revisit to the Pathfinder. Hexadecimals. I love the realism in communication. First, NASA finds out throw sattelite photos; second, they can only receive most fine-grained through the Pathfinder and send via turning its head; which then allows them to communicate via the Rover. And the physiological changes to Matt Damon; wow. I also enjoyed the intentially bad jokes.\n\nAs a film, it lacks well-developed characters, a deeper story both in plot and world-building politics, and audiovisual atmosphere. But in terms of diversity in casting and well-played characters, they got everyone from a female captain, Kapoor as a head in NASA, a Chinese man heading JPL, and the only romance being between minor characters and appearing in 3 scenes with minimal words and at most a total airtime of 30 seconds. Even the head of NASA—the most villainy in the film—makes reasonable actions in the long term pursuit of space travel development.\n\nI like the overall goody feely nature of the film, inspiring confidence and enthusiasm in the general populace for further space travel and funding in NASA-type programs. Fiction is great that way in that it lets us think just a bit long term and how we might approach such future challenges for mankind. While there are criticisms with some of its technical accuracy and grade-school level thumbs up to science, it never delves into futuristic solutions as they are all capable in 2015; as physicist Brian Cox watching the film put it, \"The Martian is the best advert for a career in engineering I've ever seen\". Overall it's about presenting science as hard, real work and not magic. The whole film is about engineers, scientists, and the occasional higher-up politician talk.\n\nMinor complaint: That scene when Donald Glover complains about the alignment between Earth and Mars being a bad time to launch now, and then suddenly SPARK! a genius idea is so annoying. C'mon, at least stick to realism in the storytelling and genius portrayals and not just survival mechanics. The drama to get at him the end was a little much too.",

    "review": "Ridley Scott's done it again! Big fan of all his Alien films. Spectacles and special effects, body horror, strong Ripley-like female protagonists, world-building, and lurking deeper themes.\n\nMichael Fassbinder is the clear star of Prometheus and also this film. Glad the director put him to good use. Bestial incarnations with a lack of thought are not sinister. It's when augmented with intelligence like that of Fassbinder's character David. No character really shined through except for both of Fassbinder's.\n\nThe plot was paced well. I enjoyed how certain moments were left unknown such as what David precisely did with Elizabeth Shaw. Or why he really was so ruthless in destroying the Engineers' civilization. That said, plot devices can be questionable as usual with Ridley's Alien films. For example, when the med officer shoots around the ship to kill a newborn alieen and someone one shot ends up blowing the whole ship. Or how a captain would stick his face over an alien-like egg after watching David cry as he killed an alien. Or how there are no proper environmental suits, quarantine zone, and medical procedures when they explore a new planet.\n\nI've always liked the overarching themes of mankind in Ridley Scott's work. And as they expand, he explores 2104 as we attempt to colonize, consequently exploring artificial intelligence, extraterrestrial life, genetic programming and xenobiology, and the technical challenges in colonization (at the surface level, sometimes unrealistic but still at least he does). These latter include chemical and geological composition of habital planets, ecology, and agriculture. When they enter a potentially habitable planet, I like how it almost ends uup feeling like Star Trek as they investigate mysteries of the planet: nice shrubbery and wheat at immediate glance; but no animals, not even bugs; and toppled trees indicating some huge life form or object destroyed them. On AI, it's both humanoid and the ship itself.\n\nRant: I still find it strange whenever AI is depicted as exactly humanoid. For example, a robot using a keyboard to interact with a computer; or two Michael Fassbinders communicating through chatting rather than just syncing up through cable or wirelessly. It's ironic: surely, there's more efficient mediums of communication when we don't restrict robots to have only 5 senses. On another level, I find it strange because by the time we have such strong AI, there's a high probability that we'll know precisely the inner mechanics of them, their success and failure modes.\n\nA specific memory: When the Alien is born out of the captain's stomach, I love how it just played symphonic music, as if they were any other blissful situation. And it would be to humans if weren't jutting out killing its host and arriving out of blood with bare fangs and Geiger phaluses and spittals of corrosive acid. I also find it strange that we take tacitly that David destroyed most all the Engineer race when he destroyed a city within a single world at best; and they're most likely a multiterresterial species if they have such grand schemes has mutating humans who live so far away.\n\nI also enjoyed the short prologue released by the studios: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeMVrnYNwus.",

    "review": "Beginning is overly cheesy. Transgenesis is played as a whole mainstreamed concept, with little beyond this to treat the film with depth. Typical to mad scientists, what he experiments with is illegal for no particular stated reasons, giving him morally ambiguous justification that he should indulge in the forbidden affair because of its potential benefits. The whole plot in general silly. It rapidly swaps messages when going from a classic unknown horror-kidnapping to a transgender sexual question without any of its depth.\n\nCharacter-wise, I do like the mad doctor contrasted this rape-y burglar dude. And the execution of turning any other guy to become a woman. Still unbelievable that he never attempted any escape or that there was violence of any form. The lacking in how precisely he forgot all his mannerisms and just picked up feminine ones seems... off.\n\nI do like the shots. The rape scene was done very matter of factly and not made to be super sexual in appeasing viewers at all. I found that very interesting.\n\nWas kind of obvious from the beginning that the girl isn't his wife, but likely made out to be his wife. After unfortunately reading a review by a triggered trans-woman out to fold all life events under her own sexual agenda, I got fucking spoiled under the mere preface of pondering what kind of stupid movies would such a feministic socially charged activist would want to watch. And it made me guess that it's some guy who queried Antonio Banderas to become a woman and thus became his accomplice. God damn it's fucking stupid: critique the film as it is, don't go prefacing your fucking reviews as if they were personal insults against and thus preface your reviews with shit like 'Still digesting this, but I can't wrap my head around this in any way that doesn't come up the same: transmisogynistic and general misogynistic garbage. Feel free to disagree in the comments if you're a trans woman, non-binary, or, for the non-trans misogyny, a cis woman.'",

    "review": "Charged social endeavor. Exaggerated reverse racism and micro-aggressions, both blunt in delivery and more subtler such as when he picks cotton to free himself; like Gone Girl, it's a fun reversal playing on social expectations. The film is an interesting one-trick-pony idea, helpful both in the comedy and in the subtle horror. The plot is weak: I find it a little strange there's nothing in the film except this specific conflict, as if they have nothing else to distinguish them—just a sacrifice you have to pay when a feature film. Just like how the protagonist's mother trauma becomes so recurring and mainstream. That said, I find the film works as a funny little satirical piece more so than a horror. From the start we already know who the villains are: middle-class white liberals. It's just a matter of learning about the details and precisely what they'll do that makes it exciting. The girlfriend plays like Debra Morgan does from Dexter both in her look and her general rambuctious attitude.\n\nI'm always skeptical when stores go into hypnotism. The premise is a bit exhausting and the point it's so weak is because no one can believe for a second that it's realistic, just like when we see ghost movies we are immediately taken into the fantastical, a world separate from ours. It breaks realism. Then the whole idea that he could be dating a girl for 4-5 months and not know she was just fucking trying to hypnotize him when getting through. Yeah, right. Talk about lack of suspending belief. And that a simple flash takes it all away. Interesting though afterwards that after the reveal it didn't just end in climax. The protagonist actually ended up saving himself!\n\nLove the Eyes Wide Shut reference.\n\nI think beyond the commentary and interesting fusion of social commentary, comedy, and horror, the stand-out is the protagonist being able to save himself, and his black best friend pulling out some hilarious meta-jokes. I like that they ended the film with a joke rather than end more seriously. (Honestly things don't look good for him even with the happy unrealistic ending choice. After some cover-up by the neighborhood it'll just like he came in and killed a bunch of people.)\n\nI like the subtler pieces of the film. For example, the party on another glance is most likely a bunch of auctioneers eager to take Chris' body. And it explains the bingo scene. It brings so much more meaning behind the racially charged dialogue when they ask him if he has a better golf swing or performs better in sex. Real takeaway from the film: Only thing I can trust is the TSA! All the revelations pointed out in the Reddit thread are great (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5vv1qh/official_discussion_get_out_spoilers/?sort=top). I also agree with redditors that it was a very good secret that Rose was not just hypnotized but rather in on it the whole time; Peel adds enough excuses to make her innocence more plausible (both in the film's plot and our assumptions about their relationship) (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5vv1qh/official_discussion_get_out_spoilers/de6rz5h/?utm_content=permalink). That said, it makes the film clear that there's not much deeper beyond plot trivia.",

    "review": "I love the dynamic shots. A very interesting look into the 70s and 80s of the porn industry, shot primarily from a young stud's rise in stardom. The mansion with all the porn stars and their daily lives is so interesting. His young naivety, enthusiasm, and his physique bring around everyone. And then his drug addiction coupled with his fall due to the switch to low-budget video production. And how it goes away from scripted films to ad-hoc situations such as Rollergirl in a car picking up a stranger.\n\nThe ensemble cast is very good, almost quite the level of Robert Altman in entertaining each character as a fully realized person.\n\nI find it hilarious PTA can shoot a film so much revolving around a huge cock but can never show it (until the end). I love how they do the bad acting and budget scenes in the porn films. And how blandly generic the Asian culture comes off to influence Dirk Diggler in karate. How stupid these people are are clearly reflected in their dull, stuttered conversations. PTA's neutral look really makes it anshow as an obvious consequence of their druggy environment, with little value on education.",

Hate the jump scares, especially with the audio jumps, which is most of the film. And there isn't much payoff in the various reveals. It plays out like a weird mix of family drama and horror. Far too many twists particularly at the end: Sooyeon isn't real, the stepmother isn't either, but the ghost is real!\n\nThe actresses in this film are beautiful and portray a lurking instability very well.",

Very much a lone wolf, doesn't drink or obsessed with girls, sleeps on a couch turning on/off his lamp's light switch as he contemplates. I love how it very much emphasizes his ability to react and the consequences of his actions, from the premise setting up how just one action can lead everything to go downhill to how he handles the increasing gang conflict with a useless boss' son, how he watches and reacts to the girl along with her affair.\n\nAnd the violence. I love it. Kim Jee-woon can surely be creative. MC digging himself out a muddy grave. The story is simple but what great is the untold subtext and the random comedy like when he tries to buy a gun. How he constantly misses with the gun. Gets shivved a bunch of times during a simple revenge scene. And the side stories with the girl just happening semi-regularly even though it was the catalyst to everything, and the arms dealer connections ultimately leading to his death.",

    "review": "The film captures angst very well. From atmosphere to day-to-day living in the suburbs in some state in America in the 80s. Even the transfer student trope, really sticking it John Hughes late 80s dramas. How real-world circumstances and his inability to control the oppression in his life leads to him to become detached from reality. The therapist says it best at 1:03:00. It's interesting how one-sided the story is in telling his perspective and with few ambiguities. It's clear he's a bright but disturbed child, willing to speak his mind against stupid teachings and ignorance. Even the slice of life is better than John Hughes dramas, with hilarious scenes such as Patrick Swayze giving these ridiculous instructional videos, or Donnie and his friends discussing the sexual situation with Smurfs.\n\nI enjoy the social commentary on philosophies of teaching, posing two polar opposites in education from the old stubborn lady to younger teacher. \"I am sorry that you have failed.\"\n\nAt the more abstract level, I just love its swaths of crazy, with time travel, the 6 foot tall talking bunny, the crime, the translucent worm hole things coming out of people's chests, that crazy lady.\n\nI love the soundtrack from choices in the pop to the original scores with more moody atmospheric. On a technical level, the film is very well shot, e.g., the meta shots with Jake staring at the camera. Or the students analyzing the role of the rabbits.Acting is also great: Jake Gyllenhaal is amazing as always, especially for such a young breakthrough time in his career. THe voiceover with the ominous imaginary friend is great. Maggie is quite pretty in this one. He has great parents too.\n\nWow, damn that unraveling at the ending with all the twists and turns. Eva style. Makes total sense that it's all a dream considering his delusions of grandeur, standing up to people he hates like the schoolteacher and the assemblyman. The girl to protect and fuck. With that said, the ending is a little too blatant.\n\n(I watched the director's cut.) I liked the commentary by Chris Stuckmann (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyePnQTYCG8).",

    "review": "Love the realistic scientific investigation starting with language. The mathematica shots help make it realistic. I wonder how plausible this analysis is to be honest. How they think, their instinctive vs more individualistic behavior with names, how they eat, their purpose, their technology, response via emotions. What are all the sorts of primitives we should investigate?\n\nI like the inevitability of the human's response. Destruction is always so much an easier primitive than learning, trade, communication.\n\nI found it strange that they didn't consider linguistics/language a science. It is absolutely a field of science.\n\nLove that the reveal is a weapon for traveling time. Stays cosmic in scale. And I like how it meshes well with the storytelling structure.\n\none thing i wonder given the limited expertise in science from directors is that the aim is generally limited to broad philosophical questions or otherwise provide overly simplistic understandings and meanings behind the scifi story. arrival is one the most layered science fictions but can still suffer from the overly simplistic storytelling trend to focus on one character, one perspective, one ego and how this somehow has such dramatic effects on the plot. the story could so better from a more layered, systematic exploration, and not end with the nice albeit naive reveal that language is what they wanted to teach humans all along.",

    "review": "I can see elements of Fincher in the cinematography. But the plot all seems overly corny and hard to believe. First, the idea that it's all a game takes heroic film-level layers of witholding doubt: believing that such a company could exist, operate on such massive scales with hundreds of employees to act for a single person, speaking to a television, all the staged scenes, etc. \"What elements must be at play for this to be plasubile as a film?\" These were the sorts of questions I had to ask—which are at the meta-level rather than being immersed and asking questions within the film's universe itself.\n\nThen the reveal from the young woman that this is all a scam and that now they want to murder the businessman sounds implausible: if they all wanted only the money, then why now would they try to kill him and in such crazy manners? I think without much hints of realism, it's hard to invest emotionally into this film. That the brother is so crazy. And the premise about the father commiting suicide on the same year as Nicholas turning 48—it doesn't come up very often to reinforce life's meaning.\n\nThen the reveal that they were still scamming him, holding onto him until he could reveal his bank account information. For example, in one scene ehe checks the balance on all his accounts. It seems obvious that if this happens in real life, you should trust the people you know the longest—for example, the lawyer over the bimbo waitress. As another example, he gets stuck in a sinking taxi cab. If they were truly scam artists, it seems unlikely that they could so willingly risk the man actually drowning to add more credibility to the tale.\n\nThe story also seems all too one-sided with this one person's protagonist. I get that the biggest emphasis is on the mystery abut it's lacking. It seems like it could sdo better similar to Gone Girl where it showcases more to provide a better unraveling of the narrative.\n\nThen the question of whether this is all a game again at the climax. Really now? There were some clear attempts at murder beforehand like the drowning and the very fact that he had to trek from Mexico all the way back to San Francisco with nothing but dirt money, which is very dangerous and the gun with clear bullet when he trailed the PI. Then yet another reveal with the pretend death of Connie that assumes he suicides in the precise location. Then the real ending where he is actually okay with it all and further catches coffee with the woman; it all seems so implausible and feel-goody and unlike Fincher. So many things could have gone wrong (e.g., an actor screwing up, Nicholas taking a different action such as checking Connie's body before suiciding) but didn't.\n\nWhile I can admire the shots, there's one thing I can't forgive in a story and it's plot incoherence. The plot is what keeps the film together. The more unlikely the story, the worse the immersion and the greater the audience's apathy for the various going-ons.",

It's all so amazing.\n\nThe under-the-surface feeling of her going beyond Amazing Amy, both uncovering hidden aspects of their marriage. The theme of relentless media and their biased viewpoint.\n\nThe sprinklings of comedy across the film really take you for a roller-coaster. Reminds me of Japanese horror.",

Nothing much happens and nothing much progresses. I hate the ending. Cinematography and atmosphere is excellent. I feel like this would be better in novel form as narration could more heavily detail the events. For example, the significance of the Man's choices such as running away from the bunker, or his cynical view.",

A little overdramatic sometimes with as many events packed into it as possible: another person, limited water bottles, urine, a dog, a tunnel he tries to escape from himself, a construction worker dying from an accident. More realistically, very few people in the world would care. He would be fired from his job, etc. I think a more explicit ending would ended with him saving himself.\n\nThe amount of money paid to save one human seems a little unrealistic—maybe possible if it really spurred into a media fest. This implies that the reporters are actually good guys in forcing governmental intervention and avoiding other situations such as future construction, more budget onto finding him, etc.",

And all the examples: cops moving bodies, cops selling parts from the department's cars, lack of government funding so they contract work towing, more well-off students paying for drugs in turn funding the drug operations. The derlicht living situations. Low-paid cops needing more cash by offering protection money and working with the gangsters.\n\n1:13:45. Matias falls asleep during a training camp lecture. Nascimento gives him a grenade to hold onto while he removes the trigger. Contrast this scene with the Jazz scene in Whiplash. The action here is so much more emphasized (if he falls asleep again, the grenade will blow and kill everyone) and yet also much more plainly executed because it's just one of many events in the film. With that said, this does seem needlessly violent and exaggerated.\n\nShaky cam, very disorienting during the action.\n\nProbably the most disappointing is that the story builds up a lot but never really goes anywhere.",

The sexual appeal with Emily Blunt and various escapades didn't really seem necessary except to curl more bloodboiling in this show. I like how the film takes a somewhat outsider's perspective to both the drug cartel and the operations, and never focuses too explicitly on one, based from Emily Blunt/FBI's perspective to the more sociopathic operations conducted according to the CIA. And they also don't show explicit violence all that much but rather befor and after to leave things with the imagination. It is very Apocalypse Now in feeling. Especially the soundtrack.",

    "review": "What Evangelion could have been in 1995 and I thank God each year it never was. Pacific Rim is what you'd imagine Hollywood, Americanized culture would do in depicting a post-apocalytpic era where they must defend against Kaiju every so often. While comparisons to NGE can be unfair, I can still say without a doubt that the culture, the undertones, the politics, the soundtrack, the characters, and not even the fights are at all like NGE. I only enjoyed this insomuch as being able to better appreciate Evangelion for what it is, and for marveling at the high budgeted Kaiju.I only wish there was less fucking drama.\n\nIt's so bland with its setup and twin brother drama. I couldn't bear this anymore than watching at 2x speedup to avoid ingratiating myself with stupidity and being comfortable in this mediocre thought process. I can't stop rolling my eyes with the way the main character struts around with his fingers holding his belt buckle.",

Not much individual characterization, but not surprising since it's such an old screenplay. I don't like Samuel L Jackson in this role—it shouts too much Hollywood and fakeness about the whole fair.\n\nThat said, I like the hi-def visuals (it really screams BUDGET) and the artwork around the creatures outside Kong. Great that it focused so much more on kaiju than silly character development and what could otherwise have been much more screentime on sappy romance.",

The story's a little incoherent at times (especially with Scott's characterization). That said, I enjoyed the seamless transitions. The combination of video game fantasy and slice of life makes it a unique contribution to films. It's less like traditional storytelling and more a fun ride with music. I like the twin battle the most. The fighting scenes are just silly.\n\nWatched it again on 8/10/20. Soundtrack is bitching. Love all the songs they play.

It makes me notice just how generic most action scenes are otherwise. How all assassins cover the same tactics, kill the same way, and escape the same way. The hard-cut rules really let it dive more into fictional storytelling than other action stories can (for example, a fight scene being interrupted because they're now in the Continental, thus leading to a discussion). The coins and their amount don't often correspond very well to things they purchase.\n\nI really enjoy the settings. Futuristic New York MTA/Port Authority looks really clean and ad free. :)",

I love how persecution is such a heavy motif in the work, and that Christianity serves as a storytelling device to drive forward the characters. And on a political level, I love how no morality messages are necessarily shoved at the audience's throat. This is a religious film I can enjoy.\n\nThe juxtaposition of very devout Christian followers and terrible persecutions reminds me that the strongest faiths are often a result of incredibly evil opposites. Contrast that with, say, the modern times, where there is a lack of such disgusting persecution. But as a result, there also seems to be a lack of purely devout followers who would necessarily be able to face these trials like those in this film.\n\nI really like how the characters are so often juxtaposed by the destruction they seem to bring with them. And that there's still the longer narrative of trying to find Padre Ferria. I also like how Kichijiro is like a Gollum figure. He and Inoue stand out as narrative symbol pieces representing more than their literal purpose.",

Feels like a funny mix of Gainax-type or Ikuhara-type anime (certainly in the nicknames given to each girl) in flashing out a bunch of random devices. With the music and high school setting, I certainly got a Kare Kano vibe. Oversaturated, poppy Beach Boys-type music. The retro fashion is rad.\n\nIts surrealism crosses so many boundaries. It's purposefully over the top to the extent that the viewer is cognizant that this is a film. Other times it's more subversive to show an effect that the girls are experiencing but just don't realize. But most of the time it plays it weird tone to the max (like the karate). The way it goes from slightly over the top but great to complete over-the-top reminds me of Audition.\n\nThe girl reminds me of Shiya but with slightly sharper, more refined features. Beautiful skin, distinctive face shape, the way she smiles.",

    "review": "Same themes as the rest of the trilogy, with lower class samurai and how they make a living. Strict social castes, weird honor restrictions, gender imbalances, family duties and the importance of connections. The modern lens was a little insufferable (before the protagonist goes blind, he promises to leave the system and start a dojo to teach children how to fight, regardless of caste). Fortunately there was not much of it. The ending is also a little corny and bird cage metaphor obvious.\n\nI like the nuanced relationships and steady pacing. Really helps establish the drama. The long shots set the atmosphere quite well. This is what I think sets the film away from a more mediocre presentation as in the second of this trilogy.",

Remind sme of general anime in which the story revolves around eccentricities from a picky girl, and this girl is symbolic of many fetishes for men at the time. The idle nothingness of upper class youth Bohemians. It seems the style of French New Wave cinema to not substantiate characters with backstory, growth, etc. It all seems slightly superficial. Some next lvl netorare/netori. Are the relationships really this blaise for Bohemians? It's like they spend no time ever getting truly angry and lashing out. The sequence of letters thing at the end was really weird.\n\nShe's quite the attention whore. A 'queen' is only a nice way to put it. Even the ending is a little stupid.",

    "review": "I can see the multiple perspectives in framing his adolescence, initial state of laziness, and how it more broadly tries to reflect the French rebellious generation of the time. Often a misunderstood child with not much attention from his parents, and a poor background, it's clear why he's such a truant and why it only escalates without help. However, I see the film as roughly inconsequential. There's no sense of action to force drama or characterization. I get it's all about inaction that develops the plot. But I wish there were something that brought out the troubles each person has under more light, eithe rin the plot itself, the cinematography, the various pauses and emphases on certain scenes, etc. You can even see the parents try but not enough. There's neither as much focus onto its themes as there could be (contrast, say, with a Bright Summer Day and Asian cinema's take in general).",

    "review": "Coppola really makes the adaptation his own, with brilliant ways to capture horror through film tricks: for example, Dracula's eyes overcast on the cloud, shadows to portray an independent life almost sucking the sole of others, the way he just drifts in the air as he moves not showing his legs during the shots. The colors are sumptuous to contrast the bland. Sex and mystery is high. The journal dialogues to set the narrative keep it novelistic. The individual eccentrics keep the fun high, what with the pure maiden and Johnathon, Dracula himself, the mad man, the wolverine. It's fun seeing what happens next even when we know the general ending. I love the heft of the relaxed speech and mannerisms. It does suffer from the novel's dated style of narrative. For example, the beginning which sets up Dracula is cheesy. Helsin himself is a fun character, let alone his nemesis and the beasts. Johnathon Harker's character is dull though, doing little for the story save for the beginning.\nAs with the novel, I like the parallels of sex, purity, and evil.",

    "review": "Plays out as a moral exercise and also as an in-depth mystery willing to leave out realism. The significant amount of detail as the police investigate is very welcome. I enjoy how it sort of just saunters in its storytelling. The comedy it plays out like is fun, with Gondo essentially playing like a Christ figure makin unnreasonable sacrifices and continuing to do so throughout the film while executives are cast as money-makers. And the way the police are just head over heels for Gondo's heroics, as if they have nothing else to do but help save this one man. In this way it's as light-hearted as Seven Samurai. And as with Seven Samurai, the shots are great.\n\nI can certainly see parallels to a Shakespearean-like rendition, with a discrete act structure and pivotal characters. That said, I think the film suffers a lot from what Kurosawa films often suffer from in Shakespeare-inspired adaptations, which is poor characterization in favor of higher-level symbolisms and morality questions, with a tendency to tell using simple ideas—rather than using the narrative as a way to flesh out the characters and better portray a more nuanced reason. Shakespeare plays get away with simpler characters only through excellent prose that establishes so much more in their moods and contexts. The audiovisuals here help frame the simple ideas but do not do any more to bring richer detail to the story.\n\nAs a side note, I love that the only color in the film is the pink hue from burning the briefcase.",

    "review": "I think this film most succeeds in capturing how humans try to understand their state of being, and their overall purpose in serving out their lives. It portrays it through an ensemble from a family unit, with a young boy, a teenage daughter, and the father. Each has varying levels of interaction with others, where some are more open, openly wailing and asking much help from others, while others take it all within themselves. As with life, the film is awash in sorrow, bits of dry humor, and happiness.\n\nI love the subtle characterizations, such as Yang-Yang seeing the girl swimming and then him dumping his head in a sink full of water to try to experience it. 'You can't see it for yourself, so I help you.' Holy cow that's subtle. I love how that connects to their previous conversation about only seeing half a truth.\n\nI enjoy the various intermezzos with music. It must be Edward Yang's style.\n\nThe cinematography is mostly subtle and serves to reinforce the narrative. Few moments it stands out in excellence, such as mirror shots and a backdrop of lightning (01:25:40). Distant shots during remorse.\n\nOta stands as a good contrast. Not only is he physically a foreigner to the film (he is Japanese in a Taiwanese setting) but is he completely relaxed and understanding of his place in life. This stands as a clear role model to NJ, disatisfied with his work and juggling familial duties.\n\nI like the use of time, from marriage to death to newborns.\n\nThank you random blogger for summarizing the film (http://frogurtalsocursed.blogspot.com/2008/05/yi-yi-summary.html). The subtleties made it difficult for me to follow the plot sometimes.",

    "review": "\"Here is a prime example of a film that defines itself, for better or worse, as a truth-telling spokes-work for an entire cultural state of youthful being.\" A Bright Summer Day is a powerful rendering of Taiwan at its time, viewed from the perspective of a boy coming-of-age, but also from characters around him. As a first-generation Vietnamese-American I often connect to its themes. On one side, there are those that affect all from individual to society at large: the disconnect and response to American versus native (mainland Chinese) culture as refugees, the general feeling of inferiority in response to the overall ongoing war and pursuit of identity, immigration. On the other, it's how these turmoils mix with coming of age: street gangs and bullying, friendship, security and turmoil in romance, the strive for education while handling a slew of other priorities such as helping friends and family, family communion. Friends come only through benefits and proximity; here, implicit that Si'r's best friend is due to him sitting next to him in night school and his relatively harmless persona. Si'r has a need to stand up for what's right—as instilled by his father's teachings—and can't stand the corrpution in his life even when he realizes just how unpure his previous romances might actually be.\n\nI love the multi-faceted characters, where no one is truly pure but a mixture of their environment's distillings. Ming becoming a needy woman who has multiple affairs fleshes her our more than the inert character she was before. Sly matures and owns up to his actions. I love their diversity, from the singers to the mature yet dangerous outcasts. It really emphasizes just how much one better appreciates life by sometimes needing to deviate from the prescribed standards. The ending, with Si'r's desire to findomsone he can latch onto and \"save\", just really appeals to my own overly idealistic tendencies, often pointing inward to my own selfish turmoils and neediness. I spent hours after the film just wandering around my apartment contemplating in all, a little even bawling.\n\nNovelistic. The film's length documents narrative more as a novel than a standard feature film. This provides so many more layers of depth and perspective in the film. It's films like this that leave me stupefied. I'm sitting here just unable to do anything but ponder my life and surroundings relative to the film. It basks you so much into the story of Taiwan you wonder what you can really get out of it. Fuck I'm depressed. Must all truly great films always do this to me?\n\nI love the motifs, residues that only subtly come up. As another reviewer puts it (http://www.movingimagesource.us/articles/endless-summer-20090518): \"A Brighter Summer Day is filthy with symbologies—Yang's strategy is offhand realism organically run through with thematically resonating details. Taiwan being Taiwan, virtually everything suggests fundamental dislocations: the residue of the Japanese (\"Eight years of war with Japan,\" Si'r's mother gripes, \"now we live in a Japanese house and have to listen to Japanese music\"), the ubiquitous American pop (the film's title is a line from Elvis Presley's \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\"), the random passing of Army tanks, the frequent blackouts, the Americanized gang monikers (Honey, Threads, Sex Bomb, Underpants, etc.), the giant ice blocks seen long before we understand what they're for (suspected radicals are made to sit on them by state interrogators while writing their confessions), the movie being shot in the studio next to the school that never actually seems to get underway, the huge net of secrets maintained by virtually every character, and even the father's old tube radio, which must be tilted up on one side by books in order to receive a signal.\"\n\nI found it hard to keep track of the many characters. I paused many times to cross reference which specific character was doing what in certain scenes.",

    "review": "Wow. I love the ominous feeling in this film. The soundtrack. Dark tones. Grit. Unreliable mature characters. Absurdity of specific events. The purposefully glossed over tragedies and racism. The narrative structure. The context for the film is also amazing, released just 4 years after the end of the war.\n\nI love the somber, whiny music overlaying the narrative. Reminds me of Saya no Uta.\n\nI love the Odyssey feeling, and with Dennis Hopper playing essentially an apparition.\n\nThe whole monstrosity set from an American's perspective reminds me just how slanted much of my media's knowledge of the war is based on them. What about films more indigenous, from the native's perspective, or the losing side? And not necessarily about simply tragedy for families and friends lost. I feel like this is more appropriate than just a bunch of people who come over and get scarred even though they're on the winning side, with significant more technology, arms, backup, home support, letters to write and radio, etc.\n\nI watched the redux version. It's great. I like it how meanders, with the focus on Vietnam in a dreamy absurdism, taking individual episodes to point out particular concepts (such as the French plantation scene). That said, I can see how it detracts from the more gorey, raw essence that the film is better at with the condensed version",

    "review": "Wes Anderson's style shines through, a literary chic comedy with character-driven drama and quirks to drive the plot. His use of flat, colorful texturs gives it a fun idiosyncrasy, alongside chapters to break the narrative, symmetrical shots. I love it. (A shame he often repeats this gimmick for his later films with little new. This is certainly the least gimmicky of them all.) A good example is his use of perspective: I love the shots where Anthony is talking to his little sister. And the repeated use of the bathrobe.\n\nThe characters are all unique, with their own quirks and sense of style. The simplemindedness adds to their charm. I would watch a whole TV show about their adventures. Their dynamics are just so amazing. Each can play up their own ridiculousness, while Anthony can also play as the straightman. I've never seen comedy like this before. It's like the humor comes deadpan non-delivery and absurd situations.\n\nThings like the climax make this film head over heels better than other Anderson films.",

    "review": "Bananas is a funny indicator of Woody Allen's humor not quite at its signature yet, just like how Kubrick took a bit to find his common grounding in narrative. But it's a wonderful testament to his diversity. Self-deprecating nebbish with a deadpan delivery—always typecasted but always played well—combined with sociopolitical commentary and slapstick a la Bob Hope. I also find it just how amazing in the timelessness of the story to have much relevant content even in 2017.\n\nThe content here is slapstick, often with the goal to carry out small-time jokes and laughter throughout the film. His signature films derive humor more from characters and narratively built contexts, rather than as two-bit sort of A -> B scenarios. I think this is why I don't like slapstick in general. But I enjoyed the others.\n\nAs Bananas gets into the heart of the film, its humor becomes a lot more story-oriented which is excellent. For example, Woody going back to America after having been thought dead, and now the President of San Marcos, and disguised as a rabbi. The accent as the interpreter was hilariously on point about the blurry line between languages, and executed as a slapstick. Its straight man act and zany music reminds me of Arrested Development. The plot itself is totally a wacky thing you'd expect from a Futurama episode.\n\nThe whole social commentary gives his joke content a unique element to mock political organization and the US. 'Let me be vice-president. Now that's a real idiot's job.'\n\nWoody Allen's hate on pseudointellectuals is a clear indication in as early a film as this one.\n\nSide comment: (1) Woody Allen is surprisingly athletic, which you wouldn't expect from his frequent self-deprecation. (2) I like how the New York apartments are exactly the same as they are now. The doors, white plaster all across the walls. (3) '[...] of all races and creeds'. Like sure likes that phrase. I should use it too! (4) The court scene of Woody Allen acting as himself as the defendant and prosecutor is hilarious. Easily my favorite scene.",

The approach to war here is based on austere nothingness as a contrast to a child's flashbacks to more rich times.

It's Larry David's mannerisms pressed onto how Woody Allen would speak; it just does not work. It's clear Larry David was constrained by a script. A rambling, neurotic anxious man with a Larry David accent. The fourth wall gimmick just didn't click here. The acting, cinematography, the soundtrack, none of it comes together to make a convincing performance. I feel otherwordly watching this disaster. The setting hardly picks up; it's clear New York isn't meant as a location of diversity and education, but it's hardly there as a character.\n\nThe script is okay—middling but salvageable. I can see potential in its pitch. But it's so poorly substantiated. The girl is a classic stereotype, nothing appealing as a nutjob like other Woody Allen deviants. Woody doesn't understand how to depict a real genius academic; it's more like a comedian in the bare bones role as just a setup rather than what fully makes him. As if an IQ, ramblingness, and paranoid hypochondriac describe a successful 'nobel prize nominee'. His narcissm about his intellect is myopic. The boldness of the age discrepancy in relationship is clearly something Woody would do and I admire it. The romance wasn't done well at all, poorly portrayed.\n\n'But life isn't like on paper' Jesus what an embarassing line. 'What are ya, nuts?' Classic Woody Allen line. 'Trust me, if I can understand quantum mechanics, I can certainly comprehend the thought process of a submental baton twirler.' What does that even mean?",

It takes very much from his comic days when there's an overarching narrator and he's more a slapstick comedian. His signature monologues aren't quite there. His persona of a bumbling, anxious, nerdy Jew is there as in his comic days, but it's less him and more a concoction of him and a general character. Same with the subgenre of jazz. Lots of great one-liners.",

As a 24 year old, I can't believe I'm saying that I thought it was hilarious. Such a subtle way of describing a marriage slowly falling apart, with two people finding different interests in life. Woody in this film is such a total cuck lol, totally oblivious to the advances of the other woman while Diane Keaton seems to be getting action both ways. I like the extent to which persons in the story are on board with the crazy mystery, the more appealing they are in the eyes of others. And the way it actually substantiates is hilarious.\n\nAs an aside, this film opened me up to the wonders of tuna casserole. It looks amazing.",

    "review": "Deconstructing Harry is a centerfold in Woody Allen's drama. It demonstrates his layered understanding of human psychology to create memorable, connectable, dispassionate characters. With Woody Allen's razor-sharp humor and rambling monologues he can make an insightful work of art addressing nuanced issues troubling individuals in modern society. I really connect with the protagonist's self-centered, narcissitic attitude to life. It's classic Woody Allen drama but with unique devices to showcase it. The use of flashbacks and introspection is great, and I love how well-written his various distances from relationships are (some purely professional and alien, such as with hookers, and others more warming but highly variable, such as with his significant others). The bleaker dark humor shines through, and emphasis on brilliance through writing over joy in life is blatant.\n\nThe various characters that play pieces of his life, the fact that the written stories are his own wish for how the scenes actually play out—these all add layers to how to he perceives his relationships. It goes a long way to understanding Harry: his quirks, lack of faithfulness, phobias, everything. I especially love how mixed fiction and reality are, like in the scene when he first meets Fay, and how the names continue to be mixed. How even the small stories such as the blur transition into other pieces of his relationship—I love it.\n\nThe comedy is low-key but amazing. This is the comedy I live for. In one scene, Woody Allen, a dead body, his soon, and a hooker are in a car headed to honor Woody. The setup is bananas. How they arrived at that situation is so well done too: the script makes it deliberate just all the various paths that led to this scenario, with him inviting various people due to his neediness for companionship.\n\n'Are you fuckin' nuts?' Love the Woody Allen accent of Brookyn Jews. The movie is quotable all the way through. 'Tradition is the illusion of permanence.' 'So why are you making a fuss? Some bury; some burn; I ate.'",

I view it more as a bare bones setting for a bunch of SNL-like skits. I heard Woody Allen give that dog rabies joke so many times, e.g., at interviews and stand-up; he must really like it to have immortalized it in film. The required jokes for his wife Diane Keaton at the time feel very forced and boring. It's clear Woody Allen wrote the film since he gets all the good jokes. But then again, he's also the only one that can deliver those sort of jokes well.",

    "review": "Excellent mix of suspense/thriller and police procedural mystery---alongside strong cinematography and Korean black comedy quips. Wasn't sure where the story was going. I like how Asian cinema can often devolve in story genres, and here it's also the case. First, the police procedural is a big part of the storyline, and then afterwards they never appear again. Unlike other Korean/Japanese thrillers, the suspects were difficult to follow making the story somewhat convoluted just because of the story structure. I can see why the directory tried to convey the difficulty of discrening a good truth from an evil lie, but the plot itself was hard to follow and not just the deeds from which one must make a decision. For example, the young lady turning out to be a shaman, but giving all sorts of cryptic hints that would naturally lead Jong-Goo to suspect her: she wears the victims' clothes, and gives a weird reason why he sinned.\n\nLike all Korean thrillers I like that it mixes well with comedy and stupid characters lacking in education. For example, the friend policeman not immediately reporting out that he old man is likely the killer. Usually they would just arrest him at that moment and collect the evidence. But the batshit craziness of it all throws all rationale from the man's head.\n\nI like the motifs of photographs and foreshadowing of events, especially with how it all connected to together (e.g., the early dream sequences). And I like the subtle references to Christian allegories, such as the woman casting stones at the sinless man, or the locusts thrown at the shaman.",

I liked the focus on the pimp though.\n\n\"The experience of watching this movie is akin to having your emotions scraped out with an ice cream scoop.

This is one of the fewer violent-based horror films that I enjoy, because it blends it well with purpose (in this case, sex and sins).",

    "review": "Kurosawa is truly the master of horror. Not horror in the way we typically think of it from slasher films, but horror in the deeply disturbing, gut-wrenching mood. I like the hsif tin moond and style of presenting the interrogations. The main character has interesting peculiarities to help distinguish him, such as the guilty pleasure in delving into these mysteries. I also really like the subplot with his wife's encounters with a neighbor—terrifying to think how it relates to the story. One of the pleasures of Kurosawa's films is how casually he tosses in contemporary life—family, technology, hobbys—all while unnerving and unhinging the story.\n\nI love how casually they just revealthe murder, and moreover continued to satiate us by unraveling more and more mysteries behind each problem—rather than one major climcatic event: the neighbors, why Yasuko is calling someone, why Yasuko is afraid of Nishino, the needles, the fake daughter, the burnt corpses and plastic wraps. From the beginning Kurosawa sets the theme of order and chaos from serial killers and continues. We know how that the neighbor's the killer from the beginning—we just want to know how the story unravels.\n\nMy only complaint is the infuriating plot convenience that the cops don't ever believe the main character, and that people keep walking into Nishino's house to their demise, without consequences happening for their disappearance. And the inhuman way the victims start to turn on each other, with little but atmosphere carrying the logic. But holy shit is it an amazing motif. The door. It reminds me of Pulse. We know that once they go in, they'll die.\n\nI love its return to form to the subtle, unraveling horror that defines Kurosawa's auteurism. But I also love how it's different: it's less phantasmic and more gritty and in plain sight.\n\nThe theme of bullying and brainwashing that's endemic in Japan is so great here.",

    "review": "Now that's an excellent Hollywood style movie if I ever saw one. Humor, drama, dumb witty political teases and absurd events, suspense. The absurdism is so great—I literally laughed out loud in my apartment many times throughout the film.\n\nThe whole theme of family, especially bonded through communion, is really touching here. The cinematics and pallette is excellent.\n\nI love that they are not drawing back any punches. They're willing to kill off characters as the story untangles. It draws at superficial Hollywood elements in capturing everything, but really goes deeper in its themes. The lobotomy is horrifying. The terrible policing element brought in by international relations dominating opinions in Korea is prevalent. Communion as a motif is excellent. A quote I like from Letterboxd (https://letterboxd.com/film/the-host/):\n\n'man do US writers/directors need to take a look at the styles of Asian directors like Bong Joon-ho, Park Chan-wook, Tsui Hark, Sion Sono and the like, directors who can take ridiculous premises such as genderbending rebels, Catholic vampires, panty snapping ninjas and virus carrying monsters and infuse their characters with a level of seriousness so the stakes are not only believable, but devastating when things don't work in the favor of our heroes - also, unlike Hollywood films, in Asian cinema, things almost never work out 100% for our heroes.'",

    "review": "The drama in the beginning was very real, somewhat banal, but touching in such a dramtically sad way. The scene for example revealing the suicide is so well-done. An immediate fortune-turned-disaster done so casually. That to me stood out as the most violent scene in the film. I especially like how subtle all the storytelling is: lack of dialogue, and omission of key action sequences like the girl falling into the river, or the attack against the girlfriend once she opens the door, or the final murder of the organ dealer.\n\nAnd then the way the story unravelled is just genius. The continued depression, the anticlimax and vengenance vs vengeance. That retard at the river! I love that the story has basically no theme about it. It was never about people against others. To me it really just seems like an unfortunate consequence of events, brought about by slightly wrong decisions one after the other. This is certainly my favorite film from Park Chan-Wook at the moment. Unlike the rest, it has (had?) actual meaning to it before it devolved into hilariously enjoyable chaos.\n\nOne would argue that Tarantino distinguishes his violence films from Chan-wook's primarily as a form of satire and comedy; but I totally disagree. The entire plot of this film for example is a comedy in and of itself. That the story would be set up in a completely artificial way to construe revenge against revent. Chan-wook has subtleties Tarantino doesn't.",

    "review": "This film goes to show the diverse talents of Kiyoshi Kurosawa. This is such a powerful movie in so many ways. I felt so entrenched in its deep turmoils, identifying with each character to some degree and understanding their actions but wallowing in their despair as they can't quite fix their flaws. I really cried in this film: it was really that moving, both in the end when they finally show case the talent of the youngest child, and in the middle when they go through their roughest period with domestic violence. The intermission where each of the three go through ridiculously fantastical stories was surreal. Kurosawa made it clear just how much this family drama borders beyond realism. As the audience, we all knew how the story would end, and we only hoped it would arrive there sooner and with fewer troubles.\n\nThe tension is unrelenting and honest. No shortcuts were made, and no topics were filtered.\n\nNot only is the family drama so well depicted, but it seamleslly integrates as a canvas for the story. Global economic depression and unemployment, patriarchal pressure for fathers to remain authoritative powers, housewives, and adolescent coming-of-ages. The film covers so many themes so harmoniously you'd have trouble spotting them out with looking for key discrete topics.",

    "review": "That dreamy state, those unnerving long and zoomed out shots. Kiyoshi is so good at capturing an other worldly horror. Eerie rackets, abrupt scene shifts. The isolation is done really well, separating out the cast from anything aside from its cold, hard buildings and technoshit. No surprise element whatsoever. Subtlety is its forte.\n\nRegarding visuals alone, man oh man it's so good. It takes a filtered grungy hue for the majority of the film, with select elements highlighted for emphasis such as the foreboding red tape locking the Forbidden Room.\n\nYabe-kun saying 'Help me' at ~59:00. Holy fuck, that's so scary with earphones on. It sounds like someone really breathing down and whispering it into your ear. I got goosebumps.\n\nNarrative-wise it is excellent, interweaving two different storylines really well. Pacing is excellent; it's very Japanese to start slow and quickly devolve into chaos. I love how it shifts from a ghost story to apocalypse at large. Subtle clues and symptoms percolated in. Brief expositions. Everything just follows through naturally.\n\nThe commentary on social isolationism in the era of millenial Japan is so well-depicted. I would love this film even if I didn't find it so damn scary. It's the combination that forces its horror. The internet as a place to try to connect with others but ultimately producing the opposite effect is ahead for its time.\n\nIn reading online discussion about the film, I dislike how others seem to characterize it as a horror film, or rather if the film succeeds or fails because it is meant to horrify you. I think the film does so much more than this, and the atmospheric sort of nightmare feeling—akin to Miike but more masterful, Lynch but more coherent, Kubrick but horrifying—is what sets this film apart.",

The plot twists are very unlike western films and more like terrible cliches. First she's a helpful bystander extremely attracted to Thornhill; then she's an agent for the evil organization; then she's the undercover agent for the government. Everything gets cleaned up so the storyline progresses without inconsistency or loose holes, such as making sure that they realize that she's undercover so that Thornhill can go ahead and save her.

Great use of framing, some of the shots are really creative, such as the reflection of the window to see Marlow skipping over the ocean waves while the husband and wife have a tiny spat.\n\nMarlowe, what a character. A fictional idealist man of a previous era stuck in this one. The opening scene characterizes him perfectly, especially as it segues into the thick of the plot. Guillble twat. His murmurs are great—reminds me McCabe.\n\nSide note: The naked hippie neighbor paradise is a hilarious side joke. All the jokes throughout the show and incredibly casual pace (man, that opener of him feeding his cat) is excellent. 'It's okay with me.' as the cool phrase. That SoCal neo noir vibe is so fun to bathe in.",

    "review": "Wow, boy is this film ambitious. The massive ensemble is able to describe the culture and setting in Nashville so well. One interesting comparison is to Manhattan, a similarly titled film by a great director, but so different in its way of storytelling, from mood, acts of humor, depression. Some of the characters are so hilariously wacky here: Opal for one (I love her unabashed racism), Haven. Others are straightforward depressing and serious (in a good way, to really show off the diversity of Nashville) such as Mary or Tom's way of women. Others realistic, such as Barbara Jean's husband Barnett. The politics sounding over the screenplay is clearly something Altman would do.\n\nThe film does so much better on a rewatch when you're familiar with all the characters, and can see the clear cues such as the silent Tricycle Man, acting to connect different scenes.\n\nI have conflicting feelins about such a large cast. It takes away time to really delve into one or small set of characters, although I understand Altman's reason for doing the opposite here. It really plays to his strength of naturalistic aesthetic films.",

Love it in its surrealism and mix of vintage culture just as much as 3 Women. love the satire, comedy, and mix of thriller. Hilarious that the executives in thier mind want to produce real films 'like Hitchock' but can't think of anything beyond American directors, and are terribly ignorant of what are good films beside the mainstream good ones (and at best, just their titles). The references to Bicycle Thief for example.\n\nThe story is ad hoc and weaves around basically in some incoherent manner. Plot threads are forgotten about and revived. This is meta, on purpose to take a pass at the making of Hollywood films.\n\nThe passing shots to paintings and shots. E.g., the thiller scene ending at the cut to Hitchock's portrait. The weird music during the sex scene, was this mean to be satirizing that it was necessary and this was their of way of making it not sexy? Easily one of the more disturbing scenes.\n\nAs an aside, I thought the fax scene in the car is hilarious. Who has a fax in a car!?",

I do see their shenanigans and cruelty as human, fully embracing the way they react to stitching back together dying soldiers for 12 hours a day.\n\ndam, beyond the timeless comedy, the scenograph is excellent. even the credits remains to be hilarious. i love the format of the story too, being a miscellaneous collection of antics as the they come and go",

The temptation, the entire draw to the lust and greed, the playback from the start to the main character's ambition. It's all drawn powerfully well. Love the play on Crime and Punishment, and the inversion of luck in the ending. Maybe the Crime and Punishment shot was a little heavy-handed and a touch of repetitiveness in the middle drags on in the film to further the exhaustion by the main character.",

It depicts his comedy so well, with the various flashbacks and movie showings. And it continues in his tragedies, as he often murks around between what is truly Woody Allen and what is fiction—in this case, an affair between an older, more mature woman and a younger and attractive one. The realism, the surreliasm, life and death overtones, the jazz, the way the cinematography comes and goes as a focal point, I can't tell what I love most about the film.",

    "review": "Something about it likes the generic film for the usual Academy Award winning films. It tries to play somewhere inbetween a documentary and a true fiction with interesting and well-woven storylines. But it often deviates too much. I do enjoy watching how it continues to expand its search, especially how it starts to interact with the investigator's personal life. Following more of the documentation trail, investigative mysteries aren't so much there and it smoothly operates without real problems. The 'conflicts' here it seems to rely on the testimonial of just one person, and that chain of events culminating in such a way is so improbable; and the way they fold in purely through ethics makes no sense.\n\nAt 1:03:00, when the music plays while they search for suspicious priests from the book, I laughed really hard. This is basically a database search, filtering to all priests who have been cateogrized on sick leave or absence, etc. It's a human database search!\n\nI agree with this quote from reddit: 'Mostly, I think Spotlight is just much less interesting than most of the other films nominated for best picture. It's completely mundane, and there are no twists and turns. No suspense. It's not artistically ambitious. The only compelling performance in the movie came from Mark Ruffalo. This isn't even the most interesting investigative journalism movie I've seen (David Fincher's Zodiac is much better).'https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/48mr5w/oscar_hangover_special_why_spotlight_is_a/",

If I wanted to see real special effects imagined up to emulate magic, I'd much prefer low-budget 90s work by David Fincher. And why do the magic battles go so fist-a-cuffs with just a little magic more so than aerial and long-range battles? Generic magic insignia and a terrible overarching 'cosmic' conflict.Of course Dormamu is humanoid.. Even the possibility of Dormamu vs Doctor Strange's steadfastness is unlikely. Doctor Strange is at most 40 years old. It is easy to make such a man go delirious against a cosmic entity of billions year wisdom in, say, at most a year..!\n\nAs with all of these super hero films, the script is just so banal. 'fires of his youth', good god, these phrases are just so awful.\n\nI like the concept of battling while a spell was running reverse time though. And the concept of magic as a program, though not original here, is still cool to continue thinking about.",

The girl's spunk is like a playback to Misato, with her english pieces like from Asuka. Symphonies, scores in general, played during the action is so amazing. Damn I love Anno's style. It's these bombastic climaxes that I live for in cinematography; it's personally just so much more memorable and enticing to me than subtler feelings that endure through a film (contrast Anno's style with, say, Shohei Imamura).\n\nI like the farcical approach to telling the story. I enjoyed the lack of individual characters and the focus on Japan (represented through the bureaucrats) as a collective entity.\n\nThe numerous text cutbacks, speed talking, and pompour during dialogue-heavy scenes reminds me of Monogatari.\n\nThere's an unncanny valley aspect to the CGI and man-costume-like depiction of Godzilla and destruction in the film. Somehow I feel some of this is purposeful as a way to continue refering back to the original film and without going too far with special effects.\n\nThe overacting and expressions during the meetings can be a bit much.\n\nJesus, the moment Godzilla starts breathing flames and a purpled beam it really feels like an Evangelion moment. I started getting goosebumps. It's so clear how much kaiju plays a role in Evangelion's Angels.",

I can really see where the submissiveness of Japanese men takes off. A real Mary sue with modern ideals, that one. I like the generic analysis of a hearty family placed in a rigid and traditional system. I, however, prefer another analysis: that angst and lack of ambition brought their doom more than anything. A protagonist who is so deeply concerned about others that his thoughts consume him with inaction, even when opportunities such as marriage and happiness are present to him from one word: Yes.",

I admire David Fincher's work, I have read the Millennium trilogy and have only watched the first entry in the Swedish adaptations. I went to see Fincher's version opening day and the most surprising thing about it was that I didn't love it.\n\nIt's a solid and above average film by all standards. The performances are great (Mara is intense and I loved the subversion of expectations by casting the current Bond as the vulnerable Blomkvist), the cinematography was excellent as expected and the score coming from Reznor and Ross was amazing. So what happened?\n\nI didn't feel Fincher in it at all. I felt he was just on auto-pilot during the entire time. There's only one moment where he took a creative liberty when Blomkvist is tied up in Vanger's basement and Enya plays in the background, this created a very effective and unnerving sequence. It was in this moment where Fincher shone through at all in a two and half hour film.",

    "review": "Jamie Foxx is okay as an actor but doesn't reign among the top actors in Tarantino films, and those stars are what really make his films shine. Christoph Waltz carries this film for example more than Django. The story is also a little too feelgood for me in its ending.\n\nThe black exploitation culture that the film builds on is clearly evident. The homage is great, although it is still a little weird to have Quentin Tarantino be so successful as the primary fetishizer who mainstream all this while being a white man who knows nothing of the actual source, just derivatives. I also find the hip hop to be very off-putting for such a pre-civil war film.\n\nMandingo fighting, dogs eating a black man, the beatings, the black man savior empowerment, Uncle Tom.",

I did enjoy the latter portion where he tries to find his family again and everyone is gone however, and also the statue as a motif. It would do better with more characterization but I guess this is not for such old tales. The miserable ending is certainly quite nice.",

    "review": "Love & Pop consists of similar themes prevalent in all of Anno's works and even in the transition from animation to live action the atmosphere remains consistent—angst for the undecided future, interweaving yet distant friendships, a predilection for classical scores superimposed on violently disturbing events. Even subtler moves are used to preserve this atmosphere such as the the bizarre shots angled from below and capturing a young girl's legs or the black slides with white text, serving as a transition and with a blank, almost soulless feel to their meaning.\n\nIt even has a bit of that Monogatari flair and yet quite a few unique inventions. A first for Anno it takes a cultural phenomena without direct criticism and merely displays it for the world to see. Further, it adds additional symbolism that Anno unusually wields: train tracks, red lights, and memories.\n\nWhile in a fractured and unsatisfying state (or perhaps because it is in such a state), Love & Pop presents what I love most about all of Anno's works. It enshrines drama in its most pure form and seeks deeply to the point that it knowingly is lost inside it.",

It's a smatter of emotion and liveliness, tossing us into thought by seeing the characters deal with love without being explicitly narrated. It isn't as ambitious in atmosphere as In the Mood for Love, and it doesn't aim to be as direct as Days of Being Wild. The work seeks to represent life as it goes on and it's hard to see such a better way to do so than this ephemeral yet cheerful film.\n\nLove the outfit that she has. It's like a costume as a different alias. There's also a freneticism to its energy. And a ceremony, with the passers-by and the ritualistic 12am feeling of the environments. Like it's about the city and situation more so than the individuals. The repeated songs.",

From the most emotional backstory to to the sweet allegories soaring and weaving into their lives, to the way their trauma affects their livelihood—even the usage of paralleling current events as transitions in the play, and additional commentaries sweeped into the story.\n\nIt's also the most insightful use of homosexuality and transexuality, creating an absolutely enthralling and deep love triangle. I adore the emphasis on Dieyei's backstory to reinforce and better motivate the theme; as he became forced to the role, it forced his life up to point of his sexuality.\n\nThe last half hour on the Cultural Revolution with Xiao Si was a bit trying, but who cares. It's absolutely envigorating with its brutality and powerful atmosphere, capturing attention from beginning to end. Its beginning and middle certainly shocked mine.",

    "review": "What an amazing portrayal of deep suffering. I love the subtle dynamics between the Master and Freddy especially. Their foil pairing is simply outstanding with the way they reinforce each other's character so well—Lust, self-control, pondering life, everything. One technique of Anderson's I admire is to portray a significant action by one person, for example Freddy relapsing into violence and assaulting the Master's publisher, and then to portray a comparable action by the other person, in this case the Master flying in outburst against a woman asking him questions about inconsistent teachings.\n\nJoacquin Pheonix is particularly phenomenal in this film, with a constant shifty and awkward stupor. I also love how Peggy is always in the shadows and subverts the major \"Master\" relationship.\n\nMy only major complaint is that the film lasts too long in its (purposefully) stagnant pace. The point could better be expressed in maybe 20 or so less minutes.",

    "review": "Visibly enchanting, Tess is another best by Polanski. Looming bright landscapes and hardened characters of the setting—Tess is a beautifully crafted film to offer the written narrative a visual alternative. The film forgoes longer narrations as the novel tends to do, and Polanski decides to tell the story by its actions.\n\nThe result is a more omniscient, neutral POV. It would take several minutes just basking in the setting and people's routine actions, such as milking cows or collecting hay. What a perfect way for immersion. I just love it.\n\nThe temptation for the film to go beyond and antipicate false moments is awesome. It goes through sheer striking visuals to encapsulate dark characters such as Durbeyfield.\n\nThe drama to lead Tessa's wedding seem contrived. And oh my god the ending.. It's like Dickens and English people's refusal to have their characters be happy. They would go such lengths as to stir more melodrama at the expense of their poor poor characters and lack of growth.\n\nSide-note about super huge irony: Tess is about rape from a girl's mindset, and at the time of production Polanski was hiding in Europe from US feds because he had raped a 13 year old girl. !!!",

Stormtrooper effect in battles and glorifying the trek with little basis on realistic ventures. Subpar characterization of all the dwarves in favor of sticking to Bilbo and Thorin with a key antagonist figure\n\nit could also do without the simpleton English humor, which sort of breaks the immersion of Middle Earth.\n\nI find fantasy strangely racist in that the elves are practically the exotic Europeans, while the beasts always hideous\n\nPace is so deliberate and rushed.",

I love the music, especially the electric beat which remins me of Patlabor. There's also an obligatory explosion, pretty much any stereotype you'd like. Still, for an action series it's quite entertaining.\n\nPlot holes and melodrama aboard! It's not exactly clear how a man beaten up by his brother in the rain is seen in the next clip assumably having watched the sunrise in dry clothes. People get shot and recover the very next scene.

    "review": "Like Red Sorghum, but its characters are better represented. The story is more complex, and feels almost like Vertigo in its change in the characters' behaviors. You can see their malicient desires in keeping the man imprisoned, and not simply forgetting about him and moving on with their lives. The son's turn of personality is wholly representative of the environment he's in: repressed, secretive, lurking. The son is like evil incarnate, whose values stuck with the cruel uncle's since birth.\n\nStunning motifs of water and fire, sumptuous colors as usual with Zhang Yimou.\n\nThere's something ironically deadpan with the fact that one of the funeral rites is that the two must pretend to try calling back the uncle. The scene is an absolute riot, but also painstakingly familiar, thus visceral in its reaction in harking the two's emotions about the aftermath.\n\nLike Raise the Red Lantern, there is also the potential for viewing the story as an allegory for government. In particular, the defiance of the old guard vs the new.",

    "review": "This is what martial arts films should be. Wuxia's strength is its combination of inventive choreography, gorgeous cultural presentation, and a solid narrative. Not only is House of Flying Daggers' action splendid, its cultural immersion is truly profound, and its characters take simple roles but slightly more deviant personalities.\n\nThe film feels passionate with its kinetic motion, and presented so emotionally with beautiful arias and soft melodies. A critic I've read says it well when he describes the slow-mo on the flying dagger as awe-inspiring as watching someone catch a hummingbird. The colors are also quite amazing.\n\nUnfortunately, the film starts to turn into a soppy melodrama by the middle. First Mei's not actually blind, then she was tricking them all along and the House of Flying Daggers knew, then Mei isn't actually Mei, then Leo is a mole, then Leo is in love with Mei and that it's a love triangle, then that Mei really is Mei, then that Mei has to kill Jin, then that she lets him go, then that Leo kills Mei, then that Mei isn't actually dead yet, then she's dead..

The Sorcerer's Apprentice is maybe the greatest short, and the fact that the music was created for the animation means a whole lot here. Everything in the scene breathes the music, whereas Fantasia's remaining shorts are little more than fluffy decorations. Still, I admire the inventiveness that Fantasia tries for, and it works several times, for instance when they use the spectrum line to imagine the music.",

The whole film feels like it's drifting ever so painfully from one scene to the next. Days of Being Wild portrays that lone emotion we've all faced before, and under brilliant light.\n\nOne way it does this is vacant silence suffocating the rooms. The other is the single interactions, conversations rarely with more than two people in the room. The film itself is shot so beautifully in this musk tone and unsteady framing.\n\nThe narrative itself is all too weak, almost just like Shinkai's works in forms of strength and weaknesses. The work would have founded these emotions better had it portrayed the complexity grounding these characters' emotions more than the simple premises it lays down. Yet, the ending feels so powerful and resounds into our emotions.",

The ambiguity of truth in the storytelling is so wonderfully done in particular. There's always a bit of suspicion to be had at every one's actions. It is a simple backstory, perhaps intentionally in order to add suspicion to whether the man is lying or not, but it increasingly becomes more and more layered as the inevitable comparisons arise. Rooting for the man's death quickly goes the other way around when you start to realize the situation.\n\nDepth in the pictures and shadows. Excellent textures. The battle feels a little fake in its acting but it doesn't take too much from the grandeur of the film's impact.\n\nSituational ethics, the touting of the samurai code only when they have a proper bed and nutrition—Harakiri presents itself as an aggressive story pointing out the hypocrisy of it all. Even the counselor realizes this as he takes casualties as \"illness\", touting samurai honor only by name and not by reality. He realizes this of course, and can do nothing but look on as the film presents blood spilled on the Iyi symbol. They truly add evidence to the idea that samurai honor is a facade.",

The soldiers never defy the colonel despite his more estranged commands such as sending those from the sick bay to go back to work.\n\nThe storytelling is diegetic and austere, but slightly pompous and plain in its clean structure. Also weirdly masculine in that the women serve disparately subservient roles and behaviors even for the time. The female soldier for example fawning over the main character, or the various villagers for him.\n\nGreat presentation and cinematic score. The pacing is measured.

The flashbacks don't connect very well together, too little occurs to flesh out their relationships.\n\nSteady soleful camera usage, assaulting silent scenes with raw emotion. It is because of Bergman's authenticity in its presentation that I only wish Cries and Whispers had done more to ground their stories.",

    "review": "Ebert calls Barry Lyndon \"aggressive in its cool detachment\". I'm bound to agree. It is elegant, sumptuous, but alien. Ultimately, it is about ambition---in all aspects of life, whether it be livelihood or romance---and this is why I likely attach to it so much. Barry Lyndon captures a story profoundly emotional yet distant. Coupled with an omniscient narrator, masterful cinematography, soundtrack, and arcting, the story has its share of satirical comedy, strong characters, and tragedy.\n\nMemories:\n\n+ One of the most touching presentations of a child's first love, and a deft way to add sly humor and culture into it.\n+ The satire in the grace that any brutality takes place in. Graceful dialogue to follow a robbery. Soldiers marching senselessly into fire in perfect lines. The sheer brilliance and order of every scene.\n+ The soundtrack, the eye fucking, the audience groans in the background over gambling, the caretaker taking notice and silently judging. The five years in the army really killed his romantic passion, thinking of no more than wealth and stature.\n+ The stillness of so many shots. Like a painting.\n+ The overture music, particularly at key moments like the eye fucking scene or Bryan's memorial or the staff credits. I've been partial to such music ever since Neon Genesis Evangelion\n\nI love the use of impersonations, travel, chance promotions, and change in setting.\n\nVery endearing narrative style. Reminds me much of David Copperfield in romance, youth, and lighted passion.\n\nI quite like Kubrick's spin on the ending rather than the original as well, the latter of which seems almost overkill for tragics.",

It is also overly dramatic and theatrical in its acting at times. They act as if more than human and as if large heroes, with grandiloquent lines and large exaggerations in gestures.\n\n1:00:50 extra playing a dead body that moves. Still rather simplistic in its structure, prime example being Masala wearing all black and weaponry in order to win the chariot race.\n\nExcellent choreography, music, and shadows.\n\nThe Jesus bit is contrived. It's like an ugly cameo with Muhammad-type face covering, and unlike Lawrence of Arabia, the theme of faith lacks any hard work to it. Suddenly a deus ex machina (literally) occurs and they're no longer lepers! And Ben-Hur no longer wants vengenance! Of course they now believe in God, as if living in years of torment within a dungeon and then within the valley of lepers hasn't also been God's choice.",

There is also all that yellow journalism and greed from little motivation other than growing up as a pampered individual.

What characterization really is there in such a cookie cutter plot? What slow pacing for no reason.\n\nThere may be some innovative shots in its time, and all around great shadows and details, but the story itself is too dry and the character too unengaging.

He plays the fine line of perfectly eccentric (and intriguing) but never so that the plot trifles through mere conveniences as Gary Stus like Yang Wenli tend to do. What's more, he's flawed, with sadomasochistic tendencies, a huge ego, and diminishing resolve as the story progresses.\n\nExcellent cinematic scores. Beautiful landscapes, culture, and resplendent costumes under extreme detail with the sand.\n\nThe Sun Anvil scene is one of the most climactic yet naturally engaging conflicts I've seen. What a way to pit man versus desert.\n\nMy only complaint that doesn't lend itself well into authenticity is the lack of languages. It is also a bit glorified and simplistic with single war waging heroes, although somewhat compensated by the reality of the tribe's leaders. Yet, Lawrence still does too much, while there are few influencing figures in the military.",

You can notice that the more educated people are, the more they tend to be unhappy with their surroundings and less content with what they already have. It feels lonesome the way the characters approach their lives, and aptly so for the culture.\n\nThe shifting camerawork makes it feel purposely \"unprofessional\" and concentrated on the characters' inner turmoils. The blatant character analysis provided from other characters' perspectives feels extremely genuine. What makes this particularly interesting is that once they point out certain faults, things just click and all the little nitpicks become immediately clear. The documentary style is preeeetty cool, and the fourth walling at the end is hilarioiusly sardonic. My only problem of the film is that it's too direct with its message, and it causes the story to feel too streamlined.\n\n\"You always get sexual at the oddest times...You use sex to express every emotion except love.\"\n\nThe MC is again just Allen in self-insertion, but perfect for the role.\n\nThe satire is excellent as usual.",

It is wildly inaccurate as to how someone can still gain the foresight and experience that good broking generally accomplishes within a day. But at the end of the day, it's a comedy, so who's looking at it for realism?",

    "review": "One of the first aspects one may notice from Blade Runner is its outstanding lighting effects, which very much preserves its dark and interrogative atmosphere. It is noir as much as science fiction, with the shadows taking the most attention in its overall presentation, and the crime and character motives being the most important component of the story. The vacant sound in its effects, scores, and dialogue also makes Blade Runner feel empty and soulless, complemented by its slow pacing.\n\nIt is highly detailed design in its scifi setting—grunge and metropolitan from its diverse peoples, clothing, architecture, and shops. I also adore the cyberpunk nuances which wields a stark contrast in futuristic designs and rusted older objects. The setting as a whole is extremely urban and the dystopian mood is forever looming from the handle of crime by the police. Natural environments and animals as well are all replaced by artificial ones. Earth is machinated, hinted even further as being a subprime location brimming in poverty and where only those unable to afford the commute remain there.\n\nThe dystopian premise is a bit stereotypical but likely because of its own seminal influence. The story's setup is rather generic with Deckard being a retired detective, known as a \"Blade Runner\" here, being forced to resume his job.  Fortunately, its meticuluous script layers its simler setup especially with its subtle mechanical dialogue and character expressions.\n\nThe implications of what it means to be human is very implicit from the many discussions coming from the humans and Replicants and the morality, particularly Rachel questioning her emotions or in the main Replicant's desire to elongate his life and his anger causing him to kill his \"father\". The ambiguity of Deckard's genetics continues to drive this question as well, though not nearly delved as well here as in the novel. The maniacal nature of the villain and sorrowful Rachel certainly expresses more emotion than ever exerted by any human in the film.\n\nA bit too slow-moving in its pacing, dialogue, and more generally, its consequential nonhappenings, e.g., without anyone to feed dialogue to Deckard or extras much of the mood is left to be implied from the atmosphere. Usually this is excused for, for example its slow panoramas excused by its extreme detail in its culture, but it still feels a bit lacking in this aspect.",

Pacing is rushed, with a character introduced with leukemia kidnapped hardly 5 minutes later.\n\nInstead of presenting any message about the disparity in poverty vs the upper class, it showcases one on some generic corrupt politician. The setting is poorly displayed and too little context is offered. Sci fi innovations are inveritably childish in nature, with many implementations such as the facial reconstruction and force field a gross 3dcgi flaunt. Playing mech warrior is hardly very interesting. No backstory, no character progression, and more generally, no complexity. Elysium's only strength (the setting, certainly not the movie) indicated are the medical services for example, which are surely only one of many nontrivial consequences affecting poverty.",

Glossed over war tactics practically always being successful, lack of depth within the main characters and their backstories, the romance as well. It's not that they didn't have enough time (it's roughly 3 and a half hours!).

First it's the woman's strife, then it's red sorghum, and then it's with the Japs. It's only unified by the sorghum fields as a motif, and the common people as its cultural setting, and I can't say this holds it together as well as I'd like. A parable of China it may be, but Red Sorghum doesn't hold itself to presenting anything in particular. Why it's in the grandson's narrative, for example.\n\nStill, Red Sorghum does just about everything else well--the visuals, the rich culture and emotions, and some decent character progression. I could easily see the novel doing better with a stronger exploration into its narrative and more detailed contexts given the prose. Its peasant life setting too is something truly remarkable and I find Zhang's portrayal of the society right on target.",

The English accents are acceptable I guess.\n\nWhile one can empathize very much given the POV, it's outlandishly overdramatic to the point of being soap opera-ish many times. The progression feels a little too hurried and lacks the proper backstory given other's (and including Sayuri's) characterization. It seeks to cover an expanse of her life but manages to flesh out little of it.\n\nSimilarly, the remarks on geisha culture and its thin veil barring prostitution from escorting makes for a very superficial glance. This is just the same with its later World War II setting. The storytelling is too bare to give anymore than such an impact. A rather sappy and inconclusive ending too.\n\nAt the very least, Memoirs of a Geisha features excellently stylized visuals, basking in geisha culture, city architecture, and even the flowing kimonos down the river during the war. The film makes sure to distinguish Sayuri's eyes lusciously under the various colors within the backgrounds and its romantic light makes sure to keep you immersed in the story.\n\nAstounding acting, though it could only go so far to support the poorer script.\n\nWhile a little strange that her only desire is to serve the Chairman and see him again, it isn't far off from reality either. One easily holds seemingly trivial memories forever in one's mind, and it reminds me of Millenium Actress.\n\nMemoirs of a Geisha is a lush, romantic, and yet poorly detailed portrait of Asian culture through the Western eye; unfortunately, it shows.",

Awfully unbelievable womanizer who gets everybody. Leaning very little on previous film's establishments, which sort of loses the advantage of being the crux of a trilogy.

    "review": "Interwoven highly intricate storytelling. Excellent pacing and character progression, from an essential outsider's view all the way to the pivotal leadership. It also keeps great analytical perspectives about the director's POV of the state. Simply brilliant.\n\nConsiderable depth on the psychological state of every character and their reasons for action\n\nItalian culture and emphasis on family unity, highly ethnic-based, gender stereotypes. Strongly reminiscent and accurate of its culture.\n\nIntimidating Marlon Brando\n\nGreat outsider's view from Michael\n\nRefined cinematography\n\nIf any minor nitpick, I have a problem with how the plot becomes more simplistic as it ages and the conflict dealing away with the Five Families simply disappears (same way it portrays their war). Several scenes also lack context that are properly dealt with in the book/outside resources, and in fact many scenes are simply much more powerful when knowing their context. For example, the significance of Sonny's affair, how Sonny knows it was Paulie who sold Vito out, \"the other Five Families\" actually meaning that there is 5 and not 6 (5 including Corleones), why Carlo would set up Sonny's murder (the vengeance angle is not as clear until someone explains it), why no one punishes Carlo for beating Connie, why Michael is so quick to be boss, the hand at bluffing Carlo to get him to confess to be 100% sure before killing him, etc. I'm not sure how much to fault the film for this however and how much could have been better gleaned upon through multiple rewatches.",

    "review": "Excellent portrayal of isolation. The Barton Fink hotel is simply iconic. Its staged such that you only are ever shown his room, the hallway, and the one time he visits the lobby room to register. Other hotel residents are implied to exist by the various noises constanty interrupting Barton's thoughts, but you never see any indication of them past the noises or the shoes always littered in the hallway. The aura of the hotel is as if on the brink of life and death, stuck in time with damp, murky green colors and a drippy ambience. It feels like a living and breathing motel, basically a ghost ship.\n\nStolid progression\n\nstrong character development\n\nBarton Fink is full of sly humor. Barton seems shy and hesitant at first, and yet begins to rant passionately about his work and then ironically begins to intimidate Charlie instead. The mosquito bites as well are a subtle way of implied actions as well as bagged eyes, and simple glances at the ruined walls. Or when Charlie keeps on slapping Barton when he passes out.\n\nI love how its storytelling always remains concentrated and yet it had the ability to fluidly enter so many genres.\n\nGreat acting by both main characters.\n\nCostume designs are great too, with Barton wearing a drab brown mono-color suit at all times, and with a plain white undershirt to state his mundanity.\n\nThe lashes at several themes are all consistently strongly themed, e.g., the noir element, Fink's craving for the \"common man\". Love of the irony lashing of Barton's egotism.\n\nHollywood deception and great lines by that guy.\n\nNihilistic anticlimactic ending.",

    "review": "2001 is one film never to forget. Whatever your opinion about the film is not so much a statement about the work but about your opinion on what enshrines good art. It is, in essence, an artistic statement. It begs you to question what exactly comprises excellent aesthetics, simple fundamental questions, chilling atmospheres, and one of the most infamous paces of all time.\n\nOne of the most prominent features in 2001 is its unholy atmosphere, violently surging throughout the work to remind you of the stark chaos of the universe. This is powerfully enhanced by its visuals, which is unlike anything I've ever seen. Similarly, its eerily crescendo'd arias are one of 2001's primary tools in leaving you in a state of shock and disarray. Combined with its sparse dialogue in comparison, the film keeps the broad detached view from humanity as the pivotal lens while interpreting the work.\n\nShadows and more generally lighting in its cinematography. Excellent emphases.\n\nI love that one of 2001's many ideas is to test our criteria for what forms a good narrative. However, literally spending 10 minutes in intervals watching simple events occur in slow motion is really quite trying, and I can't say that its exotic pace is what I find to be a strength of the film. In other words, I have mixed reception with how well this actually works on paper, i.e., are these intermissions really necessary? While I find the attempt at a bewildering pace praiseworthy, it is not something I would actually like to see in a film. Do they dilute the more focused content, or do they enhance and/or guide it? I must say I'm of the former opinion.\n\nOne of my main problems with this procedure is that if often fails to capture my attention. With 2 and a half hours of such slow moving objects, my mind runs rampant with thoughts about other going-ons in my life all completely irrelevant to the film. In other words, I occasionally forget that I'm even watching something because 2001 pulls in inordinate lengths of time for trivial events such as a spaceship docking, and a large amount of that time simply watching it descend (i.e., quite literally a vertical up-to-down motion; nothing very beautiful at that). Yes, I realize he's emphasizing the sheer beauty of the event (very well to be the case as from its luscious visuals). However, this only goes so far before you get tired of it, and I would have preferred the same slow pacing but not nearly as slow as it is currently. I may as well be looking at a still photograph rather than be watching a film which prioritizes motion and sequences of events over stillness and--henceforth to be caustic--stagnancy. Beauty from film should also incorporate and sometimes even prioritize aesthetics of motion; 2001 is empty of that. Remember the last portion of the show where it delves in madness and delusional paradoxes of age and interplanetary travel? Now that deserved its slow pace to accomplish, being one of the greatest moments in all of film history. Morevore, there is infinitely more beauty to marvel at within its motions. A spaceship docking? Not so much.\n\nAbsolutely adore the innovations in its science, whether they be sci-fi effects or even simple ideas regarding contemporary culture, clothing, and furniture.\n\nAnother element adding to the horror aspect of the show is that the monolith is so fundamentally grapsable yet mysterious at the same time. This goes hand in hand with cosmic horrors in Lovecraftian tales, where the central \"villain\" is something that remains an elementary, portentous concept. However because it is so universal, this is what guides our subconscious into feeling appalled.\n\nThe same goes with HAL, who despite the vast amounts of superintelligence imposed in his system, has a simple exterior featuring only a red light beaming out from a circular plexiglass. His very calm monotone is already unhinging enough. There's something human about his voice but it's also so technically mechanical it falls right into the pit of uncanny valley.\n\nAs with all Kubrick films, you can see how meticulously carved each shot of the work is, and this is so promptly necessary for a technical genre such as sci-fi. Unlike more objective sources as in comedy, Kubrick's very particular focus is perfect\n\nThe following are excerpts from articles I find thought-provoking and worthy to read.\n\nA quote from Wikipedia:\n\"In a subsequent discussion of the film with Joseph Gelmis, Kubrick said his main aim was to avoid \"intellectual verbalization\" and reach \"the viewer's subconscious.\" However, he said he did not deliberately strive for ambiguity- it was simply an inevitable outcome of making the film nonverbal, though he acknowledged this ambiguity was an invaluable asset to the film. He was willing then to give a fairly straightforward explanation of the plot on what he called the \"simplest level,\" but unwilling to discuss the metaphysical interpretation of the film which he felt should be left up to the individual viewer.\"\n\nI absolutely feel the same way about this work just as much as I do with similarly intensive art pieces: Tenshi no Tamago, Revolutionary Girl Utena, Serial Experiments Lain, the list goes on.\n\nHere is a quote from a source: http://whatculture.com/film/10-common-criticisms-of-2001-a-space-odyssey-and-why-they-have-no-validity.php, excerpted here:\n\"You miss what must, surely, be the core criticisms of the film: it is a sledgehammer, lacking subtlety, wit or real intelligence and that the most central question – the origin of intelligence – is bollocks. The film is dressed in philosopher’s clothes, but it’s fundamental premise is on the level of a stoned conversation between two freshmen students: “hey man, what if we only evolved because, like, aliens did it with monkeys?” Nonsense. A throw away idea in a five page story by a hack writer from the bad old days given the full Hollywood treatment.\n\nThe partnership of Kubrick and Clarke is one formed in story-telling hell. Both eschewed depth and characterization so the progeny of their union – 2001 – is full of shallow, badly drawn characters and HAL. You argue that this is a discourse on machine intelligence, but as such it is valueless, as neither Clarke nor Kubrick knew what such a thing would be like; we still don’t. As an investigation into created life 2001 offers up about as much as Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein. The anti-reductive message of that book is lost on modern, secular, audiences as Clarke’s notion of machine psychosis is lost. Sure, computers could go mad, but would they? Would computer madness look so much like human madness? If so, why? Without the whys a speculative work is just let’s pretend. Stripped of it’s cod philosophical trappings, that’s all 2001 is: let's pretend.\n\nI’ll accept that visually it’s quite pretty, but if you’re looking for painterly look at Tarkovsky (The Mirror especially). The pace is ponderous, but that’s an SK trademark; all his films are slow. As for it being pretentious, it really is. All that dreadful 19th century music crow-barred in to make it seem like art,what could be more pretentious than that?\n\nTop ten most over-rated films of all time, but still better than Star Wars.\"\n\nI don't exactly agree with this because I feel 2001 deals more with elementary concepts that subtly enter into one's subconscious, and as with all other pretentious-lite work which deal with simple themes, that is all it does. This is perhaps the most difficult task to accomplish well in art. However, I can certainly empathize with this point of view and it is not like I haven't thought this several times over the course of my viewing.",

    "review": "Ran is premised on an archetypal base storyline but it's astonishing to note the level of detail Kurosawa goes to in order to mark the kindgom's collapse, event after event.\n\nExcellent struggle in succession, particularly in the roles each of the sons vy for the throne. I also love the court jester who keeps speaking in riddles. Easily the best character, except for Lady Kaede of course, who unlike most \"supporting\" characters has established motives and we continue to see her ambitious actions to pursue them. Remember that scene where she grabs Jiro by the throat and convinces who's seemingly the Great Leader with her amazing abilities? Holy shit is she good. She's even better than Lady Macbeth.\n\nAn also phenomenal character study on a foolish ruler who believes that everything has been solved for once he abdicates his throne. He makes a mistake after mistake and the detached viewer easily sees the poor moves by Hidetora, e.g., when he decides to move to the Third Castle despite objections made those who proved him wrong already (what an idiot..).\n\nGreat pauses in its script, the silence in general during dialogue, excellent cinemotraphic feats with palettes (e.g. the reds in the blood emphasized while mixed with dirt in the backgrounds when Hidetora's people are massacred), awesome scores by the London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nFantastic overall samurai culture, especially in its mixed time period with western weaponry. The army formations, etc.\n\nSteadily improved themes, like a Japanese King Lear in film format: succession, vanity and greed, senility, invocations to a non-existent God, etc.",

    "review": "Oh boy. So over the top. Not sure why the film is so casual with the fact that the two are terribly selfish and are committing an affair simply for the fun of it. I do enjoy their sly humor and romantic banter at least, however so little there exists that is clever, and I did think the ending was decent (though still sappy).\n\nAn Affair to Remember is terribly melodramatic. First of all I don't approve of the self-aggrandized premise that they simply meet because Cary Grant finds Deborah Kerr the only beautiful one on the ship. And oh my god the Gary Stu-ing is unbelievable; so is the sappy strings and the melodramatic overacting which is common of its time. No I don't believe a couple can fall in love in a few days for the rest of their lives. It's never been the case in history; they're called flings, infatuations, whatever; you know so little about the person there isn't enough to fall in love with.\n\nThen the melodramatic plot twist, shoving its already poorly built romance into ruins by the most cliche event. I would be fine with all these cliches if An Affair to Remember wasn't so theatrical in its execution, i.e., Deborah Kerr lamenting in torment as she has a nightmare while in the hospital because she's unable to meet Grant, and most of the last quarter of the film is simply useless. It would have done better to simply cut off until the climax instead of taking so long as filler.\n\nThe obvious voice dubbing and backdrops don't age well (and argubly, neither does Cary Grant or Deborah Kerr's beauty).",

    "review": "Silly anachronisms such as cursing and British slang make for sly humor, but that's all I like of Monty Python comedy. As I stated in \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" comments, I simply do not find MP humor creative, witty, nor funny.\n\nFortunately, Life of Brian has a little more going with it than Holy Grail does if one does not enjoy the anarchic humor as much as I don't. The story's more properly structured (ie more coherent), and the central satire on organized religion makes the film guided enough to not ramble on about the craziest and looniest things (sure, Life of Brian does have some of this but not nearly to the degree of the Holy Grail). For example, the \"right for a man to have babies\" skit was simply hilarious because of its parallels to fighting for nonsensical freedoms that no one uses anyways.\n\nExamples:\n\"I hate the Judean front's people\" \"Yeah! Yeah!\" \"And I hate the people's front of Judeah\" \"..But we're the people's front of Judeah you idiot!\"\n\nOr when Brian is caught by a Roman soldier and is forced to remember proper Latin grammar when signing curses about them on the wall. Hardly comical genius.\n\nIf this is signature MP comedy, then no thank you. This is one form of geek culture I do not resign myself to.",

    "review": "Crimes and Misdeamnors features a slendidly done split story, which I personally find makes it more focused and not as discombobulated as Hannah and Her Sisters occasionally is. Woody Allen and Martin Landau both play involved characters in their own stories, and I find Allen's in particular phenomenal in relating us to his situation. While Landau's has the benefit of silent immersible flashbacks (a cute cinematographic trick I'm rather fond of), I find his moral conflict self-righteous and, to be frank, lame. There is not enough to empathize with Rosenthal's (Landau) situation because he chooses to commit very self-aware sins, and yet he then arbitrarily believes he does not deserve what the woman could do to him in revenge. A heavier emphasis on his backstory would make this move less questionable.\n\nWhile not a major portion of this story, I still did find the environment Landau lives in to be decently portrayed. The pace is great too. However, with the trite premise that his evil-doing brother could make it all \"disappear\", the film allows Rosenthal to face the very bare morality question without any complications. What a drolling conflict. While lacking in its explanation Crimes and Misdemeanors still does deserve praise in how well the acting is done and how well Rosenthal faces the consequences. I like its anticlimax too.\n\nI love Clifford's (Allen's) POV, as it manages to portray a wide portion of his life, i.e., happiness in treating his niece, his financial needs and thus serving his brother in law, and his suffering marriage. The progression feels wholsome and fresh, e.g., when Clifford spends several seconds in pure anxiety wondering whether Halley is actually out with his brother in law or not (the acting in that scene is fantastic).\n\nOverall I'm not a fan any of the moralizing, whether it be in Rosenthal's conflict or indirectly througn the mouth of some old Russian fart. Or how barebones the two storylines even manage to merge.",

    "review": "Excellently crafted homely atmosphere, really digging into the mundanity of their lives and their pursuit for happiness. Hannah and Her Sisters is redolent of all those slow, drifting moments you've experienced in your life, jutting out conflict after conflict while never certain if the means are even heading anywhere. The family is intelligent, and their urban environment stems them toward romantic flings and solemnly darker drama. The film portrays every character's problems, even ones otherwise insignificant in the storyline such as Hannah's mother and father, under its neutral discerned light.\n\nI absolutely love just how well each person's story meshes with the rest of the family's. The branches in the storyline make for excellent subplots standalone and yet they go even further in meshing together phenomenally. Woody Allen in particular playing a hypochondriac is so fitting. His whiny tone, his panic attacks, everything. It's priceless the way his scenes play out, almost as an intermission between the drama brewing among the sisters. The NTR romance is fantastic too. All the characters are so meticulously constructed, whether it range from all the sisters to Michael Caine's clumsily hilarious lines.\n\nThe monologues by all the various characters at different times and the single sentence sprawled onto the screens once in a while. The brooding pace and lazy camera. All of these are so great in painting the picture. Also love its integration of music to help define the characters.\n\nMy only complaint is that Hannah and Her Sisters spends so much time building up its drama through meandering plots that it has no time to release its pent smoothly. Solutions are eventually forced to appear out of thin air (e.g. Lee finds someone else and marries within a year later, Mickey just happens to meet Holly and marry within a year later to squeeze by as a role at the end, and Elliot falls back in love with Hannah because, well, why not right?). While it also addresses the big question with Hannah that she's simply too giving and rarely shares her own problems with others, the film never made the next step in showing how Hannah overcomes this. It simply passes by just as with the rest of the story, and it could have unified the various branches more strongly had the film spent a little more time characterizing Hannah as well as it does the rest of her sisters.",

The male of the relationship Paul is far more down to earth and adds a splendid dynamic toward the zanier high-strung attitudes of upper class New York. He's a character more built-up and less questionable given the premise of the story. Love the Cracker Jack ring despite its cliche end and I like the end message about happiness transcending cheap thrills, although the movie set up so much promoting the very opposite (its cultural significance does so too).\n\nNot sure how I feel about that blatantly racist Japanese stereotype.

There are a few chance occasions in the film to really bring out brilliant moments but it's too often overcasted by the banal and its campy production values. Still gotta love all those priceless moments, such as the total flippantness Tom Hanks' character perceives his situation stranded on a raft in the ocean or the whole marriage thing.\n\nTo be honest the only reason I watched this is because Tom Hanks is awesome, and I have the biggest middle school boy crush on Meg Ryan. She has the cutest little smile with her eyes crinkled up the way they are, and I love her front two teeth slightly jutting out like that. Also her typecast is purely lovable and I like all the things she adds to make it feel so genuine, e.g., her inability to speak when flustered, her gasps, her sarcasm, etc.",

    "review": "The stupidest idea I've ever heard of a romantic comedy aimed at 30+ year olds.. I still love Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan's chemistry though. Nora Ephron's use of cultural references keeps it so down to earth too, and I love her emphasis on quotable hilarity: \"I was eloquent! Shit!\".\n\nEverything else I could get do without, e.g., Hollywood conflict escalations and poor character development, stereotypical best friend (but he's black this time!), and oh god is that conclusion so easily solved. While I find the quality almost as good/bad as Sleepless in Seattle, the AOL thing is shamefully worse than the radio bit, and the whole travel motif of the story reinforced their search for love way better; moreover, their search for love reinforced the film better than this one which merely uses the books as a subtext for some funkily brewed love-hate romance.",

    "review": "Just the right spoonful of soppy romance and a tinge of clever quips, Sleepless in Seattle is easily cherished given very strong perfomances by Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. The radio premise is a great encapsulation of Sleepless in Seattle's strengths and flaws: on one hand slightly original and brilliant with its drama, most other times dreadfully dull because of sticking with so many cliches and not doing good with all of them.\n\nThe setup is a little generic, and the development to the end romance is contrived as hell. However what I love about Loveless in Seattle is that a significant portion of the work is not about a romance between one guy and one girl, but a matured progression given two people stuck in the middle of their lives trying to find the meaning of it all. Still, way way way too cheesy of an ending and all those deus ex machina coincidences are practically on the level of Tokyo Godfathers. I also wished it would have built the two duo's character more, especially in grounding their individual problems past the simple guideline of their premise.\n\n\"Because I'm younger and purer, so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces!\"",

    "review": "Some great lines once in a while; otherwise piling cliches on cliches, 500 Days of Summer is exactly what you would expect from a work adored by young stereotype-adoring troglodytes. The film's dumb generic conversation makes for realistic conversation, but it's also extremely boring and unfit for filming because they wave their arms around with the most mundane and generic beliefs: love at first sight, falling in love from such few commonalities, conflicts spurring from commitment issues which in turn stem from divorces, etc. Neither does having some wise young little sister or generic two best friends make for cute humor.\n\nThe characters are as shallow as their concept of love (or perhaps more harshly, as shallow as Deschanel's beauty and bland, snarky drolling tone). sheer pandering with her. At least Gordon-Levitt's clumsy pickup lines make for a riot at times. His cloyingness is believable (and expected), but it's also not very interesting to watch because it's hardly founded upon.\n\nUnlike When Harry Met Sally, 500 Days of Summer lacks its excellent atmosphere coupled by all the small things such as the charismatic yet relatable Billy Crystal, the adorably pampered Meg Ryan, the cute little intermissions, the amazingly quotable dialogue, the list goes on. This is what distinguishes the film and makes the comedy so priceless. I admire 500 Days of Summer's pace and use of past, present, and future time lapses just as with When Harry Met Sally, but the chemistry between Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt is stale, likely a result of Deschanel's poorer acting (\"This is fun... you're funny~~\" welp). Given that this is the primary focus in 500 Days of Summer, it is only natural then that the story is simply not very great. Still love the bittersweet ending though, however lost it gets in its melodrama.",

    "review": "Rashomon's raw energy truly brings out ferocity of mankind. The bandit's perspective, as well as the disconsonant blaring by those horns, keeps you aloof from the situation. Similarly, the brash faces, emphasis on motion, and the lack of major dialogue keep its atmosphere surging throughout the film. I love the use of minimalism here, where they pull out any extras such as the policemen in order to exaggerate each person's testimonial like its own performance, and where it leaves absent any accompaniment with only the bare necessities of crops to make the film.\n\nThe flashbacks give a detached judgment sort of feel, where you're analyzing a past action instead of seeing it work out in the present. The masterful use of lighting and more general cinematographic feats with respect to its staging are all present.\n\nUnfortunately my interest with the film waned less than an hour in, and my thoughts of its rather campy production values and overacting started to lose its appeal. While I admire its presentation, the story as well as its moral ambiguity does not serve a very strong theme. Rashomon leans too much toward its stylistic content, believing this would service nicely toward its thin outline of a story. Still, there is a lot to be said of its style and I think the film is certainly quite good because of it.",

I still love all the duplicitous intentions and dramatic irony.\n\nMarilyn Monroe here is sexualized here like Megan Fox in Transformers: the facial close-ups, the bad porno music, the angles towards the legs, her presence at all in the story.

Full of pseudointellectuals and Woody Allen's cheeky remarks, Manhattan unironically portrays its generation under an unfashioned light. And it is shameful: half of it is Allen's poorly strung along collection of jokes in each scenario, the other half from a barebones plot.\"\n\nA little longer into it and I start to grow fond of Allen's witicisms and the film's very urbanite attitude. The landscape is so sumptuous, and Woody Allen does a fine job at building character into a live city. I love the diverse relationships in the story as well (the affair with Isaac's best friend who's married, or his half-serious love with a 17-year-old girl). The lack of facial closeups keeps you aware of the surroundings and therefore the environment of all their development, but at a detached distance to keep the show from becoming overly dramatic.\n\nThere is also something irrevocable alien and lonely with the way these yuppies are approaching life. They throw around their psychiatrists as cute memories, their very many exboyfriends, girlfriends and divorces as if they are a regular portion of all their lives. Surely there's something wrong with this situation? Where's the simplicity in love? What's that hypocrisy fumbling about with half-hearted intellectual pursuits, aiming for happiness, and being so flippant and ninny about each other's relationships?\n\nIsaac's very depthful progression throughout the story as well as all the relationships. And I love that at the end, Allen makes direct notice that he believes these people get so involved with such neurotic and insignificant problems so that they can avoid thinking of the deeper, more lonesome questions of life.\n\nManhattan's strengths are its ability to capture the city so blissfully (thank god for wonderful cinematography), its greatly personable characters and relationship progressions. Allen's Manhattan feels purposely like an unfinished product, lost without a particular direction other than to say \"here is life, in happiness and in grief\".",

Learning is #1, and it seems he simply hasn't gone through enough iterations to realize the futility in his change in morality. (Apparently, the film holds the sappy belief that sage wisdom brings about benevolence and charity. pls. moar like totally neutral nihilism amirite?)\n\nWhile I love the idea, there are a lot of things they could have improved upon. The character/setting for one, and avoiding all the more seriously dark elements does make the film rather Hollywood-ish. Bill Murray plays an excellent prima donna but I only wish the writers set up a more intelligent main character. This would allow us to explore far far more into the potential of the plot device, either in cranking out nirvana or fleshing out any themes related toward it. Instead it takes the humility and romantic approach, which has been fine but not nearly as interesting or insightful.\n\nFor what it's worth however, I still love Bill Murray's acting here, and I think his chemistry with MacDowell has been strong but there's way too many hiccups with its sappy storyline (and plot holes).",

    "review": "Kubrick's \"Lolita\" is a shameful adaptation. For censorship reasons or any, Kubrick's choice of direction is so significantly different that it saps away of the novel's passion. As a result, many of the events simply make little sense; why Kubrick didn't attempt this in first person narrative beats me. Without this, you don't understand the context of many events occuring in the film, e.g., all the women after him, or even the scene in which he falls in love at first sight. Humbert's lust and his later bitter pain are hardly conveyed.\n\nThe storyline is truncated with significant alterations to suit the short time length, and for this novel especially, it makes it unsuitable to give the work any justice. For instance, Kubrick's Lolita leaves out the development prior to which Humbert falls in love with Lolita. This (as well as the ornate prose) founds his hebephilia on a much more understood basis. Where's his characterization, if any, in the film? Or when Humbert at one point in the film literally addresses the audience in third person past tense, although there was no prior indication that the film is done as a chronicle. Or when the man lies to pretend he would want to pay the funeral expenses and Humbert accepts the offer as a brilliant joke.\n\nI'm hardly a fan of many reinterpretations. While I'm fine with the idea (it's a novel adaptation after all; you'll need to do so in order to be successful), these ones in particular are plainly awful. Humbert is set off less as the passionate man he was in the novel, and so this stages Lolita as an entirely different story where the events simply happen \"because they do\". Neither is Quilty someone Lo would fall for. She is also literally named Lolita, removing the significance held when it's Humbert's obsessive calling and his own invention. Or when Kubrick removes Lolita's love for only maturer men and not toying with high school boys.\n\nQuilty is no longer the icy enigma that later causes such a gloroiusly anticlimactic ending. Instead, he is some stupendously farcical individual taking so much of the stage when he shouldn't, like a direct joke from the director to the audience, pausing the film for a short moment and saying, \"Hey! Look at me! Don't forget this film is all it is!\". Stop looking like frickin' Woody Allen and stuttering so often in typical Sellers' brash, slapstick acting style. Every time I see Peter Sellers here I see Kubrick trying to add outlandishly stupid 4th wall humor--something which has absolutely no place in a tragicomedy and of which employs literally zero of this form of humor in the novel.\n\nI do like the fact that Kubrick attempts to keep viewers piqued because of his concern that the latter half of Lolita (the novel) starts to try readers' patience. But \"attempts\" are all that's praiseworthy of the feat. While I liked the \"state police convention\" gag, the rest are so poorly shameful: the cot? omg Kubrick humor pls; the Seller cameos? facepalms eveywhere; the flirting before their first time? Humbert crying at the end? Utterly embarrassing.\n\nLolita is played by too mature-looking an actress, and someone surely the true Humbert would not approve of. Her developed features are more Mona than Lola, or at least the most mature form of Lolita before she dashes away with Quilty. While I think the actress is coquettish enough to play the role, it defeats the purpose when she plays and acts like a girl two to three years over her prescribed age (she acts like she's 14-15). Also her sassiness in the second half is simply overbearing, and her end appearance has literally nothing resembling the decrepitness of a 17 year old pregnant woman living in the outskirts of some shitty town, e.g., hard blemished skin, tiresome eyes, darker sagged hues.\n\nIn short, the problems:\n1. Censorship causing Lolita to be significantly older and the story less promiscuous, which wipes away all absurd yet grotesque comedy, and sapping away all of Lolita (the novel)'s passion. Where's the luscious ravings, or all the ironic projecting, or the darker, depthful tone?\n2. Short time length leading to terribly truncated storyline (c.f. some Dickens saga adaptations for good ones, one reason being that they split up the story into several 3 hour films to not face this problem; also their more academic sponsors led to less Hollywood-esque stunts/restrictions)\n3. Poorly made reinterpretations and decisions by Kubrick of what to truncate (e.g., losing out the monologues, all the ridicuously dumb Quilty cameos)..\n4. Ill-placed acting by Peter Sellers and Sue Lyon.\n5. Mediocre soundtrack, several times played at the wrong times. When Humbert tries to take away Lolita at the end of the film and proposes to her, vastly sentimental music plays in the background and I simply couldn't keep my eyes open to watch in embarassment. It's like watching two grown men trying to fuck by smashing their dicks together. (Sound stupid? Then you know my feelings on that scene.)\n\nWhat can I praise? I guess the camera shots, how Lolita acts so casually and risque at times, several scenes in the first half. James Mason's Humbert Humbert is fine, but he's way way too old (he should be mid-30's, not fucking 55-going-on-dinosaur=ages).",

    "review": "Stupid, tasteless, unfunny cliches. Just not my type of comedy I guess, but I find low brow comedy akin to the intellectually stimulating appeal of fart jokes a universally poor work. It's predictable as much as a raging teen masturbates to the most subtle gestures, and it bloats itself with its dire need to be funny. Lacking any cleverness, Airplane! is an utter droll.\n\nI'll be fair and say that several scenes are pretty brilliant but they're overcasted so frequently by the stupidest jokes. Just for hard examples, let's indicate a few. When the doctor says, \"Lemme see your tongue\", and then the woman proceeds to keep jutting eggs from her mouth, I found that mildly amusing. Also when the main character tries to teach a rural tribe basketball and proceeds to downplay the exponential rate at which they were learning. Everything else is practically stupid, e.g., a little girl clad in gentry claiming, \"I like my coffee black.. just like my men\"; an attendant saying, \"I think he's a doctor\", proceeded by a shot showing a man with a stethoscope on his ears; \"This woman needs to be taken to a hospital.\n A hospital, what is it?\n A big building with patients, but that's no worry right now\"; \"Captain, how soon can you land?\n I can't tell.\n You can tell me, I'm a doctor.\"",

Clarice on the other hand is a little boring given her stock archetype; so is the setting, and anything else save for the occasional behavioral study dialogue on the serial killers which reinforce the impact of their actions. Honestly however Silence of the Lamb is not very exciting given so much I've seen from previous serial killer works and Sherlock/Moriarty figures. The pace goes back and forth between a study on Lecter and one on the case at large, which is a ambitious allocation of time given just how lame Buffalo Bill's side is. He's so poorly clarified and contrasted drastically by Hopkin's stupendous performance as Lecter, that much of the thrill regarding this main story is thrown out the door. Hannibal escaping from confinment is the climax, not Foster killing Buffalo Bill.",

    "review": "Taxi Driver is Scorsese's most famous dark, gritty film: filled to the brim with decadence, and a protagonist so astoundingly lost in his need to make justice of it all. For this, the film brings insight upon insight regarding the metropolitan state, shocking viewers at just how dark humanity can get. Taxi Driver's setting is easily its best element.\n\nTravis however wields mixed merits. His jumbled words for instance often leave the dialogue lacking. This is attributed to his poor education for sure, but it also makes his service into the role quite lackluster as we would like him to state something holding more weight, but he is unable to communicate his thoughts. When he tries to comment about the city's state toward others for example, there's so much to be said and yet he hesitates and continues to stutter on with incomprehensible meanings and slang. This is similar to a lot of other uneducated characters in the story, and while it makes sense logically it weakens the overall impact and precision in the film. What remains excellent at least is De Niro's excellent potrayal of such a pathetic and paranoid individual.\n\nHis stating relationship with Betty is quite questionable purpose-wise as well as how it even develops in the first place. This goes hand in hand with how his relationship with Iris feels so fleeting and leaves so much more to be desired.\n\nThe decrecendos and dissonance in the jazz, those soulful whimpers so attuned toward the decadence that the film portrays, builds up phenomenal atmosphere in the work.\n\nUnfortunately Taxi Driver feels unnecessarily lost in its own narrative, seeping deeper and deeper into Travis' insanity and paranoia so much that you forget the purpose of Taxi Driver anymore. When Travis seeks to assassinate senator Palantine (and ultimately fails), and then kills the pimp because he has no one else to kill, the film tries to add in a spin on media criticism, indicating that despite the very polar stances the media would take if he had killed the senator instead, it turns to be some half-assed ironic gesture, something that was not displayed in prior events in the film. Also you can't help being left with a sour taste in your mouth as the relationships with Betty and Iris feel so brief, and the film as a whole quite inconclusive.",

Most noticeable are the cinematography, excellent pacing and character story with the tragedy that is Daniel Plainview, excellent acting (including Eli), and horrifying soundtrack to define tension. Daniel Day Lewis' gripping acting in key scenes are so excelltn: beating down Eli, the baptism, the final scenes. I like the repeated speeches: the rehearsed speech about being a family man at the beginning toward later during the oil rendering with the Sunday family; and the confession from Daniel to Eli at the final scene.\n\nI love the dialogue scenes, with Daniel clearly being miserly in the way he relays information to others. And I love the series of betrayals with the way he latches onto H.W., then his supposed brother, and then back onto H.W. Eli as a preacher is an excellent antagonist to him.",

    "review": "What an emotionally cathartic journey. The Shawshank Redemption is one film I'd have a hard time describing what distinguishes so evanescently from everything else, even though its appeal is so natural and universally applicable that just about everyone adores it.\n\nInsightful about prison structure and life, ranging alll the way from entrance to exit with Brook's.\n\nExcellent cinematography\n\nOne of the greatest relatable yet enigmatic MC, as well as a good sidekick to boot. Tim Robbins plays one of the most charismatic characters there is in film, with bright shining eyes that look so forwardly into your own.\n\nI love the span of the film as it meanders about with all the different routes from supporting characters and goes slows as balls.\n\nFreeman's narration is strongly redolent of misery, regret, some deeper desire to find the soul and be content with it.\n\nMy only complaint? The incredibly cheesy closer (just like the director in the trivia notes state, it would have been better to conclude slightly more ambiguously, where Red is on the bus looking for Andy), and the general positive way it ended in how he even escapes.\n\ntaken from imdb:\n\"In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were \"just happy to be nominated.\" Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word \"go,\" making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.\n\nAfter opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on \"that 'Rickshaw' movie.\" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, \"it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale.\" But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.\n\nFirstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; \"In here's where you need it most,\" he says. \"You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch.\" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking \"that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass\" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it.\n\nIt's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well over 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going, it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be forgotten.\n\nWith themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they come. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving film, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much better than this.\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says, \"It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying.\"#\"",

And the multiple perspectives, including each one taking dirty hits. The offstage death. The fear in Tommy Lee Jones' eyes when looking at the blasted door lock. The mystery behind all the action and the role of the sherriff. It's an interesting Coen Brothers film when the supporting character villain Anton Chigurh takes on the spotlight even more so than the sherriff and the protagonist (although both also well-acted).",

    "review": "All that meandering dialogue is both Pulp Fiction's greatest strength and weakness. At times it feels extremely redundant, superficial, and gimmicky. On all the other occasions, the rhythm of the work's mocks at the audience to build suspense is wildly entertaining. Excellent monologue overall as well as how (most of) all the nonlinear stories converge. Trying to the irregular story and the adventures of the duo is something that's plainly fun and active. The film's mood feels homey, totally at rest with how it tells its story.\n\nGreat cinematography in trailing characters and following people's dufferent possibilities. Vacant sound to lend to the atmosphere.\n\nAfter having experienced quite a few foreign films (Chinese and Korean especially) with the original tone Tarantino seeks after, I can really depreciate this film. These foreign films have so much more authenticity and creativity in them. Their raw emotions—for example, Sympathy for Vengeance's violence—is so much more shocking yet palatable than Pulp Fiction's, even if Sympathy was made afterwards.",

    "review": "So many scenes are on point: the scalping, all the scenes with Christoph Waltz, especially the one where he just laughs at Brigitte's face when she claims she got the new cast from mountain-climbing; the bar scene; the Hans Landa negotiation; the cinema fire. Tarantino is also so good at enrichening his brutal action with comedy. And unpredictable deaths. That's half what makes Tarantino films so good.\n\nI like how in the end it represents three plot thread perspectives: the Americans, the British, and Shoshanna representing the European Jewish. The ending is also pretty representative of the three cultures: the Americans take over the British's plan, almost fail entirely, and take all the glory; the British devised the plan but incur all the casualties; and the Jewish trekked it alone and will go through history unnoticed.\n\nI also like the more subtle aspects: for example, Shoshanna's real love interest being a black Frenchman; Hans Landa possibly being gay with the radio operator (was this deliberate? \"I made a deal with your general for that man's life!\"); and the noose scar on Aldo's neck.\n\nTo me, this is the like the typical Tarantino film with its iconic ramp-up in brutality, acting bravado with especially memorable scenes, peculiar fetishisms, and homage to a particular culture or industry. Almost like Coen Brothers and Wes Anderson, Tarantino films to me are like the best film for a college student, or for watching as a dinner movie. They don't get all that deeper or sadder than their surface appearance. It's mostly fun, often brainless albeit truly well-shot, action.",

    "review": "Rewatching in 2021, I can really appreciate the cinematography and atmosphere more than when I first watched it. What elevates the film above a solid serial killer thriller is its use of both graphic imagery and suggestive imagery (Lust and the climax), as well as the film concentrating well around the characters, with a larger narrative around apathy and sin.\n\nPlot hole-wise, it's a little contrived for them to be able to comb through multiple crime scenes and even the main apartment without finding a single fingerprint or DNA sample. They don't even collect eyewitness samples of what the guy looks like from the multiple victims or witnesses that survived.",

Half the film being \"Oh yeah. Yeah!\" gets hilarious but also pretty tiresome.\n\nThe amount of unsaid, wallowing pity is so much.\n\nI don't get the point of the film though. It sort of just moves on at its own pace with its own failures to no real reason or theme.",

    "review": "I wish I could really dig Monty Python humor sometimes but it's so plainly stupid and absurd. I wonder if I rewatch this now, if I'd enjoy it more but I find this unlikely. If I don't find Saturday Night Live any good (as most who like Monty Python like SNL), I don't imagine multiple rewatches would let me appreciate the Holy Grail more.\n\nIt's not that I don't \"get\" MP humor. I think it's more a tell tale sign that I believe retard sculptures, absurdist, and hypebolically exaggerated slapstick humor is hardly funny. Take the black knight skit for example where the moron's just swinging around after losing a bunch of limbs. Give me a witty pun and I'll be laughing (which Holy Grail does do a few times). Hitting a bloke over and over again, or shouting nonsensical phrases? Not so much. Degenerate, silly, forcefully repititive comedy is no good!\n\nThis is just a side comment not related to the quality of Monty Python humuor, but I find the fanbase so atrocious. To fault anyone who does not share your belief (in this case, that MP is funny) with the absurd idea that he simply doesn't \"understand\", is the equivalent of evangelists, soothsayers, and hillbilly Christians. Let's also note, mind you, that this is one of the messages MP's Life of Brian makes fun of.",

Some really awkward acting with Sheen trying to deceive others. I'm not sure whether to attribute that to Sheen's own lacluster acting or the fictional character's.\n\nExcllent command of morality, human superiority, and the reckoning of greed.\n\nAlso the need to localize to one person's problems.",

    "review": "Exctellent main character with class A acting. One of the most down-to-earth, relatable protagonists I can really empathize with.\n\nBoiler Room households phenomenal progression and makes the whole conflict a seemingly natural storyline. Each character faces the same morality questions that MC does, and the various ways they cope with that is quite astounding.\n\nPretty cheesy romance as well as the dad blip.\n\nGreat dance with the moralism affair, especially with how his friend continues to ground him in it.\n\nMy only complaints is the rather high-strung, exaggerated action along with the neeed to close the firm so violently and leave such a sordid message with everything inconclusive.\n\n\"It isn't going to win too many awards; it is simplistic, slapdash and a little goofy. But it captures the swagger and the patter of the young obnoxious stock-hawkers perfectly.\"",

    "review": "\"If the film sounds like a mess of relationships, then it is. As muddled as Stone's own political activism it has no clarity on what its trying to say. From trying to rationalize the reasons behind the market crash to the impulsive nature of human behaviour, it doesn't get either right.\"\n\nFar more believable romance that comes crushing to nothing and lack of stronger characterization.w;w\n\nLess insights on Wall Street and pretty generic Hollywood execution of a financial collapse, with little insighs of how each position did their job in the sector.\n\nGordan Gekko as an antihero isn't as charismatic here. No, it's not because he no longer has wads of cash flying out of his mouth as he speaks, but his dialogue, his composure, the cinematography made to enhance his charisma, are not prevalent here. It was also the stark contrast between Gekko and amateur Bud Fox which made their positions stand out all the more. When you recognize Bud's cheap formulaic \"appreciations\" and \"speeches\" you begin to apprceiate what makes Gekko such a fantastic figure.\n\nHollywood montages of music played by intermittent\n\nShia LeBouf plays an excellent character here, and his dynamic with his fiance, father figure, and even his conversations with his mother are believable. Far stronger and developed character than Bud Fox.\n\nThis is a sequel to a classic but unfortunately built with some generic Hollywood plays. While Shia LeBouf's acting lifts up the show, he can only do so much.\n\nwall street cameo by Charlie Sheen is a stupid conclusion that no one really cares about.\n\nreally starts to unhinge itself 3/4 way through\n\nton of exaggeration about the impact of the financial crisis (even saying \"end of the world\"). it also spends a lot of too much time talking about it rather than actually providing any insights, either on on the causes or continuing to stagnate the pacing for the main storyline. As such, the film lasts longer than it should have.\n\ngordon gekko betrayal is a little over the top. also the subsequent breakup, or when they're getting clothes for him and all he does is talk on the phone.\n\ncrappy conclusion, rumors are dumb and dumb imagery with the beheading",

The aftermath of the sirens for example is one of the most hilarious moments in the film. \"We gotta find some.. wizard to change him back\"\n\nI love the use of music to keep the harmonious atmosphere.\n\nSuper cheesy ending, but the lighthearted comedic tone of the series is appropriate with it.",

    "review": "It's an interesting choice: an emphasis on wording with minimal set pieces inspired by play acting and black and white. Tries to appeal to the more raw Shakespeare sensibilities. Cinematography with lighting is excellent.\n\nThis is an intensive movie. As it's real-time, it's very hard to understand the script unless you parse the text carefully or are recently familiar with the scenes beforehand. It's due to a combination of archaic English and poetry. I felt scenes were much more enjoyable to watch after rewatching them as certain lines are too dense. I had to pay a significant amount of attention at each line to make sure I understood its intent.",
