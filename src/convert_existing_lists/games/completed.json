    "comments": "Forgotten City is an excellent story-intensive mystery.\n\n__Story.__ The writing is excellent, both in how it introduces tiny mysteries in its overall story and in its rich characters each with their own personality. The lore in weaving in Roman, Greek, and Egyptian mythology surprisingly works.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Forgotten City's main innovation is time travel mechanic. It works well in terms of both the gameplay, where you can pick up items such as gold too accumulate wealth or steal an item that can be used to cure someone later on, and the story. It also makes \"failure point\" significantly more generous as you can always redo conversations if you permanently worsen someone's mood in a given cycle. Dialogue is more flexible in being branching with story consequences as it's a short cycle to relive new ones. It's such an interesting idea to make dialogue carry interesting gameplay---in contrary to, for example, the skill check systems in Fallout New Vegas and Disco Elysium.\n\nLevel design is excellent. It feels realistic in just sprawling the routes are across horizontal and vertical axes.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Decent graphics, standard for a low-budget indie game. Visuals are overly polished. Mostly talking heads. The voice acting is decent though.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ After completing some objectives, you can simply talk to Galerius so you don't have to redo various quest completions to alter the current time cycle.\n+ Narrated scripts continue like an audio log so you can continue navigating while listening to them.\n+ No quest was difficult to complete. I found pretty much everything by myself simply through exploration. There was the occasional difficulty in finding a certain NPC or a door given that the waypoint markers aren't consistently added.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ The light combat mechanics. I didn't find them take much away from the experience. It's clearly a part of its Skyrim roots.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Quicksave creates a new save file, and there is no rotating buffer of a finite set of quicksaves. This means quicksaving just adds a massive amount of saves over time that you have to manually delete.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI played as Architect as it provides the most lore.",

    "comments": "Disco Elysium is a true spiritual successor to Planescape Torment. Its story, characters, and pacing reign among the best in video games, and the RPG mechanics including its skill check system make the storytelling feel not just interactive but personal.\n\n__Story.__ The prose is surprisingly good for a video game. It builds atmosphere so well from every dialogue, and it knows how to do world-building including history, characters, factions, and political ideologies. I also like the 24 parts of the brain as the approach to display inner discourse. The passive skill check system works so well to not only give a sense of different builds but also the conversations among those skills to make your character feel unique.\n\nCharacters themselves are strong. Harry's mysteries such as in his dreams and alcoholism are motivated well.\n\nThere can be a lot of exposition dumps at times as the approach to world-building, especially in the beginning. Not unexpected for a script-heavy RPG I suppose. It's not nearly as bad as Planescape Torment however, which would serve you multiple large paragraphs at a time. The voice narration and animation also help with this in serving emotion beyond just the text.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The game is inspired by CRPGs, notably Planescape Torment, and it shows. It's a point-and-click with dialogue options and skill checks, building on the core of what made CRPGs' world-building and dialogue so deep. Unlike Planescape Torment, Disco Elysium builds on its strengths by focusing entirely on the script with dialogue and environment interaction, removing all combat elements. It still benefits from the RPG elements of attributes, items, and skill checks with their randomness.\n\nIt's an innovative skill check mechanic where you can try \"white\" skill checks again whenever you level up the skill or uncover new information. This helps with the indecision of knowing what skill to level up as well as revisiting NPC dialogues to progress. Many skill checks are also passive, making checks rarely feel like you've missed out on content due to insufficient skill allocation. \"Red\" checks are significant with a single try but are often set up with failure in mind (as is the character overall); so it doesn't feel wasted if you fail.\n\nQuest design is fantastic. There are many tasks (quests), and with no explicit markers in good old-fashioned RPG style. \"Secret task\" completion rewards you with additional XP and never feels obligatory to seek out. I greatly like this approach to quest design as it's closer to a task list than a distinct set of game-y video game objectives to complete on a quest-by-quest basis.\n\nProgression-wise, there is XP to level up skills, coins to purchase items, thought cabinet, political alignment to change dialogue options and thoughts. I also like that the idea that you have companions but you don't have to deal with their own stats like a video game: it's all about you while still benefiting from a companion for dialogue.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The art exudes style, evoking atmosphere from its UI, character and environment art, and soundtrack. It's fully voiced and voiced well. I felt fully immersed in the game, playing hours on end not only due to the story's pacing but also the excellent voice acting.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Time mechanic. It adds to the immersion and a lingering sense of urgency. On the other hand, it's non-obvious who's still up to continue talking to indefinitely without passing to the next day.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Run isn't default. Fortunately, you can double-click to run instead of walk, as opposed to relying on Shift key.\n+ Fairly long loading screens and too many.\n+ The list of white checks does not remove checks that are no longer available. You also can't scroll through it with your mouse.\n+ When you can fast travel is inconsistent. Just let us always be able to fast travel.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Drunken Detective's Handbook](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1948691016)\n+ [Thought Cabinet](https://discoelysium.fandom.com/wiki/Thought_Cabinet)\n+ [PSA: Drugs enable you to permanently raise caps](https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/dlo2mv/psa_drugs_enable_you_to_permanently_raise_skill)\n\nI played the Final Cut edition.\n\nMy build was 4/4/2/2 with Shivers as my Signature Skill. I generally liked the idea of a technically and emotionally intelligent person while still with minimum capacity for physique and motorics. I never really sold items. Outside of the three XP-related thoughts, I did not seek out others but [gravitated to +stat ones](https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/ebiglv/so_what_are_your_12_favorite_thoughts_spoilers); I pursued the same strategy for clothes. I generally only used skill points to reattempt white checks, but I drifted toward Conceptualization and Encyclopedia (for XP); Empathy, Logic, Rhetoric, Inland Empire, Perception, Visual Calculus, Shivers, Half-Light, Composure; and stopping at a max of 8. By endgame, I was close to effectively maxxing out all stats. This means mid-to-late game is similar with all builds; an alcoholic physique/motorics build could do well in a future playthrough to experience the passive skill checks in early game.",

    "date_started": "12/20/21",
    "date_finished": "12/27/21",
    "comments": "Persona 4 provides several refinements to Persona 3, improving its overall experience. I greatly enjoy Persona 4's overall gameplay loop, with managing a schedule to level up Status Parameters (including studying and jobs), level up Social Links (progressing character stories), dungeon crawling (with its own combat-based progression), and progressing the main story. I most enjoy the visual novel elements in boosting social stats and managing the social link schedule.\n\nFlaw-wise, Persona 4 suffers from the usual Persona issues of bland level design and side quests. I also dislike how difficult it is to maximize all Social Ranks (see all content) in a single playthrough as a second playthrough is too redundant with little replayability.\n\n__Story.__ The rural setting is a nice change of pace from Persona 3's urban environment. The story is fairly trite and follows the same formula as Persona 3 as well. I enjoyed most of the characters. I also greatly like that the main story is not nearly as dramatic in cosmic scale; it's a town murder, which keeps it more narrow and fleshed-out not unlike Jojo Part 4, and it's less melodramatic in dark themes and vague symbology.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Like Persona 3, Persona 2 is half visual novel, half JRPG-based dungeon crawling.\n\nThe core battle system is the same as Persona 3: exploiting enemy weaknesses, carrying a diverse moveset among your party composition with elemental attacks (Agi, Bufu, Zio, Garu), a party heal (Cadenza or Media), and in later game, defense debuffs and attack buffs (Rakunda, Tarukaja). Applying weaknesses stuns them (1 More) and enables a party All-Out attack. You also wander in dungeons, able to dodge enemies and attack enemies from behind to launch a preemptive attack.\n\nProgression system follows typical JRPG elements with skills, items, equipment, and with stats. Battle rewards are improved with Shuffle Time rewarding items or Personas, and additional cards that let you obtain multiple. Like Persona 3, only the main character can change Personas, which streamlines choices and keeps characters tied to their elemental/defensive playstyles. New is Fusion Forecast.\n\nNew to Persona 4 are some online features. I like the Persona Search function, which uses online capabilities to determine popular Personas to fuse as a default choice. it's a good alternative option than selecting based on specific Persona combinations, where instead of deciding based on Personas you want to lose, you decide based on Personas you want to gain. Rescue Requests also add a bit more dynamism to battles. Similarly, you can see what other folks did on that day.\n\nIn terms of the visual novel elements, Social Links remain as the staple. New to Persona 4, upgrading party member Social Links also improves combat abilities, including spontaneous combos, status ailment and down cures. New activities include jobs to improve certain Status Parameters; maintaining a garden; reading books; riding your scooter; bug catching and fishing.\n\nLike Persona 3, level design is quite weak. Dungeons are empty mazes.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Voice acting is excellent, as if it were a real anime. The soundtrack is decent.As a setting change, I like that Persona 4's dungeons isn't one redundant ladder climb but the dungeons themselves change depending on the theme. The anime cutscenes are also nice.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ You can change tactics to manually control your party members. I hated having to use a mod for this in Persona 3's PS2 edition. Having tactics in general is nice becaues you can have them automate when you're just grinding mindlessly.\n+ The sub-menu is such a nice quality of life to instantly go to different areas. Similarly, there are fewer small areas to navigate, e.g., NPC shops immediately trigger their menus instead of having to walk up to them.\n+ You can customize difficulty settings in the game (PC port), greatly reducing the need for grind by upping XP/money while keeping enemy damage/HP the same of a certain preset difficulty.\n+ You can skip through dialogue and cutscenes. This is especially helpful if you died during a long day.\n+ As quality of life, Persona 4 Golden adds settings to give more EXP won, money won, and retry in battles.\n+ All new Personas are automatically registered. This means you only have to manually register when you want to overwrite an existing one.\n+ Early game, I enjoyed that I had to actually stock up on HP/MP Potions, Retreats, and Revival Beads in order to complete a dungeon in 1 day. Fortunately, the game also gives you plenty cash to stock up.\n+ Like Persona 3, the Analysis option in battle keeps track of enemy resistances/weaknesses you've tried. No need to memorize.\n+ The TV show programs including shopping add an additional world-building element.\n+ Persona 4 Golden offers third-tier Personas with an extra skill. They are effectively an upgrade as a Rank 11 Social Link encounter among your party members.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Your character no longer gets tired, so there's no incentive to waste an Evening sleeping. This means it's also easier to complete a dungeon in one day.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ There's not as many missables (e.g., most of Persona 3's sidequests) but there are still quite a few, e.g., books if you chose basketball. There's also a specific subset of Social Links with earlier than typical deadlines: Nanako (Oct 31), Adachi (Nov 1), Dojima (Nov 3), Marie (December 31). The overall deadline of February 5 for Social Links is also arbitrary.\n+ Like Persona 3, sidequests remain as boring fetch quests with no story. Worse, they now require backtracking to previous dungeons. It's better if they don't exist in the game.\n+ Finding clues for the next dungeon is annoying without a walkthrough. You literally have to talk to every NPC.\n+ Skills don't distinguish between active and passive. I discarded Boost skills for a while because I thought they were active, but they're actually huge DPS increases!\n+ Fuck Hollow Forest. Its gameplay---while new in encouraging patterns like less item reliance---is too annoying in practice to actually play because its SP penalty disincentives you from actually fighting enemies. Furthermore, like Marie, its story is largely tacked on and not very interesting compared to the rest of the plot.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Social Links Guide](https://sites.google.com/site/persona4goldenguide/social-links)\n+ [School Answers](https://sites.google.com/site/persona4goldenguide/everything-else/school-answers)\n+ [Books](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/vita/641695-persona-4-golden/faqs/65714)\n+ [Boxed Lunches](https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/9852-persona-4-golden-boxed-lunches-how-to-make-every-perfect-lunch-for-the-cooking-with-gas-achievement)\n\nI played Persona 4 Golden on PC. I played on Normal difficulty as I enjoy the visual novel elements more than the combat; and the extent to which I enjoy the combat, it's when it's least grindy.\n\nI played blind with the exception of guides for Social Links; school answers; and books. Club-wise, I went with Basketball and Drama; for romance, I chose Rise. My strategy is to level everything equally---Social Ranks, party levels, Persona levels---but I prioritize Status Parameters before Social Ranks due to exams (Knowledge) and dialogue choices (Courage, Understanding), anyone who approaches you as it guarantees a level up (especially higher levels as various scripted events automatically boost Social Link points), and Nanako/Adachi/Dojima/Marie due to stricter deadlines. I complete dungeons in one day and as early as possible. I didn't care for quest completion nor bonus bosses. By the end of the game (True Ending), I maxed all Status Parameters and Social Links with the exception of Naoki, Ai, Yumi, Shu (rank 9), Fox (rank 8), and Eri (rank 5).",

    "comments": "Planescape Torment is like an interactive novel. Its strength is clearly in its writing and as you explore the world and interact with characters and complete quests. Combat and menus do not age well, and neither do the audiovisuals. The game can also get bogged down by exposition dumps and unintuitive quest progression requiring a walkthrough.\n\n__Story.__ The story is mature: it's a personal journey of an immortal trying to regain his memories through repeated attempts. The dialogue options and depth of its themes are fun. It stands out most in its worldbuilding with deep lore in the setting, factions, and residents and their social status within the cities.\n\nDialogue consists of large info dumps during exposition. That does not age well.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Planescape Torment introduced the idea of dialogue-heavy RPGs, with stats and even attaining XP through dialogue.\n\nCombat is tedious click and waiting. RTWP system works reasonably well here given that combat isn't much of a large focus, and it's necessary for controlling the many menus to perform timely spellcasting. Making all combat turn-based would be even more tedious.\n\nControls are clunky and feel annoying traversing the world. My closest prior experience is with RTS games like Starcraft where you must control the camera, the selected units, and mouse control where they move/attack/apply special abilities.\n\nLimited inventory slots across party members and inventory weight. Further, you can only sell certain item types to certain vendors, and their value degrades if you sell multiple. There's no main stash, so you put them in places you can remember (e.g., containers in Marketplace near vendors).\n\nProgression system inherits from D&D with attributes, alignment, equipment, inventory space, mage and priest spell books and spell memory.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Graphics and audio is much like Baldurâs Gate as the engine is the same. Partially voiced, which is surprising that there's even any voiced dialogue for a game in 1999 to be honest.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Quests have no quest/waypoint markers. I love the good old days of actually having to read quest descriptions.\n+ Save files work across platforms like Windows, Mac, and iPad.\n+ Quicksave cycles among 4 slots instead of just 1 slot.\n+ You can change both factions and classes at any time and without consequence, progressing in XP/requirements for each.\n+ Once you get to Lower Ward, you unlock fast travel.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ The small fog of war and view distance. Possibly an engine limitation?\n+ You can only join one faction at a time. Leaving a faction to join another has no penalties.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Many of the formulaic named NPCs have generic dialogue. Sometimes though they actually have unique dialogue. This makes it a somewhat tedious affair if you want to experience the unique content in the game as you must talk to everyone.\n+ You drop all your inventory items when you die. Very tedious, so it's preferable to just savescum.\n+ Can't use function layer for keybinds, e.g., F5/F9 for quicksave/load.\n+ Quest items are carried like any other item in the inventory. You can accidentally delete or sell it. It's not clear what are quest items, especially items you want to carry for future quests.\n+ Unlike Bethesda-style speech checks, there's no indicator of which dialog options are made available through stat thresholds, or dialog options not available because of the lack thereof.\n+ There's a large collection of equipment slots for each character, but they're not all available. It's better design to just omit the slot for each character, e.g., only display tattoo, accessory, and organ slots for TNO.\n+ While I like that PT doesn't provide prescriptive quest objectives, it should at least tell me when I completed the quest and that I should head back to the questgiver for a reward.\n+ Object descriptions to click on. A relic from D&D that's more a nuisance to mindfully click and read each time rather than taking in its detail visually.\n+ The THAC0/AC system is poorly explained. For example, you want lower both but [items like rings indicate +THAC0/AC even though it decreases.](https://www.reddit.com/r/planescape/comments/mly9en/can_someone_tell_me_how_ac_and_thac0_work_in_this/gto5frs).\n+ I almost bricked my save by collecting all the Handkerchiefs then selling them. You need one to progress to Ravel.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Dan Simpson's guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/187975-planescape-torment/faqs/7964). It's the best one as he's known for Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and PS:T guides. But it's plaintext which I despise to play video games with as your enjoyment is largely stalled and dependent on following paragraphs of text. I used the guide for the initial setup.\n+ [Quests](http://shrines.rpgclassics.com/pc/planescape/quests.shtml)\n+ [Attributes wiki](https://torment.fandom.com/wiki/Attributes). Helps for planning stats when leveling. It's also a good reference for extra stats. The highest stat checks are [24 WIS, 21 INT, 25 CHA](https://www.reddit.com/r/planescape/comments/abcq9t/going_full_mage_tips_and_advises_are_welcome).\n\nI played the Enhanced Edition with its quality-of-life changes such as quickloot, tab-highlighting, heal on rest, max HP on level up, and always run. I rebinded keys so WASD allows me to control my camera, 1 as multiselect all, 2 as Nameless One, Q on Attack.\n\nI initially played on 09/03/17 on my iPad. I only made 2-3 hours progress. I restarted on 6/7/19 but gave up again. I played again on PC, on normal difficulty.\n\nI played mostly blind, enjoying the immersion---spoiler-free and without pacing issues when following a walkthrough line-by-line. I played a mage, focusing on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as they enable the most dialogue options and minimize the necessity of combat. I played Lawful Good as it allowed me to help random NPCs to complete sidequests and not arbitrarily kill off NPCs. Early game, I prioritized (with levels and tattoos) 18 INT / 19 WIS to benefit from Dak'kon's Unbroken Circle of Zerthimon XP and spell boosts, then 16 CHA. For Annah, I prioritized 100 Pickpocket, 100 Detect and Disarm Traps.",

    "comments": "Writing is great. Graphics are wonderfully colorful. Like Peril on Gorgon, Eridanos has a promising start with its investigation but it's all too linear. I greatly prefer the multiple approaches that an immersive sim/emergent gameplay offers, c.f., Beyond the Beef. Here, you just complete a choice of 3 quests simultaneously, and it's obviously ruled out which suspects have a solid alibi. The twin sister plot twist is also just dumb. I'd much prefer an actual mystery solve where you actually investigate the murder instead of just ruling out everyone else.\n\nMiscellaneous things I enjoyed:\n\n+ The conversation with the Bellhop, and the overall premise of investigating a high-profile murder.\n+ Discrepancy Amplifier as a clue finder. I also like that it pings you when you enter an area that requires investigation. That way you don't have to spam using it.\n+ The woman with the slug in her neck.\n+ New factions.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nTo quicken the pace, I tried to RP as an actual investigator in the real story. So no dilly-dallying too much such as investigating corners of the map, looking at the map screen, or looting every single item I find. This greatly improved the flow and my overall fun even though I didn't inspect all the content necessarily (the mystery of some unexplored rooms added to my enjoyment as I'm sure knowing that they're empty would be even more boring).\n\nI played on Story (Easy) difficulty as I got bored of the gameplay during Peril on Gorgon; it's just shoot heads.",

It's like a standalone episode in a franchise, not unlike the Fallout DLCs. It's a well-written intrigue with a family to redeem itself as a mysterious heiress and retracing the footsteps of a previous mercenary.\n\nThe threefold labs to explore gets video gamey, and while I like that the end mission provides a choice, but it's too clear-cut of a solution much like Outer Worlds' main faction choices. There's an obviously evil solution and the writing should have given better justification. Combat remains mediocre as well as itemization and a too easy difficulty.\n\nMiscellaneous things that I enjoyed:\n\n+ Freddie vs Trixie.\n+ Businesses in Halycon officially owned by sprats for any legal recourse.\n+ Audio logs.

    "comments": "Outer Worlds is designed like a spiritual successor to Fallout New Vegas while also borrowing elements from Bioware games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age. It doesn't quite reach those heights. But it does retain high-quality writing, main and side quests, and RPG progression mehanics to provide a great Fallout-like experience. Its art style is also nice.\n\nUnfortunately, combat is mediocre. Difficulty is too easy. And it suffers from limited exploration, worldbuilding, and diegetic storytelling due to its semi-open world design.\n\n__Story.__ The writing is impressive. I enjoy the corporate politics satire: having worked in one, I can appreciate its emphasis on efficiency, corporate middlemen and bureaucracy, and the culture/responsibilities individuals feel. It's clearly a universe where companies have too much power, effectively at the level of governments: they're able to overwork their workers, redact what would otherwise be universal rights such as contracted servitude, and commit crimes like the Plague without accountability.\n\nThe sidequests are also all on par with Oblivion. I love the acting sidequest, Retirement, The Secret People, Foundation.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The core system is much like Fallout's, and it plays to Oblivions strengths in RPGs. The quests are all excellent, including side quests with sufficient objective variety going further than the rote fetch, escort, or slay. They also feature optional objectives with multiple ways to approach it. Choices, and at least the illusion of choice, are strong.\n\nCombat is mediocre, feeling like only a slight upgrade to Fallout New Vegas. It is largely a point and shoot with forgettable encounters, enemy AI, and enemy variety.\n\nIn terms of level design, Outer Worlds adopts a semi-linear design not unlike Bioware games such as Mass Effect and Dragon Age. It is distinctively not open world and there's little incentive to explore in the open areas that do exist. I can no longer wander in a random direction and stumble onto events or acquire new items. The craft of diegetic storytelling is forgotten. Space exploration with discrete worlds also makes for a noncontiguous design, making the world feel less open. Town houses are also sectioned off so you can't explore to pilfer a random NPC's place.\n\nBuild variety includes stealth, dialog/pacifist, sniper vs gunslinger with small guns vs melee, energy vs physical vs other weapon types. Like Fallout's build options, there are attributes, skills, and perks, and with the staple of attribute/skill/perk options. There are 18 Specialized Skills grouped into 7 Core Skills that you can level up.\n\nOn miscellaneous mechanics:\n\n+ Outer Worlds brings back the speech checks from Fallout New Vegas which Fallout 4 removed, and keeping it as deterministic instead of a roll. Workbench also enables modding and repairing. These systems are great.\n+ VATS is replaced with tactical time dilation. This keeps the game better paced than the turn-like-order of VATS, and with weak spot damage. TTD is excellent as a more dynamic rendition of VATS. With that said, weak spots aren't obvious and there's little incentive to shoot any body part aside from the head.\n+ Stealth has seen several improvements since Fallout/Elder Scrolls. For example, there are enemy awareness indicators and bushes.\n+ There is a larger emphasis on repairing items as their condition affects their efficiency. This encourages you to repair at vendor or to break down items in order to use your weapon/armor parts.\n+ Unlike Bethesda games, you carry 2 companions at a time which enables camradarie chat not unlike Mass Effect and Dragon Age.\n+ The lack of difficulty outside the beginning area removes the need of many mechanics. You never run out of ammo, Adreno consumables, or picks; food is plentiful yet useless; and there's little need to spend Bits; companion abilities are useless given their animation already takes as long as a typical fight.\n+ Item variety is fairly lacking. The weapons aren't all that interesting and don't have much variety: all weapons in an area are static and you'll see dozens of any one.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Detail is quite good, certainly above average for 2019 and among titles like Horizon Zero Dawn and God of War. Motion capture animations look great during cutscenes but lip sync is off. Dialog scenes are also just talking heads. Voice acting is good.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Like more modern RPGs, you can flag items as junk. That way you don't have to reexamine all your items before you sell them.\n+ You can see all quests on your map, including active quests. I wish the default displays inactive quests though.\n+ Quicksave doesn't overwrite the same slot, so you can go back to previous quicksaves, and it's cycled among 4 slots.\n+ You can holster your weapon.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ I like the animations and idea behind Companion Abilities. It's a shame they're not integrated better into the gameplay with more unique abilities or incentives to use them.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ There's a number of streamlined elements. No waiting/resting-based mechanic with NPCs performing a day rotation. No lockpicking or hacking minigame. Armors have negligible type differences and only feature armor and helmet. There's no real change to maximizing faction reputation or companion quests (e.g., Dragon Age's companion bonuses that are significant). No jail or lose item system when you're caught stealing. No romance.\n+ On both the Edgewater and Monarch, you're given a choice of morally grey choices. But one of the solutions is a compromise that feels like the \"right solution\". They should do away with that option altogether to challenge you to a true decision.\n+ The Dash/Dodge ability sucks. Why even bind it as a jump dodge instead of a separate keybind? The game combat also just isn't Dark Souls-style where you enemy attacks are well-telegraphed and necessitate dodge.\n+ There's no disadvantage to equipping full heavy armor on your companions. This ruins their aesthetic.\n+ There aren't options to stealth kill until later in the game such as when you equip a sniper (any high damage per shot weapon) with a Quiet Muzzler---earliest with the Hunting Rifle Ultra if you can find it.\n+ Corpses can be hard to find sometimes because they're not easily glowable, particularly from a larger distance. This makes Plasma weapons especially annoying as they turn enemies to ash.\n+ Without Science 100, tinkering to level up a low level weapon has exponentially high costs. Tinker costs should be based on weapon level, not how many times it's been tinkered.\n+ Quest markers. I prefer Morrowind's approach of forcing you to read the quest lines to know where to go next. This makes you more immersed in the quest itself rather than going from point A to B. Similarly, having to go through the notes to get the keycode, not have it automatically written.\n+ The use of both waypoint markers and a compass HUD is redundant.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nThis entry does not include the DLCs. I played Hard difficulty. I played blind.\n\n__Build.__ Like my Fallout playthroughs, I played a stealth sniper build ([1](https://www.neoseeker.com/the-outer-worlds/guides/Stealth_Sniper_Guide), [2](https://fextralife.com/the-outer-worlds-builds-time-sniper), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/dw0p10/outer_worlds_sniper_build_guide_with_and_without)). It's derived from the legacy that Bethesda RPGs have bad combat, and therefore it's often better exploiting first encounter damage and from long range. It focuses on 100 Long Guns, 100 Sneak, 100 Science, 60 Inspiration, and rest into Dialog. I primarily use companions for boosts to dialog skills (at max level 36 with Lockpick/Hack helms and +5-15 Dialog armor, Parvati/Max boost my Persuade/Intimidate/Hack to the 105 threshold and Lockpick to the 100 threshold). My main gear is [Dead-Eye Assault Rifle 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/dybmx6/sublight_sniper_rifle_vs_dead_eye_assault_rifle_2) with [Shock](https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/dqmkve/a_damage_chart_for_snipers), Sublight VP Armor, and Cell Stability Mono-Lens. For aptitude, I went +1 Persuasion.",

I like the focus on an additional character, particularly from the covenant side in order to provide a new perspective.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Largely the same with a few changes: removal of health bar entirely (hence even more casual); new weapons like the Battle Rifle and Plasma Sword; rocket launcher can lock-on; you can dual wield (although its not good due to no grenade); you can hijack enemy vehicles. While the Battle Rifle made the old Assault Rifle finally useful, the SMG, Pistol, Shotgun, and Sentinel Beam are all too weak; and the Needler remains weak.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The remastered is especially impressive. It's most notable in cutscenes remade with new CGI animations using motion capture. There's significantly more work done to remaster Halo 2 for Anniversary than Halo Combat Evolved.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Halo 2's shotgun is terrible. Compared to Halo 1's, you have to get significantly closer to kill a grunt and you can't one-shot an elite. Similarly, the Pistol got significantly nerfed.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI replayed the game in November 2021. I played on Heroic difficulty. My preferred weapons are Plasma Pistol, Battle Rifle/Covenant Carbine, Sniper Rifle/Beam Rifle, Rocket Launcher/Fuel Rod Cannon, and Energy Sword. I almost always keep a Plasma Pistol for elites, dropping in later levels when the main enemy type is Flood or Brutes.\n\nI replayed it on November 2021 but dropped it in the middle of the covenant campaign.",

It's an excellent linear campaign with worldbuilding, open level set pieces, defining aesthetics with new technology at the time, great weapons, enemy design, nd vehicles. It does away with Half-Life's puzzle and exploration elements to keep the campaign largely action-filled through the journey.\n\nFlaw-wise, certain levels can be all too frustrating in poor design. Levels also see a lot of copy-paste area reusage.\n\n__Story.__ Fairly standard but I enjoy the large lore in its military scifi setting.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The shooting still feels great in 2021, with excellent weapon variety, enemy variety, and level design. Halo unfortunately set the trend on regenerative health, but in this game, it actually works. The two-weapon slot limit also works well. There are so many iconic weapons here: pistol, plasma pistol, sniper rifle, shotgun, rocket launcher, sticky grenade. The \"noob combo\" of a plasma pistol + precision weapon, along with ample grenades for AoE, is especially satisfying.\n\nI greatly dislike Halo's limited ammo with the need to constantly swap weapons as you progress through a level. This would be greatly streamlined if the Covenant weapons at least restocked on battery as you ran over corpses instead of constantly having to search for a new one.\n\nSome levels are to brutally difficult due to lack of cover, too many enemies, and lack of ammo. Library and Assault on the Control Room in particular. Assault on the Control Room is also unnecessarily long and has too much level duplication.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The soundtrack stands the test of time. Animations and lighting are particularly good for its 2001 release. I enjoy the additional detail in the remastered, particularly during cutscenes. However, it also ruins the atmosphere with unnecessary detail and lighting at times: there are even remastered assets that don't align with the original's geomtry, so you'd shoot behind an object for cover but you hit an invisible wall.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ When you swap for a weapon of the same type, you can only pick up ones with higher battery than your current weapon.\n+ There's plenty of grenades. It's effectively as frequent as ammo.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ You zoom out if you get shot.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Shooting from cover in Remastered is unreliable because the asset sizes aren't always aligned with the original's.\n+ The Remastered graphics doesn't make it as easy to tell if you're shooting the shield or HP of an elite.\n+ No coop matchmaking. The coop FPS campaign seems like a great opportunity to play with randoms and have a good time. Similar to Resident Evil 5.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI replayed the game on November 2021, largely due to Halo Infinite hype, so I could catch up from previous games. It's the first time I played the game from start to finish. I played the Master Chief Collection. I played on Heroic difficulty. Following meta, I generally used Plasma Pistol, Pistol, Shotgun, Sniper Rifle, and Rocket Launcher.

Playing in November 2021 (only a few months after Aftermath's release), matchmaking feels dead; there are only 1-2K players on Steam and I rarely find a game with 4 human players playing Easy or Normal difficulty.\n\n__Gameplay.__ World War Z is a horde shooter introducing classes with perks and cosmetics through characters and weapon skins. It uses a level design of interconnected areas with defense against swarms, where you pick up heavy items and equipment to prepare yourself. The game is clearly designed with set pieces in mind. Stealth is poorly designed as it's unintuitive when an area can be stealthed. Specials are forgettable.\n\nPlaying a third-person game with first-person view is always a little different than a native first-person game.

It's a mystery set for you to learn more as well as what and why things are happening in the tabletop adventure itself.\n\nThe story reveal after you beat the game once (Act 1) is excellent. I love how it continues to edge onto its experimental horror by then going VHS + found footage.\n\n__Gameplay.__ There are a lot of interesting ideas to the usual card based roguelike. Overkill damage to enemies and player health. HP system is based on a scale where you must do a relative amount of 5 more than your opponent. A card game largely based on sacrifices, using cards on the field (not unlike Yugioh) as well as those destroyed followed later in the game with other ideas: energy cost system like Magic the Gathering, gem system, and skulls system. A fairly small deck but also comprised with a draw option for the lowest minion. The enemy can surrender.\n\nThe card arena is effectively asymmetrical, with the enemy able to have a second row while you can only defend as it demonstrates enemy intent.\n\nThe events during the roguelike scenario are quite innovative. In one, you can merge two of the same cards to combine their stats. In another, you obtain pelts from a currency of overkill damage, the cards of which are useful defense, and you then sell them to another trader.\n\nThe three Acts are substantially different across gameplay, story, and aesthetic.\n\n1. Arguably the most fun part of Inscryption's gameplay is that on top of its excellent core card roguelike mechanics, it has an interesting mystery where you slowly understood the game's mechanics and unlock solutions to the puzzles to progress to the next Act. It's hard to not look up what to do next, but the game does provide sufficient hints and it's all the much more engaging as you arrive at the solution yourself. Eventually over future playthroughs you unlock enough upgrades to make subsequent journies easier: that is, not just through improved game knowledge but also better initial cards, items, and other mechanics (e.g., your own card, an extra candle, ability to reroll).\n2. Act 2 proceeds as a conventional card RPG with deck building and rewards as you defeat enemies. It's not as dynamic as Act 1's roguelike where you can modify a card's mechanics, but it's still fun for its deckbuilding aspect and new decks.\n3. Act 3 goes back to Act 1's more modern 3D indie graphics but delves further in the story adds ideas with the robot deck's mechanics. Exploration is now gridlike, and death involves Dark Souls corpse run instead of a full roguelike reset. Bounty hunters offer a challenge if you keep winning battles. Gems mechanic. While I enjoyed the open world exploration in Act 3, I greatly preferred Act 1's card mechanics over Act 3's energy system, which is overplayed in card games. It's much more passive than Act 1's blood sacrifice and bones resources. Act 2 and 3's death penalty just isn't as harsh and replayable as Act 1's roguelike structure. It's also unfortunate the ending doesn't really explain much.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ I love the indie horror aesthetic. Atmospheric music, gritty dialogue, and a blocky texture. The tabletop layout for Act 1's card game is cute.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ You get to create a card for the next playthrough. Nice way of adding some boost based on your previous deck but not in such a way that it's overpowered.\n+ The scariness and meta that the game uses the size and age of your files. And it creates cards even from your Steam friends.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ You can't always look at your deck. This is annoying when you make decisions like card choices.",

    "date_started": "10/23/21",
    "date_finished": "10/31/21",
    "comments": "Payday 2 is a unique class-based PvE shooter with objectives, which is one of my favorite game subgenres. It adds a lot of interesting ideas to the mix including its setting, ranged hitscan enemies, enemy variety, level and objective variety, build variety (along with new mechanics like armor vs dodge), and many difficulty settings. These all add to give the game a significant amount of replayability.\n\nFlaw-wise:\n\n+ There is too much waiting in the game. You achieve a lot of objectives by simply waiting in a room for a drill, a helicopter/boat to come back, or more information. In Overkill, you can literally just AFK for minutes on end and not hinder any progress.\n+ The game is defense-heavy not unlike Killing Floor 2. I greatly prefer Left 4 Dead and Back 4 Blood's approach of dynamically moving through a level rather than staying in static areas. The occasional horde spawn forces moving into a defense position, but it's the movement across a level that makes this interesting as the defense is not always in the same location. There are only a handful of such heists in Payday 2.\n+ Balance across both builds and difficulties. Shotguns, LMGs, and akimbo style reign supreme. There's less need for sniper rifles as many weapons already work so well against specials like Dozers, and higher difficulties are primarily about crowd control rather than prioritizing specials. Similarly, LMGs suck. Payday 2's specials just aren't as threatening as they are in games like Left 4 Dead 2.\n+ Stealth as a tactical option feels largely tacked on and unreliable. Loud is the better designed playstyle.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Payday 2 is basically a defense game, like Killing Floor 2 where you defend against waves of mobs and special enemies, but also where you complete objectives. There's casing mode, then the tactical option of combat or stealth, then escaping. This core gameplay loop greatly benefits from enemy variety; level variety with 66 unique maps as of 2016; objectives with huge variety including bank heists, chase sequences, escort missions, cooking meth, driving, and multi-day jobs; and additional game modes such as Crime Spree and side jobs. All this adds to a high degree of replayability. Heck, it took me 30 hours just to go through Career Mode which plays through all levels once and excludes roughly 10 heists, holdouts, and crime sprees. It'll take significantly longer to play through each level multiple times in order to master their routes, sometimes with differing objectives, and at the highest difficulties.\n\nPlaying Payday 2 in 2021, it's certainly a unique defense game. At the base Overkill difficulty, you largely ignore enemies who do poke damage and only need to kill specials and enemies in your way. The common mobs are also ranged hitscan as opposed to your typical melee zombie. Mechanics like armor vs dodge and a focus on weapons balancing for ammo pickup rate are unique.\n\nThere's significant build variety including a choice of weapon/damage style (such as assault rifle, SMG, shotgun, sniper, melee, pistols, akimbo style), defense (armor, dodge), and enabling other playstyles (stealth, technician which is objective and utility-focused including C4 vs Saw). There are a lot of choices here that can make each playstyle slightly different: armor, weapons, throwables, deployables, skill tree, perk decks.\n\nProgression system with cosmetics, weapons to purchase alongside weapon slots and attachments, skill tree, perk deck, and safehouse. Grind currencies include XP, cash, and continental coins (for safehouse upgrades). Infamy system effectively allows for an infinite prestige, tracking your total XP. With the Infamy 3.0 system, only Infamy Rank 1 has a gameplay effect and the rest are for cosmetics and bragging rights.\n\nDifficulty options provide 7 grades. Normal, Hard, and Very Hard are for casual playthroughs. Overkill is the most popular for general play, and Mayhem, Deathwish, and Death Sentence are for challenges requiring more knowledge of the meta.\n\nI like that the objective mechanics encourage teamwork. For example, moving bags, doing one thing in two different locations, or jobs that benefit from a certain build whether it be C4/Saw, faster drills, or additional manpower to find mission items like keys and keycards.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The graphics are still reasonably good playing the game in 2021 although you can see its age. The game certainly benefits from its huge amount of cosmetic items such as characters, masks, armor skins, and weapon skins.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Mod support, including an active modding community.\n+ You can turn off the music so you can just play your own Spotify playlist (or with effort, put custom music in the game itself). It's a good way of listening to new albums while playing a video game.\n+ Heat system encourages playing a variety of levels. It boosts XP on levels you haven't played recently and decreases XP rate on levels you've played recently. This is indicated by +% or -% when selecting a heist on Crime.net.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ The tutorial is bad. There are so many mechanics not explained, including weapon stats, ammo pickup, enemy pinging, the playstyles of armor vs dodge vs regen, focusing on headshots, what enemies to prioritize vs ignore, where [exactly to saw](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=213666332), the [basics of stealth](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=198446139), how to find Gage packages.\n+ No ability to ping interesting locations, items, etc. You can at least ping special enemies.\n+ Host kick is too powerful. Hosts can be assholes and kick you right before a mission ends, and you get no rewards effectively wasting the past 20 minutes.\n+ The game pauses whenever someone joins. This ruins immersion.\n+ No way to tell how many downs you have left.\n+ No ability to set the default of lasers or fire mode. You have to turn lasers on for example at the start of every game.\n+ No stats at the end of a game displaying kills, deaths, etc.\n+ Joker AI is bad at pathing to follow you.\n+ You can't see if your converted companion is still alive or if it's a teammate's.\n+ The matchmaking UI is unnecessarily complex. There's also no good mod to compensate. For example, Fast.net provides a straightforward list, but it doesn't remember your filters, can't sort, and doesn't show XP bonuses due to the Heat system.\n+ No mantling or sliding mechanic.\n+ Awkwardly, you can easily respec skill points but you can't respec perk decks.\n+ [Alt-tab functionality is buggy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/n1vryh/payday_2_stops_me_from_using_my_mouse_on_other)\n+ The animation for sprinting while you have the skill to be able to hip fire is very confusing. You can't even tell if you're sprinting anymore.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Payday Wiki](https://payday.fandom.com)\n+ [PD2 Builder](https://pd2builder.netlify.app)\n+ [Mod Workshop](https://modworkshop.net/game/payday-2)\n+ [The Long Guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=267214370)\n+ [Heists sorted by XP/min](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1637070354)\n\nI played through non-Infamy with an Armorer build, initially starting on Hard/Very Hard and then Overkill since Reputation 50. I generally played on Mayhem or Death Wish since then. My experience with different builds:\n\n+ [Shotgun Dodge build](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=1I3I10xc610-90w7l000g100&p=3&a=0&t=4&d=3), using Izhma and Judge. It's clear why this build is meta. It has strong DPS for both mobs and HP-heavy specials like Dozers, high magazine, and high ammo pickup. Shotguns also have quite the range in this game, clearly too overpowered with few flaws as a weapon type and with a powerful skill tree to back it up.\n+ [Sniper Dodge build](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=1I1GnE00b0-900w7t0-7&p=h&a=0&t=4&d=3), using .308 Concealer and Micro Uzi modded for accuracy and stability up to 25 concealment. They're not good. High damage low fire rate snipers like .50 cal and Desert Fox are just not designed well for this game as there's only one special you need high DPS for, Dozers, and there are many other viable DPS solutions. As a low fire rate sniper, you must rely on your secondary for all other scenarios, a tradeoff other high DPS builds don't face. On the other hand, high fire rate snipers like .308 Concealer are effectively just worse Assault Rifles against mobs, and you need more than an entire magazine to kill a Dozer. The Grazer skill is just not good enough compared to other weapons and their skills.\n+ [Akimbo Pistol Dodge Build](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=1I1G0010b0-900xcl0Bq0-4&p=h&a=0&t=e&d=3), using Akimbo STRYK 18c and 5/7 AP. Extremely good DPS from close to medium range, with the single fire killing mobs even in their chest and doing massive DPS against Dozers within a single magazine. The secondary is also excellent to swap to against shields and snipers, and pistols feature an extremely fast swap speed (compared to, e.g., swapping a Judge in a Shotgun build). The pistol skill tree is also clearly among the best.\n+ Akimbo SMG build, using Akimbo Krinkov. Akimbo SMGs are just a worse version of high fire rate akimbo pistols. Auto fire mode can only be used situationally as you cannot sustain its ammo, and SMGs do not benefit from DPS skills like pistols do.\n+ Assault Rifle build.\n+ Akimbo Shotgun build, using Akimbo Goliaths. Just as good as the Dodge Shotgun build but with even more DPS. The ammo pickup for shotguns overall is astounding compared to Akimbo Pistols and SMGs which can easily run out.\n\n__Mods.__ None are essential but they do add quality of life features:\n\n+ WolfHUD is busy but useful after removing the bloat. It has timers for ECM, drills, and even mission equipment that don't natively show a timer. It displays a down counter, pager counter, weapon damage, amount of loot on the map (and amount delivered), stamina, and which jokers are yours. As an interaction, you can avoid having to hold the key which is more casual letting you take a sip from your drink or spam the key as an interactable starts to appear during a mission. It auto-skips reward selection, and for hosts, it auto-skips the blackscreen intro and provides instant restart instead of a 5 second delay. It auto-enables lasers. You can see your crew's setup in more detail, including skills and weapon/item names.\n+ Reconnect to Server avoids losing games where you get disconnected due to server instability or you want to change your loadout.\n+ Simple Crosshairs provides a crosshair in the center without relying on lasers. This is my preferred aim style (and ideally with a dot reticle).\n\ntodos\n\n+ hacker. health regen build. stoic.\n+ Deathwish all levels.\n+ Crime spree.\n+ DSOD.",

    "comments": "Back 4 Blood is a great spiritual successor to Left 4 Dead 2. It's like L4D2 meets the progression mechanics of Killing Floor 2, attachment system of Apex Legends, and roguelites. It has great core mechanics, enemy variety, objective-based level completion, and build variety. Class-based PvE shooters with objectives is a niche subgenre, and I love them all (others with these elements include Team Fortress 2, Vermintide, Overwatch, Deep Rock Galactic, Payday 2, and Killing Floor 2).\n\nFlaw-wise:\n\n+ A difficulty spike from Recruit to Veteran. The increased spawn rate for specials as the form of difficulty can be mindboggling. You can just be unlucky at times when a horde is called and they spawn multiple Bruisers and Hockers. Ammo dumps aren't a fair challenge.\n+ The enemy special's sound and visual design is lacking. For example, Hockers can be unnecessarily tedious in their ability to snipe people and you can't find them if they're not in your POV, especially as you're bombarded with other specials. It's also difficult to distinguish the Special's variant, which is important in knowing how to approach them.\n+ The game lacks built-in methods to better coordinate. Matchmaking to a larger extent is pretty bad.\n\n__Gameplay.__  It's very much like Left 4 Dead 2, and I greatly enjoy the core gameplay loop. The enemies are all designed well with a decent variety: specials like Reekers disincentivize huddling in one area whereas specials like Hockers disincentivize lone stragglers. Special variants can also spice up how you tackle them. \n\nNew to Back 4 Blood, cards add customizability and randomness in each run, and characters each have different perks. Builds include general DPS (Assault Rifle, SMG), frontliner and scavenge hunter (melee, shotgun, SMG), special killer (sniper rifle, shotgun), and support. Money and cards add persistence across rounds. This encourages playing with the same people over the course of multiple levels. It's a nice way to make friends with strangers.\n\nOther new mechanics include: extra lives to revive downed players and the ability to save cleaners in the middle of a round; trauma damage; mutation weak spots; and horde callers like crows, car alarms, and snitches. Weapon mods serve similar to Apex Legends as a way to upgrade your weapon along with their item rarity.\n\nMatchmaking with randoms is a mixed experience. It's rare to play a game with a full set of players for more than 10 minutes, and it's rare for anyone to backfill. There are also communication challenges when playing with randoms: for example, signaling weapon types/builds during character selection, signaling for an ammo type, and calling for a vote to restart the level or kick a player. There's also no option to change characters and decks after a round in order to adapt to your party.\n\nDifficulty acts as a form of progression, where Acts must be unlocked per difficulty. Recruit serves similarly as a Normal difficulty. Veteran is a steep difficulty curve from Recruit, feeling closer to Nightmare than just \"Hard\". The special's spawn rate and lack of cues signaling their presence can be frustrating at times. Left 4 Dead largely fixed this issue by making all the specials still deadly but with low HP, rewarding quick reactions and game awareness; in B4B you can dump an entire magazine and not kill them. At least, after spending dozens of hours to master Veteran, you can start to appreciate all the game's mechanics. Now you're conscious about so many elements that could be ignored on recruit: positioning during hordes, checking behind you and on the lookout for specials, every copper and health kit purchase, grenade usages, and how to kite enemies.\n\nInnovation-wise, the characters and levels are forgettable, having all been done many times in previous games. It's a shame the developers took no risks on these fronts. The level variety is also not nearly on par with Left 4 Dead 2. The campaign is artificially extended as areas are copy pasted and objectives such as \"destroy the nest\" are added yet again. We need more levels like Bar Room Blitz.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Great graphics and rendered cutscenes. Compared to Left 4 Dead, the game most lacks in sound and visual design of enemies. There aren't clear audio cues to signal the presence of specials (especially each  variant). There are some audio cues, but the obfuscation is caused by both general noise pollution and the fact that there's so many Specials at any one time. Enemy special variants can't even be easily distinguished visually, let alone audibly. This is important in knowing the difference between, say, a Bruiser who grabs vs a Bruiser who does an AoE attack vs a Bruiser who is armored, or a Reeker who spits acid vs a Reeker who explodes without acid. [The zombie art and animations also aren't nearly as good as Left 4 Dead's, as well as the lack of breakable environments.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdRLNUGmFC8)\n\nRealism is a popular criticism made against the game due to Left 4 Dead expectations: for example, the characters are designed as cliches, say banal quips, and levels are somehow teeming with fresh weapons and attachments. This is some big nostalgia goggles. Left 4 Dead's setting is also quite generic.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ You can see what items your teammates are carrying. Useful to sync on, say, Toolkit uses.\n+ They kept Left 4 Dead 2's mechanic of being able to melee while reloading.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Back 4 Blood's addition of Call of Duty-like elements. For example, aim down sights with slower movement speed along with a sprint with a stamina bar encourage tactical gameplay rather than Left 4 Dead's arena shooter style of run and gun.\n+ You can't remove weapon attachments. This makes it a more conscious decision when you find your weapon of higher rarity in the wild but it doesn't have the attachments you necessarily want.\n+ I like all the mechanical changes to Veteran difficulty. For example, sleepers spawn mini-hordes. Health stations are only 1 instead of 4. I wish they told us about them though explicitly.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Quick play doesn't save Act progression unless you find a game on the specific stage that you need to advance. This could easily be remedied by saving all Act level progressions but gating the next Act on completing every stage, but not necessarily that all stages must be completed in sequence. This is likely a contributing factor to the lack of people backfilling a match.\n+ You don't get supply points when losing. This makes grinding higher difficulties to overcome them fairly annoying.\n+ Only one Continue. That's not much time to improve over camradarie under the same team. Why have a finite number of Continues in the first place? This is likely coupled with the issue that levels are quite long, and so defeat (particularly with zero rewards) is demoralizing.\n+ The wait time for preparation for a new round is 3 minutes. This is too much waiting. Overwatch only spends 1 minute.\n+ No option to mute all by default.\n+ When you hit a car alarm or break a nest, the zombies instantly know where you are rather than go in alert and explore mode.\n+ No specific stats page like Left 4 Dead's.\n+ No solo progression or offline play, with a connection to online servers at all times.\n+ You're forced into a hub world and not just interacting with a menu. The hub world is also way too large (c.f., Deep Rock Galactic).\n+ It's unintuitive to new players whether triggering an alarm such as destroying a nest during a horde will spawn extra specials and horde enemies.\n+ [Breaker uses a dumb AOE if you go too far away. I greatly prefer L4D's tank who can throw items.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdRLNUGmFC8)\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Card Compendium, including Supply Lines](https://www.reddit.com/r/Back4Blood/comments/p1wsd1/b4b_card_compendium)\n\nI beat all of Normal and Veteran difficulty's campaigns.

    "comments": "Grim Dawn is an excellent action RPG building on elements from titans of the genre. Its unique twists on action RPGs---for example, emphasis on leveling over endgame, a dual class system, devotion mechanic, and fixed level design---all work excellently to make a polished game with a high amount of replayability.\n\n__Story.__ Serviceable. I enjoy the RPG elements with dialogue options as well as the minor ways you can affect the story.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Grim Dawn largely builds on prior ARPGs like Titan Quest and Diablo 2: multiple game playthroughs each of increasing difficulty, health/mana, XP, and the death penalty, stat attributes, skill tree, taxonomy of damage types and resistances, and item stats with affixes and rarity. I particularly like the additional challenge that Elite and Ultimate have over Normal, where Normal is closer to the tutorial. Enemies don't nearly melt as easily in Elite and Normal so you have to be more considerate about survivability gear, skills, kiting, positioning and enemy awareness.\n\n[The new mechanics in the ARPG genre are quite interesting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vCn3DlRuvapxItysOLweSGFbjIvVJ2fKP43J_Svpbss/edit). In terms of builds:\n\n+ Unlike ARPGs like Diablo 2 and PoE, the main campign with leveling is the main content and any endgame content are side filler. I greatly prefer this approach as Diablo and PoE largely encourages players to rush through the campaign in order to proceed to endgame.\n+ Mastery system of dual \"classes\" per character. This enables quite high build diversity as you mix-and-match classes, sometimes using one as your main class or otherwise doing a full hybrid.\n+ Devotion, where devotion shrines provide challenges rewarding a devotion point. These devotion points are then allocated to a devotion tree. Devotion shrines are particularly nice because they encourage exploration as ARPGs otherwise optimize for point A->B for quest completion.\n+ A simplification of stats to just physique (health/defensive ability), cunning (physical damage but primarily physical gear), and spirit (magic damage but primarily magic gear).\n\nIn terms of gear:\n+ Armor system based on body parts, where body part armor only contributes to that area.\n+ Crafting system. It's a significant improvement from the Horadric Cube with built-in recipe system, blueprints to discover, crafting materials can be stored in the stash, and more thorough crafting materials.\n+ A built-in loot filter.\n+ Components serve as Diablo's gems and runes.\n+ Actual usage of currency (iron): stash space, faction writs and mandates for faster reputation gain, faction blueprints, and crafting.\n\nIn terms of level design:\n\n+ Fixed level design, focusing on a well-crafted campaign instead of procedural level generation.\n+ Constitution quickly regenerates health out of combat. This avoids any tedium in potion management, something both Diablo 2 and Path of Exile could learn from.\n+ Quest tracking with multiple quests, side quests included.\n+ Illusion of choice in quest dialogues to influence the story.\n+ Factions and reputation. It's particularly interesting to see their importance in an ARPG as a way of obtaining augments (components) to improve resistances at higher difficulties.\n+ Material blockers such as Scraps, Dynamite, and Skeleton Key.\n+ Skeleton Key challenge areas.\n+ Level scaled areas up to the area's level cap.\n\nBoss fights are mediocre. ARPGs have badly designed bosses in general: they result in either kiting, facetanking, or with the occasional bullet hell. The overall gameplay loop in ARPGs is about being overpowered enough to spam a few abilities, quickly wiping out mobs under your desired style (e.g., caster, ranged physical, and melee). Combat would be more mechanically involved if they borrowed elements from 2D soulslike/metroidvania games: dodge and block/parry system as well as telegraphed attacks.\n\nIn Grim Dawn's meta, close range and movement is key. There are many mobs that either shoot from range or close in on you quickly so standing to shoot is often not a good amount of DPS; and there is a large amount of mobs, often in closed areas, so you can't just snipe. This incentivizes builds around melee, including mobile casters. I like this change in meta over, say, Diablo 2 where melee is highly underpowered and ranged such as Sorceress or Javazon reign king.\n\nGrim Dawn has many nice additions that improve replayability with new characters. For example, after reaching Act 2 Ultimate, you can have any additional character immediately start on Elite or Ultimate and unlock the associated backpack and stat/skill point rewards from Normal and Elite quests. You can also purchase Mandates from characters achieving Revered on any faction in order to accelerate faction reputation on new characters. The additional game modes of Crucible and Shattered Realm can serve as alternative forms of leveling so you can coast through much of the initial Acts.\n\nGrim Dawn's endgame is standard. Replayability is primarily about playing through the campaign with new builds. However, the two game modes of Crucible and Shattered Realm do add an endless set of randomized encounters to test your optimized endgame builds. Like any ARPG endgame, this can be fun for a while but quickly becomes repetitive.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ I like the dark gritty aesthetic. It's what Diablo 3 should have looked like. The dialogue is only partially voiced, which is a shame. The cutscenes are also clearly budget.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ So many quality of life details over Diablo 2: no stamina meter; skills are immediately activated from the keybind rather than swapped to for left/right click; you can auto-sort the inventory; inventory and stash space; stack items; right click to equip gear; ranged weapons don't require tedious ammo micromangement; no need for identify and portal scrolls; dying doesn't make you naked to recover your corpse; you can recover either the component or the item; you can see the (de)buffs you have; autoloot materials option.\n+ Destructible objects shine when they have an item of rarity. That way you don't have to spam interact with everything.\n+ Mod support.\n+ If you complete certain quest objectives like killing a boss prior to being given the quest, then the quest is automatically completed. No need to redo it.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ I dislike the ARPG trend of loot filters to deal with the fact that later on, all items below a certain rarity are automatically useless. Instead of this manual tedium, have the item drops upgrade with us and just don't include these bad drops. In the case of Grim Dawn, you can safely ignore whites after your character has all equipped slots, yellows at level 20-30, and greens at level 50.\n+ When progressing through a voiced NPC's quest dialogue, it doesn't skip lines and go to the next wall of text. This makes reading the quest text annoying at times.\n+ Multiplayer scene is largely dead. I greatly enjoy its single player and occasional mix of coop with friends. If multiplayer were better incentivized such as a real trading economy, then the game could be kept more alive and active.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Grim Dawn Wiki](https://grimdawn.fandom.com), including [quests](https://grimdawn.fandom.com/wiki/Quests)\n+ [Farming Routes Compilation](https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/farming-routes-farming-guides-compilation)\n+ [Patch 1.1.8.1 and 1.1.9.0 Tier List](https://www.reddit.com/r/Grimdawn/comments/jqg0p6/patch_1181_class_tier_list)\n\nThis entry includes all expansions. I played on Normal instead of Veteran difficulty as the XP and slower clear speed isn't worth it: just move onto Elite and Ultimate. I played according to the release order: Normal Act 1-4 -> Ashes of Malmouth's Act 5-6 -> Forgotten Gods -> Elite -> Ultimate -> Shattered Realms + Crucible. In Normal, I explore everything and do all side quests. In Elite and Ultimate, I optimize for fast completion and XP. I stopped playing after roughly Act 2 in Ultimate. I got burned out of ARPGs after having played Diablo 2 Resurrected previously and feeling the content get rather stale on Ultimate, which is effectively a third (but more challenging) playthrough. My first character was a Spellbinder ([1](https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/caster-beginners-nephrite-spellbinder), [2](https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/1-1-8-0-albrecht-the-leech-super-tanky-aether-aar-spellbinder-3-versions-ravager-killer-very-easy-sr-80), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jY7_Ix-mS4)).",

    "comments": "Diablo 2 Resurrected is fun to play as an HD trip down memory lane. There are many elements that Diablo 2 did just right in its balance of streamlined ARPG elements and RPG complexity. It's an excellent experience across solo, coop, and playing with randoms. Both leveling and endgame are fun.\n\nFlaws:\n\n1. Diablo II's endgame, build variety, and itemization are all severely lacking compared to modern ARPGs like Path of Exile, Diablo 3, and Grim Dawn. The \"endgame\" after completing Hell where you grind MF, RF, and XP through Baal runs, level 85 areas, and the like is dull content for little reward. Itemization is also a travesty: there are so many useless unique and set gear, and certain items are so powerful they overwhelm everything else across all classes. It's patch 1.10 that truly exacerbated the itemization problem: Insight, Enigma, Infinity, Grief, Arachnid, Spirit, HoTo, Fortitude, Andariel's Visage.\n2. The lobby is a terrible experience. Zero search functionality or sorting, which in turn makes for a terrible experience for trading and farming with randoms. Games with randoms are also not designed well as its design incentivizes competition over cooperation.\n3. Hell difficulty's many damage immunities make nearly every build annoying to clear any area: it's the forced specialization to maximally farm certain areas while creating other characters to farm another area that makes end-to-end solo play rather frustrating. The gameplay is also quite dated: for example, left/right click for skills, no item stacks requiring character mules, bad trading implementation, terrible online lobby discoverability.\n\n__Story.__ It's a fairly basic lore and not good to be honest, not unlike other Blizzard game. At least it allows for some cool character designs (especially the bosses) and cool cutscenes.\n\n__Gameplay.__ D2 reinforced all the major elements of an ARPG: isometric camera design, attributes, skill trees, equipment (and random gear generation and qualities), level design, enemy variety, a trading system based on usable items.\n\nD2 was invented prior to the concept of endgame really existing, and it shows. There is no endgame content aside from clearing Hell bosses faster and fighting Uber bosses. Itemization is bad as you're reliant on key gear such as Enigma due to just how powerful Teleport is and with arbitrary item synergies where set items aren't good. After about level 20, stamina as a mechanic is basically useless as you can run most anywhere. Attribute-wise, Vitality is always the best because Strength/Dexterity don't provide nearly enough DPS to make their stats worth it beyond gear requirements and Energy is subpar compared to mana potions. Gold is useless beyond vendor interactions. Act 2's Mercenary with Insight is almost always the best. Barbarian, Assassin, and Druid aren't as good at levels 70+ compared to the other classes. I also have mixed feelings about of the gameplay loop reliance of Teleport and spamming mana potions (all builds during Normal/Nightmare; and it lasts until kill speeds are fast enough and your merc has Insight).\n\nPlaying in public lobbies is the epitome of a dog eat dog world. The loot problem is an insane rush to spam click and pick up items before others. Similarly, people rush by going through quests but which aren't necessarily synced across a party and instead everyone has to be there, so someone can get locked out. And public lobbies for certain Baal runs are competitive to join, especially with a good sorc to get to Throne and fast killer. High level players can join low level games purely for the player count to farm a different area. There are also a number of things that provide very insecure contracts that are ripe for deception: rushes for Hellforge, waypoint requests. There's even a meta with people rushing Acts 1-2, then ask someone for a WP to Act 3 Travincal, then ask for a WP to Act 5; this makes a full game of rush much less possible as it's simply more efficient to do partway rushes and beg for the WPs. Even during lobby Chaos / Baal runs, the sorc or anyone else who teleports to the boss doesn't get any reward compared to those who just wait for the TP and similarly, those who AFK in the Throne Room while others do damage. Without integrated voice chat, there's also hardly any dialogue. In the meta, you want to join group games for: rushing, Chaos/Baal runs, and trading. You can at least safely MF/RF in private.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Game is gorgeous, particularly as a modern ARPG and where the only baselines for comparison at this point are, say, Path of Exile, Diablo 3, and Grim Dawn which are all at least 5 years old.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ As Resurrected uses patch 1.14, you can now respec. That wasn't possible until patch 1.13c in 2010! This is especially important as the optimal STR/DEX allocations depends on the current gear.\n+ New to Resurrected, you can autoloot gold.\n+ All core mechanics are preserved, including even breakpoints such as for Faster Cast Speed and Increased Attack Speed which are fundamentally based on 25 FPS.\n+ New to Resurrected, you can now kill the Cow King without locking you out of the Cow level.\n+ You can now link a specific item in chat like in WoW.\n+ Light radius is a prominent lighting feature.\n+ Armor types have different effects on stamina and movement speed.\n+ New to Resurrected, there's now a shared stash with much more storage space. We need more tabs though! I still have to make mule characters for their personal tab, e.g., named Jewels, Gems, LowRunes, and LowRunes2. Please just let items like runes stack.\n+ New to Resurrected, a more advanced stat page. Not having to manually count MF, FCR, and FHR is nice!\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Diablo 2's center minimap spawned a trend in action RPGs. So functionally useful but so ugly. It's nicer to have it in the corner but it's also harder to navigate that way. I eventually got used to the corner minimap and the game is significantly more immersive!\n+ Some bugs that define meta in D2 are removed in Resurrected: STR/DEX bug to have items self-equip no longer works; and ethereal bug to boost armor defense no longer works.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Lobby provides no search functionality to filter games. Similarly, remaking a game for public runs requires incrementing and hoping you can make it before the game fills.\n+ Lock outs: Getting the Halls of Pain waypoint will lock you out of farming Pindleskin via the entrance ([now fixed!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/pur6xo/info_for_all_the_pindle_portal_stays_open_now)). Hiring a new mercenary before unequipping your previous mercenary means you lose their gear. Missing the Andariel quest bug for extra loot.\n+ Shared drops based on who can pick it up quickly didn't age well, especially when playing with randoms.\n+ You must swap to the skill, then use the skill with your left or right mouse. Boy that didn't age well.\n+ Every new game you have to turn on the auto map and the always display items toggles. They're not on by default.\n+ Potions don't automatically go from inventory to potion belt. This is particularly annoying in early game when you spam mana potions for many builds and you have to juggle putting inventory potions into the belt.\n+ You can't easily buy stacks of potions. Instead, the strategy is to shift-right click to load your belt, then unequip your belt, and repeat. Similarly, there is no button to automatically repair all equipment, including those in your inventory. You have to manually repair items in your inventory.\n+ No inspect gear option like WoW.\n+ No keybind to fast equip items like right click.\n+ No WoW-like HUD to indicate what buffs are on you.\n+ It's still incredibly easy to accidentally drop a valuable item and lose it forever to a random.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Diablo Wiki](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki)\n+ [Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/d2)\n+ [maxroll.gg's tier lists](https://d2.maxroll.gg) | It's a great summary across the key dimensions: MF, RF, Chaos/Baal runs, uber bosses, PvP, and speedruns.\n+ [d2jsp](https://forums.d2jsp.org) | The unofficial trading resource. Sadly it also does RMT.\n+ [Magic find diminishing returns](https://diablo2.diablowiki.net/Magic_find_diminishing_returns)\n+ [Maxroll's Drop Calculator](https://d2.maxroll.gg/d2-drop-calculator)\n+ [Maxroll's general leveling guide](https://d2.maxroll.gg/resources/general-leveling), including class-specific ones\n+ [MF and RF build efficiency guide](https://www.purediablo.com/forums/threads/guide-build-efficiency-101-%E2%80%93-overview-resource-compilation.166)\n\n__On classes.__ My first character was an Amazon. [Javazon](https://d2.maxroll.gg/guides/lightning-fury-amazon-guide) excels most in boss clear speeds, is good at MF/RF, and scales decently from budget to BiS gear. Javazons are the best for rune runs at the Cow level (rune runs also include, e.g., base items and gems). I can also try a [ice Bowazon build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa-pOuLu62w). However, they have notable flaws:\n\n1. They're not the best at MF: Amazons have the lowest FCR breakpoints for Teleport and can't stack much MF.\n2. Javazons at a budget are especially annoying due to the lack of Infinity to kill Lightning immune enemies, greatly restricting the areas where they're viable (including Pits, their main level 85 area).\n3. Micromanagement. Javelins require repair and semiregular switching. Once you have an Infinity and replace your mercenary's Insight, it also becomes a pain to micromanage mana potions.\n\nMy second character is a Blizzard Sorc. Sorc is truly the required ladder starter class. Every class is less efficient than Sorc without critical endgame gearâacross MF, RF, and XPâand most classes still aren't better than Sorc at their optimum. Sorcs scale well from budget to BiS gear. The especially notable gear requirements are Enigma for every build as Teleport is the best skill in the game; Infinity for elemental builds as otherwise you're unable to easily run past immune enemies (especially without Enigma); and gear-intensive builds like Grief for Pitzerker. Sorcs also benefit from high tier build variety such as meteorb, frozen orb, and lightning. [Classes outside Paladin and Sorceress are restricted to only 1-2 excellent build archetypes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/m26ci3/every_diablo_2_character_build_a_response_to)\n\nIn retrospect, a Sorc is universally better than a Javazon. It is a better budget class than Javazon as Blizzard spec, especially because Javazon can't do Pit without Enigma and Infinity. At endgame, a Lightning Sorc competes with Javazon in being just as good in terms of clear speeds (killing slightly slower but teleporting slightly faster), is better at MF as Blizzard spec, and has many viable farm areas. Sorc also doesn't have to micromanage Javelin capacity.\n\nMy third character was a Hammerdin. Unlike Javazons, Hammerdins face few magic immune enemies, can keep the mercenary's Insight for mana regeneration, and boasts the highest run/walk speed for movement (including in town). They trade off a Javazon's DPS with tankiness, can stack more MF, have better FCR, and don't have to micromanage mana potions or javelins. This is a safe, versatile playstyle. The damage pathing for Hammerdins can be annoying though, particularly without Enigma to telestomp. While Hammerdin is great at level 85 areas including Pits and Chaos Sanctuary, it's worse at Pindleskin (Eldritch and Shenk are alternatives) and Cows (Travincal is an alternative).\n\nBy the time I quit, I had all GG gear for Hammerdin excluding Enigma with 125 FCR, 75 AR, and 370 MF. I farmed Chaos Sanctuary. I ended up selling all my expensive items, resulting in 5k FG on d2jsp (gave to Danny).\n\n__On hardcore.__ I like the idea of hardcore especially as a way of spicing up the game, focusing on the overall experience and not just rushing to endgame and getting gear. However, it's hard to trust that the death is indeed your fault: you could simply die from server lag, an unlucky teleport from another player you enter, some especially frustrating mob packs, and many others.\n\n__Multiboxing.__ I purchased two accounts, with one account having my Sorceress. That way I can rush my own characters and hold games. I tried renaming and having a second copy of the client. That didn't work. I tried using Sandboxie but it didn't work, [with these same issues](https://forums.d2jsp.org/topic.php?t=85481312). [Solutions.](https://forums.d2jsp.org/topic.php?t=86670976)\n\n__On endgame gear.__ The grind for endgame builds is certainly something from the late 90s. Items are expensive, and MF/RF runs are grindy with low payout over hours to days, where item drop rates are significantly even more rare than, say, WoW raids and where the item pool per enemy is so large it's impossible to try to target a specific item. This forces you to do trading, and there's just no legitimate tool for this at a large scale. I grinded for a while to get a sense of the gameplay loop. Then I resorted to RMT to get an initial boost in terms of the biggest items (e.g., Titan's Revenge). Of course, RMT is effectively like cheating at a single player game: you want to only do it enough to reduce repetitive content but you don't want to go so far there's no longer any value to look forward to in the game.",

    "comments": "Project Warlock is an excellent retro FPS shooter, particularly excelling in its weapon variety, controls, RPG mechanics, and audiovisual aesthetic. It takes the highlight weapons of titans in the genre, and each has a purpose against enemies.\n\nFlaw-wise, Project Warlock has rather forgettable levels and an overall too easy difficulty. I think the game could easily take a unique position if it leaned into the idea of a retro FPS roguelite: much harder difficulty (you have to learn over multiple trials before even getting close to beat the game), randomized level generation, Risk of Rain 2-like items, and more diverse builds.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The core gameplay loop is excellent: navigate to find the exit by getting keys, fighting enemies, and looting ammo and gold (XP). Something about the game just makes the simple idea of shooting so fun: for example, the sound effects, weapon animations, enemy stagger. Each level has several stages which then progresses you back to the Workshop hub so you can upgrade weapons and stats before going to the next level.\n\nEnemy variety is particularly good, borrowing elements from other Doomlike games as you aim to kite melee enemies and dodge projectile attacks. Certain enemies encourage certain weapons, leading to a diverse weapon usage that goes beyond balancing ammo usage. Similarly, the overall weapon variety is good, and there's good reason to use different weapons depending on the situation. I found myself quickswitching often.\n\nLevels are intuitively designed and place environmental interactions (e.g., locked doors, barrels) and enemies well. I never really felt lost or even needed to resort to my map. They're fairly unoriginal flat designs almost like Wolfenstein 3D (although not convoluted nor empty). But the levels greatly kept with the consistency of the fast pace, which is something older shooters can often ruin (e.g., Duke Nukem 3D).\n\nThe game plays similar to a roguelike: it has a fixed number of lives (up to 3) and there are no saves: running out of lives means starting over. I especially like the RPG mechanics with upgrading stats and weapons. As a roguelike, this enables different playthrough styles. I only wish the levels also enabled random generation to make this an actual thing, and with Risk of Rain-like abilities.\n\nControls are standard for a doomlike with WASD, fast movement speed, Jump as interact, and number keys to change to a weapon type followed by pressing the number key again for a specific weapon in that type.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The shaded pixel graphics is a nice artistic design that ages well for an indie game. Weapon sound effects and animations are satisfying. I love the soundtrack.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Blood's dynamite as a weapon for AOEing large mobs.\n+ Shadow Warrior's akimbo SMGs for high fire rate spray at mobs or single target DPS.\n+ This was developed over 4 years by an 18 year old while in high school? That's commendable.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Fuck the final boss. It's such a different fight than the rest of the game because it's just a game of ammo conservation.\n+ You can't change your weapon upgrade.\n+ Brightness can be inconsistent at times, being particularly too dark in certain levels.\n+ [Windowed mode keeps changing resolution when you have multiple monitors, which makes borderless unplayable.](https://steamcommunity.com/app/893680/discussions/1/1744479698798113409)\n+ Mouse sensitivity doesn't go low enough. I had to use 1 ingame sensitivity and set my mouse to 400 DPI.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI played on Hard difficulty. I went for a HP/capacity build and generally used all weapons to balance ammo usage. My favorite weapons are: Shotgun (+Super Shotgun), SMG (+Chaingun), Dynamite for wide AOE, Crossbow and Rocket Launcher for narrow corridors and single target DPS, and Pistol and Staff on trash for conserving ammo. Closer to endgame, I situationally used the Magic powers for armor and more ammo.",

    "comments": "Max Payne is a solid action shooter with a decent story and which particularly innovated with its Bullet Time mechanic. Dodging bullets and using Bullet Time to quickly kill mobs of enemies is a great feeling that ages well even in 2021.\n\nGameplay is fairly repetitive and you've pretty much seen all the game has to offer by the first Part. There aren't new mechanics or enemies.\n\n__Story.__ The narration works well to provide context behind the gameplay. I especially like the comic style to do this. It's a classic film noir: undercover cop going after a drug story, but I still enjoyed it as a setting for the gameplay.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Max Payne's claim to fame is its Bullet Time mechanic, alongside shootdodge as a unique dodge ability for shooters. Playing in 2021, Bullet Time works particularly well as a way to enable guns in a world that would otherwise cause more passive cover shooting mechanics. It's also nice to see the last enemy in a mob be killed in slow-mo. Bullet Time enhances an otherwise serviceable shooter.\n\nMax Payne has good linear level design with a variety in settings. But it has mediocre weapon and enemy variety. There are indeed many weapons in Max Payne but there's often not really a reason to switch up your choice of weapon. I generally favored Dual Beretta and Dual Uzi. Shotguns are less forgivable as missing a shot meant getting punished as fire rate is low and you have to reload; and enemies may not be close enough. With high fire rate weapons, you benefit from enemy stagger. I resort to Desert Eagle when low on ammo on my favored weapons: I like that a well-placed headshot with one bullet is sufficient to down an enemy. So a Desert Eagle plays the opposite of a high fire rate low damage weapon.\n\nControls are simple and intuitive. They're not unlike other PC shooters like Half-Life, including a Quick-save and Quick-load option.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Developed during the beginnings of 3D shooters, the textures and polygon count certainly doesn't age well.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ The dot cross hair. I love precise aim in shooters.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Bosses are rather annoying bullet sponges.\n+ There's a bit of reliance on savescumming as a shotgun enemy can one-shot you.\n+ The game requires setup to play in 2021. You need a [sound fix](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Max_Payne#Missing_audio). Widescreen requires a [fix for the stretched resolution](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Max_Payne). Windowed requires [-skipstartup -window](https://steamcommunity.com/app/12140/discussions/0/1621724915792340876) and Borderless Gaming doesn't work. To play at my favored low sensitivity, I had to set to 400 DPI and use the lowest ingame sensitivity. There are no subtitle options. [Part III's nightmare sequence is also broken.](https://steamcommunity.com/app/12140/discussions/0/224446432330178053)\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nMotivated by a [GmanLives video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuNbIm3PswA), I played with the [First Person Payne mod](https://www.moddb.com/mods/first-person-payne). It integrates into the game well with little jank beside the occasional moving body part and needing to swap out during the nightmare levels. I played a little in the vanilla third-person but I greatly prefer the first person viewpoint as it improves aiming and immersion for such an action-heavy game (like a Doom-like F.E.A.R.). Surprisingly, even shootdodge still works well in first person. I keybinded Bullet Time only on RMB and Shootdodge on Shift so I can control when to use which. With Bullet Time Combo, strafing would always Shootdodge when you only want to do it at specific times.",

Jak and Daxter retains Crash's core ideas such as precise platforming, collectithon, and a memorable cast including supporting characters and villains. There isn't much new in terms of the gameplay that keeps it as innovative as the platforming ideas originating in, say, Crash Bandicoot or Spyro. But it's still quite a blast to play as one of the titans of the 3D platformer genre.\n\n__Story.__ Simple but enjoyable story and rich with interesting supporting characters. The way you complete tasks to be rewarded with a collectible reminds me a lot of Spyro.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The game is a collectithon with three currencies: power cells, precursor orbs, and scout flies, the latter two of which reward power cells.\n\nControls inherit from Crash Bandicoot with a (double) jump, spin attack, ground pound, and crouch jump. There are additional moves: punch, jumping uppercut, roll jump.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The cartoon style is timeless, with soft curves, a colorful palette, and smooth emotive animations.

Voice acting is also spot-on: you can really attests to the personality in each character.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ All the audio hints that Daxter provides in case you don't know what to do or want further confirmation. \"We need to get you charged with blue stuff to get you through this door.\"\n+ Generous checkpoints and without an extraneous Lives system like in Super Mario.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ There's no tracker item to find the remaining Precursor Orbs that you're hunting for.

Playing in September 2021, RPCS3's default settings worked for me (e.g., Recompiler (LLVM) for CPU's PPU Decoder and Vulkan for GPU Renderer). I set the framelimit (autos to 60 FPS) as the game speed is tied to 60 FPS. At 2x native resolution (2560x1440p), I see occasional frame rate dips from 60 to 40-50 FPS which causes annoying stutters that slow the game's speed (e.g., near fountains, lots of particle effects), and with occasional game freezes. 1.5x native resolution (1920x1080p) is more stable but still has stutter and freezes. I got 100% completion, which I surprisingly found did not really require a walkthrough or much backtracking.\n\nI remember watching Danny play this game as a kid when we had a PS2.

    "comments": "I like Super Mario Sunshine most for its ambitions: in the same way Super Mario 64 added analog stick in a 3D environment, Majora's Mask took a darker spin, and Resident Evil 4 revolutionized the series' camera control. Most notable are Super Mario Sunshine's storyline, its new core mechanics with the addition of a water pump that sprays water in directions and adds to his jump moveset, and a generally harder difficulty.\n\nFlaw-wise, Sunshine has a camera that improves upon SM64's with manual camera control but is still quite bad. I also prefer more direction in knowing the objective where each star is instead of wandering haphazardly. It's quite annoying overcoming a platforming hurdle but the star is nowhere to be seen. It also stalls pacing as resort to looking up how to progress. Finally, the use of power-ups (nozzle types) and Yoshi seem like an afterthought and don't appear too frequently in the game.\n\n__Story.__ There's more of a story here compared to past Super Mario games. It's the same old kidnapping, but there are more supporting characters with a whole town setting as well as the villains' motivation. World levels also progress as you attain Shrine Sprites.\n\n__Gameplay.__ My favorite part of the Super Mario series' gameplay---standing out across all other platformers in the genre---is their moveset. It has both a low skill floor with simple, intuitive controls and a high skill ceiling with Mario's diverse moveset and a momentum design over precision. Sunshine inherits a lot of the emergent combinations in SM64 and adds new ones as a result of the FLUDD. This adds quite new mechanics for platforming although it also squanders a lot of Mario's pre-FLUDD moveset.\n\n+ __Ground movement.__\n    + New to Sunshine, water slide and hover slide (FLUDD on ground + dive) provide the fastest ground movement. However, they are hard to control and can be difficult to execute as you must manage FLUDD's active state.\n    + Dive+Rollout for fast ground movement which is more controllable.\n    + SM64's long jump is removed unfortunately as crouch is replaced with the FLUDD. One alternative is Spin Jump, which covers the most air distance. Another alternative is to dive in the air. Neither quite serves the same function: they're slow as a jump---for example, it does not enable a faster 0-60 start than just running and spamming Dive+Rollout.\n+ __Vertical movement.__.\n    + New to Sunshine, FLUDD lets you increase height and glide in air. TURBO increases height even more.\n    + New to Sunshine, Spin Jump provides the highest vertical movement. Spin Jump also has several advanced variants. Single+Double+Triple Jump also exists, but unfortunately, Spin Jump largely makes Triple Jump obsolete.\n    + Sideflip for high stationary jumps which are more controllable. It's not as high as Spin Jump but is easier to control. Backward Somersault also exists but requires FLUDD making it harder to use.\n    + Wall jump for bouncing off walls.\n    + Ground pound for halting momentum and preventing fall damage.\n+ __Attacks.__\n    + Jump + Burst Spray (Jump+FLUDD also known as Shotgun Spray) performs a spammable AoE attack.\n    + Spin spray (Spin jump+FLUDD) for a large 360 AoE attack.\n    + Y-Spray lets you have more precise aim.\n\nSunshine continues SM64's idea of a collectithon with a hub and an arsenal of levels, each with a variety of Shrine Sprites and 100 coins which reward a Shrine Sprite. Level design is excellent. There are some new environmental interactions: for example, diving onto water lets you slide similar to snow diving in SM64; you can spray water on flowers to let them grow or have windfills spin faster.\n\nThe world levels with multiple objectives work well. However, the pace greatly suffered as I frequently got lost not knowing what to do. This was not a rare occurence for me (e.g., Gelato Beach's Episode 2 to topple the monsters off the mirrors, Sirena Beach's Episode 3 to discover the hotel mystery).\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The colorful graphics and art style age well even in Gamecube's 480p. Cutscenes are fairly blurry and unfortunately don't age as well given that they're prerendered. Audio soundtrack is excellent as usual in a Super Mario title.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ The idea of a boss fight based on dental cleaning. Very cute. Terrible controls though.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ The levels where Mario has his FLUDD taken away.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Star progression in a level is linear, not allowing more arbitrary exploration as in SM64. This hampers both SM64's freedom with replayability and a helpful mitigation of the issue when you're stuck progressing toward a specific star objective. Namely, you make much more progress as you explore an area and gain other stars.\n+ Camera controls are inverted by default. The horizontal camera control is opposite from modern default camera controls (pressing left moves the angle so you can see more from the right of the character instead of more from the left of the character). Moving down on the vertical horizontal camera lets you see more above you. There are no options to invert. Hardcoding controls in emulator also doesn't work because you aim with your left stick, and you can't just swap that one as it also controls movement.\n+ You aim your water gun with left stick, not right stick. Not only does this limit movement as you can't move while shooting, but aiming is just much less intuitive than a typical console shooter.\n+ Fuck Pianta Village Episode 4. The chuckster secret level is so unreliable.\n+ Mario lives seem like an outdated mechanic. All they do is kick you out of the world. This only has a consequence where you're in a level that's within another level (e.g., secret worlds) and otherwise is tedious as you have to run from the start back to the world entrance.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Movement, tricks, routes and version differences - SMS Any% Tutorial 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYynoHSwP9A)\n+ [Movement Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g631GAwB-IM)\n+ [StrategyWiki walkthrough](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Sunshine)\n\nI played on a Gamecube emulator (Dolphin).

    "comments": "Psychonauts is a wonderful action-adventure disguised as a 3D platformer collectithon. It stands out in its story, characters, unique psychic setting, and creative level design. The gameplay features standard collectithon elements but also strings it along in an adventure form as you use combat abilities, explore areas with multiple routes, dilly-dally to pick up story elements like reading signs or talking to NPCs, and complete story objectives.\n\nGameplay is not great by any means, and what to do next can be obtuse. But the story adventure is enough to keep you interested to play to the end.\n\n__Story.__ The characters and the script's overall humor is charming. It's like watching a Rugrats, Invader Zim, or other cheeky Nickelodeon animation. So many lines across character dialogues, even sidechatter, is so cute. But it's also grounded in a lot of truths, such as various dilemmas in evil characters being rooted in something more sinister.\n\nI also love how the story uses mental worlds as a way to provide deeper characterization, with levels each depicting a person's internal struggles in abstract form.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Platforming is a collectithon, involving figments, emotional baggage, vaults, arrowheads, PSI cards, cobwebs, and PSI cores. Many of these collectibles increase your Psychonaut's current rank which in turn provides new powers or power upgrades.\n\nLevel design is excellent, from the hub with the campgrounds to the mental areas that are more abstract. I love the creativity of certain levels which are so creative. For examples: Lungfishopolis has you playing as a kaiju destroying buildings in a city like a Rampage game; Milkman Conspiracy with the suburban conspiracy; Gloria Theater requires interacting with a stage that can change from mood lighting; Waterloo World requires going big and small as you recruit and move pieces; Black Velvetopia involves navigating narrow alleyways with paintings and a bull; Meat Circus is a fusion of Oleander and Rasputin's minds.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The art style ages well. Voice acting is also excellent. I'm particularly surprised just how much voice acting goes on in this game.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ The main Figment collectible features unique drawing figments instead of just the same art asset.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ The moving figments. Adds more variety but also can be annoying to try to catch, especially given the figments are 2D planes.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ The transparency of Figments can make them hard to see at times.\n+ Milkman Conspiracy level. I love the idea of the level. The clues to complete an objective can be annoyingly obtuse; at the least, it's inconsistent with the clarity of all other level's objectives.\n+ The final level proceeds automatically and is a point of no return. No exploration to pick up everything else remaining before you end the game.\n+ All PC settings are through .ini files and not an ingame HUD. You also have to use Borderless Gaming for borderless.\n+ PC port supports widescreen resolutions, but the assets are stretched. Fortunately, there's a [fix](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Psychonauts).\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI was originally motivated to play this after seeing Psychonauts 2 at E3 2019. Go Tim Shafer and Erik Wolpaw. I played on PC. I played blind and didn't care too much about trying to capture everything as it would slow down the pace every level.",

It has all the elements of an immersive sim---gripping atmosphere, characters, subtle sound design and enemy ambush cues, logs and ammo to incentivize exploration---paired with combat and RPG elements.\n\nFlaw-wise, Bioshock 2 shares Bioshock 1's dated shooting mechanics, where aim is imprecise (including headshots), movement controls are lacking, and difficulty settings translate to damage and health scaling. I found the core gameplay loop not very engaging in 2021 and unlike Bioshock 1, there isn't enough novelty here to keep me playing.\n\n__Story.__ Core atmosphere is the same. There's more depth behind ADAM and supporting characters.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Most new is that you play as a Big Daddy, which means that you can now dual-wield plasmid and weapon, and you have several new weapons such as the Drill. These are core gameplay changes that help make the core loop more thrilling. It is largely the same however: Plasmid and weapon selection; harvest or adopt Little Sisters; enemies (only a few extra like Brute Slicers and female Big Daddies).\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Hacking minigame is now real-time and faster-paced, taking you less out of the base gameplay.\n+ Research camera is now a video, meaning less interruption during the gameplay, and without the need to manage ammo.\n+ Like Bioshock 1, money and ADAM are separate currencies, so you're not incentivized to squander your cash as it's only ever used for replenishing ammo and restorative items. The wallet also has a cap of $600-800.\n+ Winter Blast (at level 2+) finally lets you loot shattered bodies. So loot is no longer a tradeoff for this powerful single-target CC compared to Electro Bolt (level 3)'s AOE. It further synergizes with Freeze Drill.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ I faced semiregular game crashes, and [there is no consistent fix and only with folktale wisdom such as vsync and compatibility mode](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1659202156).\n+ You can't backtrack to previous levels.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Power to the People locations](https://bioshock.fandom.com/wiki/Power_to_the_People#Locations_in_BioShock_2)\n+ [Gene Tonic Locations](https://www.ign.com/wikis/bioshock-2/Gene_Tonic_Locations)\n\nI played on [Normal difficulty](https://bioshock.fandom.com/wiki/BioShock_Game_Options#Difficulty) as I find Hard difficulty to just be too spongey, with item shimmer (to avoid pixel hunting) and without the quest arrow (the map is fine). I played blind but looked up collectible lists in case I missed a Power to the People or Gene Tonic before ending each level. I rebinded keys so weapons are only 1-5 (6-8 as Mouse4-5 and F), plasmid change with mousewheel, E interact, Q heal, H hack, Z logs, V melee. I stopped playing at the beginning of Dionysus Park.\n\nI remember playing the multiplayer a lot around 2011. I didn't do the campaign. I greatly enjoyed BioShock 1, but hear that BioShock 2 is just more of the same: incremental changes with most polishing in the core gameplay, but nothing more notable regarding the plot or characters.

    "comments": "Hyper Light Drifter is an isometric action that's particularly notable in its tight combat loop and creative vision of visual storytelling, pixel aesthetics, and atmospheric soundtrack.\n\nFlaw-wise, hidden areas can be obscure and there's generally just a bad visual design as you must, e.g., force yourself to walk along edges to discover things rather than a visual cue signaling a breakable wall. NPCs don't really do much, and even for its ambiguous storytelling there just isn't much of a story to be told. It would be nice to see an interconnecting theme one could analyze as you traverse the various enemy and boss designs, or the powers you accumulate over time. Enemy and boss designs are serviceable.\n\n__Story.__ The game focuses on symbolic imagery and cryptic speech, where for example NPC interactions only involve a soundbyte or image. There is little to no text, including even with merchant or upgrade HUDs. I love the idea of it, but the NPCs don't share any sense of character development or progression. It's disappointing given that it would be nice to show such character through purely visual imagery, not unlike WALL-E.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The game features 2D isometric combat not unlike Supergiant Games and action RPGs, and with a tight combat loop of attack, dash, and a variety of abilities such as chain dash, dash attack, and charge attack. There are also light platforming challenges as you dash through areas with gaps. Enemy and boss designs are decent. Collectibles include a Gearbit currency for upgrades, Modules which enable progression in a quadrant toward its boss and pillar, and Monoliths for the Librarian sidequest.\n\nLevels are semi-linear sometimes with forking paths. Hidden areas reward collectibles and are on the beaten path. The death penalty is forgiving with checkpoints appearing at the beginning for every level transition compared to Dark Souls-style checkpoints.\n\nControls are simple and intuitive. Movement, sword attack, dash, interact, aim and shoot, heal, and special. Tha game's movement and action speed is more deliberate than, say, Hades or Hollow Knight. The health and ammo involve singular quantities.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The pixel graphics are one of Hyper Light Drifter's greatest strengths. The abstract art with sumptuous colors, served alongside a moody soundtrack, are immersive.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Chain dash. It feels real good to move all speedy fast and time the chain.\n+ You can't fall off by running off the edge. Given all the areas have no guards, this is a big quality of life feature.\n+ No missable items, allowing you to backtrack to collect any missed Gearbits.\n+ You don't get hit from just touching an enemy. I hate that quirk in games.\n+ The shooting details like bullet dropoff when you're sniping (with a HUD determining the distance of a shot as well as grid to determine the bullet drop). Or bullet traversal instead of hitscan at long ranges. Or weapon sway when you're scoped in.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ The four shard door is actually an 8 shard door. Bad visual design.\n+ Secrets aren't consistently visually clear. You often just need to run on the edges to see if you can traverse through an obstacle, as trees for example just obscure your view.\n+ Reset pattern is weird. An entire dungeon is reset, not just the enemy respawn, whenever you warp. But enemies don't respawn when you only run back to town.\n+ The stunlocks from the center boss are ridiculous. It's either beat at full HP or get hit once and immediately die. Fortunately the shotgun is so OP at doing 5 damage at point-blank.\n+ The game randomly unreadies you from queue.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Abilities and Upgrades](https://hyperlightdrifter.fandom.com/wiki/Abilities_and_Upgrades)\n\nI was originally motivated to play because of its similar controls and combat as Hades and Hollow Knight, which I adore.

    "comments": "Hollow Knight is the best metroidvania of all time, combining elements from classics like Castlevania and Metroid with the deep combat of the soulslike genre. The platforming elements are also excellent. Both combat and platforming are difficult but fair alongside titans of its genres like Super Meat Boy and Celeste.\n\nFlaw-wise, Hollow Knight inherits one of the worst elements of Dark Souls: several long corpse runs. Fortunately, I found the game not too difficult as I was acquainted with 2D metroidvania combat before playing Hollow Knight, and Dreamgate is featured late game. Backtracking in Hollow Knight can be a pain, and it's easy to get lost on where to go next given all the interaction of areas. In terms of replayability, Hollow Knight also doesn't have any build variety like other metroidvanias with RPG elements.\n\n__Story.__ Hollow Knight inherits Dark Souls' diegetic style. There are NPCs percolated through the game with cryptic messages and which progress their content. Slowly areas unlock and the overarching story is revealed.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The core gameplay loop is one of soulslike and metroidvania games, searching through a new area, defeating enemies, finding the next checkpoint, and unlocking new abilities to progress to the next area. Enemy variety is excellent, particularly with 53(!) bosses and each with up to 3 variations. There's also a good amount of platforming challenges. Particularly new mechanics include:\n\n1. The soul mechanic as mana is excellent, encouraging aggressiveness by attacking to refill it like Bloodborne while with a variety of spells including healing that benefit from such mana.\n2. There are mapping tools which help balance blind exploration and blindly following a map. In particular, the map isn't updated until you rest and purchase a map for a given area. It also serves as the early purchases with your geo (the currency), where these quality-of-changes are enabled over time.\n3. Additional mechanics include multiple fast travel systems (including Dreamgate to set your own waypoint), Spells which serve for both combat and unlocking areas, Nail Arts, Warrior Graves, and Whispering Roots.\n\nThe map and unlockable powers is metroidvania-like. It's extremely open in what areas are open to explore. And unlike Souls games, there aren't general levels for each area, with the only major progression missing being your Nail upgrade. For example, there are so many paths to explore after City of Tears.\n\nThe death penalty is soulslike with a return to a spawn point and defeating an enemy to reobtain lost geo. This encourages the classic risk-exploration tradeoff in whether to return back to your spawn point to replenish heals and save your geo or to venture forth hoping you'll find the next checkpoint.\n\nControls are responsive and feature a minimal and intuitive moveset. Movement is precise without acceleration and where dash arrests cetical movement reminiscent of Megaman games. Jump is Castlevania-like in holding it to jump higher, alongside unlocked abilities. Attacking enemies with attack and dodge, with directional attacks like pogo sticking enemies from the downward strike and upwards strike.\n\nProgression-wise, there aren't stats like Castlevania or Dark Souls. Rather powers unlock in Metroid style, charms as a light form of equipment, and with upgrade items: Mask Shards to upgrade max HP, Vessel Fragments to upgrade max Soul, and Grub and Essence rewards.\n\nReplayability is somewhat limited. Steel Soul mode is the only variation on a second playthrough. Endgame, there is plenty of content at least to continually test your mettle. The Grimm Troupe and Godmaster DLCs are integrated well into the game and serve as challenging endgame content alongside Trial of the Coliseum and White Palace.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Beautiful art style with tight animations on movesets and getting hit or hitting. The atmosphere and overall soundtrack is also great.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ The spawn enemy mechanic as the way to recover Geo, and which appear before a boss encounter if you die at one. I greatly prefer this over Dark Souls' approach of picking up a corpse during the boss fight.\n+ Unlike Dark Souls, you can't accidentally hit NPCs.\n+ Sometimes when you rest on a bench, there's an NPC resting on it too.\n+ To unlock Charm Notches, you must unlock a certain number of Charms. This encourages widespread spending so you actually purchase everything.\n+ No missable content. Nothing like the opaque NPC quest objectives in Dark Souls that are easy to miss.\n+ Hornet's yells during each attack reminds me of Megaman boss battles.\n+ Collector's Map is available late game so you can track all the remaining Grubs. By the time I got it, I only needed 6 more.\n+ White Palace is a nice approach to endgame content focusing on platforming challenges where other endgame content can serve as combat challenges.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Pantheon of Hallownest is by far one of the most challenging content in video games. It's somewhat bullshit because it's just a marathon lineup of all 53 bosses in the game. With that said, it's optional. You can even practice on individual bosses via the Hall of Gods.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Parry mechanic isn't well-telegraphed or rewarding, so it's not core to the combat. For example, there's no riposte.\n+ To teleport back to the latest checkpoint, there's no consumable item like Homeward Bone. You just Quit to Menu. There should be an ingame approach to do this as backtracking is tedious.\n+ There are no regular enemies that pose a significant threat akin to Black Knights in Dark Souls. Regular enemies are more for chip damage and where you can be suddenly low only if youâre careless in fighting too many at once or over environmental hazards.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Short progression guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/5whg5n/a_short_progression_guide_with_movement_ability)\n+ [Charm Tier List](https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/8vpya9/hollow_knight_charm_tier_list)\n+ [112% completion checklist](https://hollowknightchecklist.com)\n\nI played the game with all four content packs, leaving the two content DLCs of Grimm Troupe and Godmaster as postgame content. I originally played it on Mac on 09/15/18. I couldn't get into 2D soulslike combat and metroidvania at the time. It's interesting just how much a difference in perspective affects things. I completed effectively all content, with 110% completion including Path of Pain and Nightmare King Grimm. The only things I didn't do are Pantheon of the Knight, Pantheon of Hallownest, Pantheon bindings, all Radiant bosses, Steel Soul mode, and Speedrun achievements.\n\n+ Charm-wise, I use Long Nail (later Mark of Pride), Quick Focus, and Grubsong. Later, I add Quick Slash, and at 11 Charm Notches, my loadout is Unbreakable Strength, Mark of Pride, Quick Focus, and Sharp Shadow, the last of which is situationally swapped with Grubsong and Thorns of Agony.\n+ Geo-wise, I found the game well-balanced: by the time I got all 3 Dreamers, I had enough for the everything plus 10k geo, with only the purchases remaining of the three Divine upgrades and Salubra's Blessing.\n\n__Path of Pain.__ It took me roughly 5 hours to beat Path of Pain, with 3.5 hours spent alone on the final segment (beating my head against the wall repeatedly for the hardest piece of it, where I could do every other part of the segment consistently). What an accomplishment but also what suffering to get there. My thumb is even sore for having to press A/B (particularly in timing the hold-A jump). I found the platforming quite fair overall, with the more challenging segments like the first section quite fun and reminding me of Super Meat Boy and Celeste. It's the bullshit portion of the final section that I had to beat my head against the wall for.\n\n__Nightmare King Grim.__ I beat it after roughly 3 hours. Once you learn his moves and don't die within seconds of the fight, the fight plays like a fun reflex game. You know exactly how to react to each move, punish, and/or heal. It's all a matter of executing it over the course of roughly 49 hits, practicing over dozens of runs until you can commit each reaction as instantaneous muscle memory.

    "comments": "Salt and Sanctuary stands out among soulslike games by executing all the important elements well, and with the 2D design to keep things sufficiently interesting. It's shamelessly a Dark Souls clone in copying even minute details, but it doesn't detract from how fun the game is itself. As a 2D metroidvania with unlockable powers, it also borders on the line of Castlevania.\n\nFlaw-wise, there are few. I found the overall difficulty too easy. This is partially attributed to game imbalance where certain builds are drastically better than others, with other options or items being nonviable. For example, heavy armor is not really worth the sacrifices in movement speed, dodge roll, and investments in the willpower stat. Part of this is also attributed to the enemy and boss movesets not being that difficult to master. There's only so much you can do in 2D compared to 3D combat.\n\n__Story.__ Opaque like usual for Dark Souls.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Game is truly a 2D Dark Souls, including enemy movesets, player stats and equipment, core controls, bonfires, HP and stamina bar, Salt currency to level up, Red flask as replenishable heal consumables, real-time menus without any pausing, and metroidvania level design. Even minute details are emulated like the status effect bars and opaque messages on the ground. Game is faster paced than a typical Dark Souls game with abilities like Jump and Attack taking not nearly as much stamina as in Dark Souls 1, and with movement speed overall faster.\n\nIn terms of new elements, Salt and Sanctuary introduces the Tree of Skill. Leveling up provides you Black Pearls which you then spend in the Skill Tree to gain stats, ability to equip items, or increase potion capacity. Salt and Sanctuary also introduces Brands which provide key abilities to access different areas and events in the game. Other changes are somewhat minor:\n\n+ Creeds are the equivalent of covenants, but with more single player effects instead of a multiplayer interaction. This includes merchant offerings and rewards as you rank up in the Creed. Sanctuaries each have an associated Creed which determines whether you can access the merchants there, and you can convert a Creed by using a limited item or desecrate it by fighting the NPCs and enemy waves.\n+ Offerings allow you to unlock merchants and servants inside Sanctuaries.\n+ Death is like Bloodborne where all salt is absorbed by the nearest enemy and which must be defeated without the player dying for the salt to be reimbursed. If there's no nearby enemy, the game spawns one.\n\nThe Offering mechanic is poorly designed. You place them in specific Sanctuaries, which suggests merchants obtained from offerings require backtracking. However, you can place Stone Guides at any Sanctuary which then lets you warp to any other Sanctuary. This means the strategy is to just put as many offerings as possible (up to 4 total) in Sanctuaries each with a Stone Guide: one cluster of Alchemist, Blacksmith, and Merchant; and another with Leader to rank up a Creed, Mage or Cleric if your build uses it, and Sellsword if you play online. In doing so, you effectively have a hub accessible with one use of Calling Horn and where each Sanctuary can be warped to the next to access each merchant. It's overly complicated for a simple outcome: why not just enable a hub and allow merchants that are slowly enabled over time?\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Love the slightly cartoonish sprites with a grunge setting. The outfits aren't really suitable for Fashion Souls unfortunately. The atmosphere and lighting serve wonders. No voice acting unfortunately.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ You only need to take about 30% or so of the a boss' HP to get your your Salt back. This helps with the issue of losing Salt when dying repeatedly to a boss.\n+ Unlike Dark Souls, you can't accidentally attack and therefore aggro NPCs.\n+ Bosses are all close to a shrine or sanctuary.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ There's a distinction between shrines and sanctuaries, where shrines may serve as midway points in areas and don't let you level up.\n+ No map. Obviously inherited from Dark Souls, although map complexity is a lot more difficult to handle in a 2D game.\n+ Heals heal more slowly than the more instantaneous heals in Dark Souls.\n+ Rings don't stack. Similar to Dark Souls.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Fuck Hagers Cavern. Boss is not close to a shrine or sanctuary. It's so easy to fall to your death.\n+ Gold is a separate currency from Salt which you use to purchase vendor items and as a respawn penalty. I rarely find it needed and just spend gold on salt pouches and the occasional splurge on upgrade items if I chance on upon that vendor.\n+ No sprint.\n+ No hard respec. There are only Grey Pearls to refund a certain number of Skill Points.\n+ Item notification pickups appear in a corner. I prefer Dark Souls' approach of making it front and center as I often pick something up and don't even know what I picked up.\n+ No plunge attack or ladder attack.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [New Player Guide/FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/saltandsanctuary/comments/4c6fcy/new_player_guidefaq)\n+ [Builds Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/saltandsanctuary/comments/4e1rif/builds_guide)\n+ [Heavy Armor Ain't Shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/saltandsanctuary/comments/5ni5xp/heavy_armor_aint_shit_comparative_analysis)\n+ [When should I be upgrading/transmuting?](https://www.reddit.com/r/saltandsanctuary/comments/6lo7ug/when_should_i_be_upgradingtransmuting_stuff)\n+ [Wiki](https://saltandsanctuary.wiki.fextralife.com)\n\nI did a pure strength build as it like seemed most designed class in the game.

    "comments": "Fun roguelike with 2D combat and platforming. It pushes most on the persistent elements of roguelites, where most of the game's fun zone is derived in farming areas for gold to permanently upgrade your character. There are only a handful of bosses and enemy variety is decent but not stellar as they see much reuse. There's not enough randomization across runs or engaging combat mechanics.\n\n__Story.__ There's a certain humor in Rogue Legacy due to all its references, adding to a certain charm. For example, your heirs can inherit a baldness trait, which has no gameplay effect. Or heirs which have dyslexia.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The game reminds me a lot of a Dead Cells predecessor, building inspiration from Castlevania and roguelike elements. Controls are tight, but the moveset is restricted without a duck, dodge, block/parry, or angular attack.\n\nRandomness in runs mostly comes from the level design, where the change in starting class doesn't have much real effect and there aren't much random items, equipment, or stat upgrades within a run. You use gold you accumulated over the run for upgrades, equipment, and runes.\n\nThere's just four main areas.\n\nThe game is fairly grindy as a roguelite. The gameplay loop involves searching around areas to farm gold to improve your permanent stats for the next run and discover blueprints. After accumulating sufficient stats, the only other portion of the gameplay loop is to fight bosses, turning on the architect to fix the level placement.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ It has a charming pixel style. It's also nice to see equipment affecting the player cosmetics.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ The idea of new runs being your next heir is cute.\n+ Teleporter to the next area after beating the boss in the previous. This helps with the redundancy in having to trek through the Castle each time. You're still incentivized to go through previous areas for gold farm runs, but you're no longer forced to.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ N/A\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Each level you gain increases the cost of all upgrades by 10 gold. I find this just increases the grind by making all upgrades more expensive.\n+ Touching enemies hurts you. Cheap mechanic.\n+ Highest resolution for the art assets is 1920x1200. [You can apparently hardcode it in the config text file to higher](https://steamcommunity.com/app/241600/discussions/0/846957366711894275), but it only rescales the resolution instead of increasing its native resolution.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n[Upgrades](https://roguelegacy-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Upgrades)",

It excels most as an engine builder, relying on the addictive nature of progressively unlocking the story and power creep than a precisely addictive gameplay loop like other roguelike titans. The combat work well with tight controls and well-designed enemies and levels. Boons are balanced and enable high build variety. The high amount of progression mechanics motivate the next run and add further challenges. \n\n__Story.__ Hades is one of the few roguelikes with a decent story. It's a basic one, but I like how the story takes advantage of the ensemble cast of Greek mythology. The dialogue lines percolated throughout runs is particularly good.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The core roguelite mechanics are all excellent: the random power ups, level designs, enemies and bosses, weapon movesets, and merchants. The isometric combat is not unlike Bastion and Transistor, but improved most in terms of the system mechanics with all the roguelike elements. There's a good variety in the randomization, and a surprising amount of viable builds as well as balanced abilities.\n\nThere's a good amount of progression shared across runs via currencies, story progression, and additional difficulties. Charon's Obol provides per-run gold currency. Nectar and Ambrosia provide gifts for characters which increases their bond and gives you a keepsake. Darkness provides permanent upgrades, and Keys unlock upgrade options and weapons. Gemstones and Diamonds repair the Underworld adding new furnishings. Titan Blood upgrades weapons.\n\nThe endgame after you complete a run has high replayability. Story keeps appearing until the main ending after 10 completed runs. Heats amp up the difficulty with new mechanics (including new boss attacks), with the reward of a bount which may be a Diamond, Amborisa, or Titan Blood. You also get a bounty for each weapon per heat, as well as Dark Thirst applied to a random weapon every run, encouraging you to play all weapons. After enough runs, you start delving into weapon Aspects and Companions, which add additional movesets. In fact, while weapon aspects are passive, they make Special usage viable so your playstyle isn't just spamming Dash and Attack: for example Chiron Bow's Attack -> Special for homing; and Zeus Shield's Special to zip around the map.\n\nReplayability is good but ultimately not as high as the roguelike titans of the genre. Boons combos, levels, and enemies all start to feel same-y after a while as you've beaten the game after, say, 10 runs and unlocked near everything. Compare to, say, Binding of Isaac or Dead Cells where the game really only begins when you've completed multiple run.\n\nControls are tight and responsive.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Follows the iconic style of other Supergiant Games.

    "comments": "Stalker SOC is a semi-open world survival FPS, uniquely combining elements of each of these genres to form its vision of a Ukranian nuclear nightmare. It builds a tense atmosphere with palpable combat: shooting enemies feels immersive with its realistic constraints; there are diverse enemy designs across human stalkers, creatures, and environmental hazards; scripted combat scenarios; and inventory management as you deliberate on your loadout and loot. Every encounter is deadly as you can die from one shot.\n\nFlaw-wise, early game is a shit show until you obtain a scope in Dark Valley, as you can unload a full clip at an enemy point blank and miss every shot. The difference with later weapons is significant. Side quests are also forgettable, with little incentive to explore beyond the main quest objective paths. Finally, although I didn't find this hampered my experience, the game is clearly unpolished with janky AI and numerous bugs.\n\n__Story.__ Stalker's worldbuilding is its most interesting lore due to its unique setting of stalkers, artifacts, and human-experimented creatures as the aftermath of a nuclear war. The main story is serviceable in its progression but characters are largely forgettable.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Stalker's core gameplay loop is to find cover, low crouch, use iron sights or scope, and then take controlled pot shots in semi-auto mode from medium to long range, ideally hitting the head for instant kills. There are not only enemies in the form of human stalkers and creatures but also environmental hazards known as anomalies. Further, there's emergent AI behavior: creatures may ambush you as you loot; human enemies fight creature enemies. Unfortunately, enemies are bullet sponges, so it can be difficult to know if your shots which already have bad aim early game to even hit your target.\n\nThe inventory system makes you deliberate about your loadout before setting off and as you loot enemies: there's a carry capacity which affects running endurance and you can only carry a handful of weapons at a time alongside health consumables. I love this idea in FPS games. Weapons include an item condition and can even be modded with attachable scopes. Artifacts serve as a form of equipment, including a body armor. Like an RPG, there are weapons and armor of each type that are strictly better in terms of damage and accuracy as you progress through the game. There are traders, dialogue with NPCs including a simple notion of reputation which affects trade discounts. Meters feature stamina, health, and armor, and where consumables must be used in real-time to more quickly gain back any meters. Icons for status effects include hunger, radiation, and bleeding. Day night cycle.\n\nControls are simple and intuitive, borrowed from most FPS with sprint and crouch. Stalker also incorporates a double-crouch which drops your noise to zero and maximizes shooting accuracy, lean left and right, change firing mode, and quick bandage and medkit. There are additional utilities like flashlight and nightvision goggles.\n\nSide quest quality is infinite and not worth doing. Similar to Fallout 3 side quests, I'm strongly in favor of fewer and higher-quality quests, not this style of radiant quests. In addition to having formulaic objectives, they serve little to no story or worldbuilding. Ultimately, while it's an open world, the areas are largely bare, which is realistic, but this means there's some but not much incentive to explore. Instead, go from point A to point B for the main quests while sauntering if you see a nearby building or corpse.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The dirty graphics remind me of a dated Metro 2033. It feels immersive even in 2021 with only the face models appearing particularly dated. The lip syncing is horribly bad. Dialogue is only partially voiced.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ The minimap. It includes all quest objectives, including side quests outside the main one you're tracking, allied and neutral NPCs, and generally points of interest. Makes it significantly juggle multiple quests simultaneously.\n+ Weapons have dropoff.\n+ You have to withdraw your weapon before speaking to NPCs.\n+ You can sprint while reloading.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Aim is incredibly bad, to the point that weapons like the pistol veer so much they're near useless. I much prefer a more challenging system that doesn't make your shots just RNG. Fortunately in mid to late game, weapons have much better accuracy and use a scope for their iron sight which do not nearly feature as bad aim.\n+ The map is a hassle to navigate.\n+ Currency is all but meaningless. There's not much to buy from traders beyond ammo.\n+ No subtitles.\n+ In dialogue choices, you can't press a keyboard shortcut with the numbers like Elder Scrolls games.\n+ Sensitivity is way too high even at its lowest setting. To reach my Overwatch settings of roughly 8.5in/180, I have to toggle my DPI from 800 to 400 which is annoying for navigating menus. To avoid this hassle, I resorted to [Cheat Engine](https://steamcommunity.com/app/4500/discussions/0/2183537632746786166) to go below the minimum limit of 0.05 to 0.023.

The core metroidvania elements are there with level navigation, ability and key gating, and manual saving.\n\nCombat is Ori's weakest element. It's a passive system where you just stand in proximity of an enemy and spam your auto-aim Spirit projectiles. The enemies' various attacks keep this somewhat engaging as you have to dodge, but it's a significantly streamlined system compared to a deeper combat system where you have to aim and time your attacks, have status effects or stagger your enemy, and more. The combat is like an even more streamlined Metroid experience where you still rely on attack spam but now you also no longer need to aim or manage attack type ammunitions.\n\nOri introduces the Soul Kindle mechanic as a limited save consumable to determine your own checkpoints. Fortunately, there is less incentive to hoard as the Energy meter has a maximum limit, and there's plentiful resource to save for less than 30 second intervals, which is particularly useful given all the platforming instant-death challenges. With that said, it still encourages a conservative gameplay where you'd only use your saves when you otherwise are at the max and can obtain new ammo, or you're in desperation. The game is even slightly imbalanced for this as it must encourage instant-death given that you can respawn anywhere.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The game is artistically beautiful with a watercolored style, unique bestiary, and a wonderful orchestral soundtrack.

Aria of Sorrow stays challenging all the way through, and with a streamlined set of mechanics that all work well.\n\nFlaw-wise, my only gripe is that the combat with a limited player and enemy moveset and enemies don't make it as deep as titles that would come later (c.f. Hollow Knight and Dark Souls). Yet it ages well for such an old game. Soma as a character is also not nearly as interesting due to his generic high school shoe-in role without the legacy other characters have.\n\n__Story.__ There are more mini cutscenes than SOTN, and I think it works to the better as SOTN's story was surface thin. Here, the cutscenes (in addition to bosses) make you feel like you're progressing through the main story and without hampering any gameplay momentum.\n\n__Gameplay.__ All the polished and streamlining from SOTN is for the better. Instead of 8 equipment slots, sub weapons (including an extra meter of hearts to count), spells, familiars, and consumables, there are now just 3 equipment slots of weapon, armor, and accessory, and 3 power slots of two active and one passive. This makes the powers actually viable: for example, Bat provides an omnidirectional attack that's useful for low HP flying critters; Flying Armor lets you glide for jumping over slightly wider platform gaps. Aria of Sorrow also introduces a souls system where you collect monster souls.\n\nOn top of streamlining, Aria of Sorrow also includes several notable improvements. For example, weapons feature more variety in their movesets, where whip swords have an extendable range and broadswords do a vertical sweeping instead of the typical horizontal stab. A shop is readily accessible from the beginning. Boss areas are explicitly marked so you know whether to look for a Save Room before trekking in with low HP. Enemy variety remains excelletn as always and with only a handful of palette swaps.\n\nThe core controls remain the same with an attack (with different directions), jump, backdash, and map and menu button.\n\nCombat in Castlevania titles ages well as an engaging affair decades later. However, you can also appreciate just how much games like Dark Souls and Hollow Knight have advanced since then. In Castlevania, it's typically a strategy of attacking an enemy until they start their attack, then moving out of range until it's over with backdash or jump, then repeat. Strategy changes due to positioning and aiming. These improved titles introduce regular vs heavy attack, enemy stagger, parry and ripostes, dodging in any direction including through the enemy, Dark Souls' 3D letting you circle strafe, item usage which takes place in real-time which makes you vulnerable, Hollow Knight's downward swipe letting you attack and stay in the air, and with much more variety in both weapon and enemy movesets.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Graphics are like a more colorful and lower resolution SOTN. The pixellation on all the menus for GBA doesn't age well, and I greatly prefer SOTN's graphics. It's also a shame there's no voice acting. The soundtrack is excellent.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Items can now be used (via menu) rather than equipped and then used. Unlike SOTN, this made me actually use them.\n+ Unlike Dark Souls and Hollow Knight, Aria of Sorrow has no lengthy corpse runs to boss fights.\n+ Unlike SOTN, it's always fairly easy to know where to go next with the newly gained ability.\n+ Castle entrance is designed in the same layout and enemies as SOTN.\n+ You can select the specific Warp Room to go to instead of cycling through them.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ The game doesn't tell you the controls, similar to SOTN. It's easy to look up but annoying it's not embedded in the game.\n+ No Save Room next to a Warp Room. This makes Warp Rooms a slightly more tedious Save Room if you want to make the trek.",

    "comments": "Zero Mission is a definitive remake of the original, wiping away many of the original's more tedious elements to make a polished and smooth experience.\n\nFlaw-wise, Zero Mission still features quite the amount of annoying backtracking, and the explicit objective markers in Zero Mission show just how many redundant areas you have to traverse. Zero Mission significantly reduces the amount of confusing parts of where to go next, but you can still get stuck once in a while.\n\n__Gameplay.__ I greatly enjoy Zero Mission's quality of life improvements, which without make the original NES game arguably unplayable. For example: there is a map including save rooms and map rooms; objective markers and slightly more linear level design making the game less confusing to wander; you can crouch and shoot as well as shoot diagonally (including while standing still with shoulder buttons similar to Super Metroid), making fighting enemies more approachable; and movement speed and shooting is faster (borrowing from Metroid Fusion); and objective completion leads to a recharge of enemy levels.\n\nLevels are somewhat mazelike, with many secret bottom corridors and walls to break. The unlocking of powers to get to new areas is somewhat intuitive with the great help of the objective marker. In the original Metroid, there are no Save Rooms, and Zero Mission also doesn't include Warp Rooms like Castlevania SOTN.\n\nAll of Samus' unlocked powers naturally increases your moveset, and it all feels like natural upgrades. Samus' attacks are unique for an action platformer, and playing in 2021, you can still feel its originality: for example, the Beam and its upgrades like Ice Beam and Warp Beam, Morph Ball and its Bombs, and Missiles. They can even be used in [pretty cool combinations](https://metroid.fandom.com/wiki/Special_Actions) such as bomb jumping.\n\nUnlike Castlevania SOTN, there are no RPG mechanics with leveling and equipment. And Zero Mission significantly benefits without them as there's no imbalanced difficulty curve and no need for grinding. Combat itself is fairly spammy---just point in the right direction---so there's less interesting strategy here compared to the timing and positioning of attacks in Castlevania. Instead, the unlocked powers serve as permanent upgrades which go beyond stat increases, and like Castlevania SOTN, you still get health/mana (in Metroid, missile) capacity increases.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Zero Mission inherits the NES' iconic soundtrack. The updated graphics are much appreciated, with 16-bit sprites more reminiscent of Super Metroid, and with the pixellation carrying a signature Gameboy Advance look.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI played as it's a remake of the original with improved quality of life features like a map, gameplay, and graphics. I played on the mGBA emulator.\n\nI played on Normal difficulty. Given the remake's quality of life additions, I played blind and avoided savescumming.",

    "comments": "SOTN started the metroidvania genre, building tropes used in modern platformers, action-adventures, and metroidvanias. The art direction and sountrack is astounding. Moreover, played in 2021, the gameplay holds surprisingly well: combat is engaging with tight controls, enemies have unique and diverse designs, and levels encourage a decent amount of exploration.\n\nSOTN is [not without flaws](https://www.reddit.com/r/castlevania/comments/7s6cky/comment/dt2bxzf). First, SOTN has a poor difficulty curve largely because the RPG elements are imbalanced: in early game, every enemy can kill you and the gauntlet in Royal Chapel is a prime example, feeling difficult but fair; but by midgame, enemies will often do 1-10 HP damage while you've accumulated 150+ HP from leveling, equipment, and permanent upgrades. Second, the inverted castle pads content with mostly redundant level design and bosses. Moreover, its traversal is tedious with the reliance on bat form to reach anywhere, and it's less interesting to explore since you already have all your powers. Third, SOTN's level design can feature long stretched hallways that's particularly annoying for a game that encourages backtracking. Fortunately, the various shortcuts and warp rooms significantly reduce this tedium. Fourth, while there are many weapons, there is little difference among most weapons. Rather than weapon choice taking into account the moveset involved, all weapons have the same moveset and itâs more a question of choosing the weapon with highest stats.\n\n__Story.__ Storytelling overall is serviceable. The lore is cheesy, reminiscent of Fist of the North Stars and Jojo which must have influenced the Castlevania series. SOTN's story is also sparsely presented, where cutscenes only appear a handful of times to not interrupt gameplay.\n\n__Gameplay.__ SOTN introduced to the series (and the world) the metroidvania style: an open world with nonlinear navigation. It's a significant departure from the \"Classicvania\" games, which are relatively linear games broken into levels ending with bosses. As a metroidvania, SOTN features Save Rooms, an alternative to automatic saves after a linear sequence of Stages in the previous non-metroidvania Castlevania titles, and warp rooms as an approach to fast travel. Levels are designed well and encourage exploration, with an intuitive map to determine where you haven't yet treked. It can be occasionally confusing to know where to go next now that you've unlocked an item, but it's easily resolvable by more exploration or referencing a walkthrough.\n\nIn terms of combat, SOTN features more fluid combat than its predecessors with a backdash and downward kick. Alucard can also use Magic Spells activated with specific button combinations, learn skills after discovering relics (including creature transformations), and enlist Familiars as a companion. All these mechanics with sub weapons, spells, and familiars add a little too much bloat and weren't quite packaged cohesively (familiars have very rare use cases, and I never felt compelled to use spells). The enemy design and variety is excellent.\n\nIn terms of system mechanics, SOTN is the first in the series to introduce RPG elements: levels from experience points which boost stats and equipment. Weapon types feature some diversity among weapons, where a short hand may slightly trade off range and a 2H trades off defense. There is an overall lack of build variety compared to other games like Dark Souls, and where SOTN's replayability relies primarily on different progression routes you might take instead of changes to combat. Difficulty is surprisingly quite forgiving for such a classic game as by midgame you have plenty of HP and equipment upgrades relative to enemy stats, especially compared to early game where taking a single hit matters a lot.\n\nControls age well with a normal attack, crouch attack, and various ways to handle upwards attacks such as your sub weapon or jump attacks. The dash, core 3 meters of health, MP, and sub weapon candles, magic abilities all give a deep yet intuitive combat system. A simple map.\n\nPlaying this in 2021 for the first time, it's like a legacy Dark Souls in 2D. It has the same kind of character progression in stats. You trek to open areas, possibly going back to your Save Room to restore HP while enemies respawn. Every enemy is dangerous, and positioning is important. You find a new weapon and test its move set and damage. You fight a boss and memorize its attack patterns until you can do it perfectly in order to win. There's even secret walls that you hit for rewards.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The soundtrack is excellent. I'm always a fan of orchestral soundtracks, and SOTN's is iconic. The sprite graphics works well.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Some equipment like the Bloodstained Cloak are cosmetic. It actually affects your sprite, which is unheard of for PS1.\n+ Clock Tower has a hub where you pick up any sub-weapon.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ You have to equip item consumables by going into the menu in order to use them.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Controls](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Castlevania:_Symphony_of_the_Night/Controls)\n+ [Walkthrough](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Castlevania:_Symphony_of_the_Night/Walkthrough), [Walkthrough Checklist](https://guides.gamercorner.net/sotn/walkthrough)\n+ [Map](https://www.finalfantasykingdom.net/sotnmaps.php)\n\nI played the [English patch v1.0](http://www.romhacking.net/translations/1427) of the PS1 Japanese release (ISO v1.2). The official English release suffers from a B-quality dub and script. I used the PS1 emulator: Mednafen with Beetle PSX HW (the RetroArch fork of Mednafen, which adds a GUI). For setting up Retroarch, see what I did for Tenchu: Stealth Assassins.\n\nI played the game mostly blind and without any emulator savescumming. However, I did use a walkthrough to know where to go next as I frequently found myself just wasting time wandering the unexplored zones on my map. I beat the game including the Inverted Castle but did not go for maximum completion: my rate was 183.7%.",

    "comments": "SOMA is a thriller. The gameplay gets repetitive, like traversing areas in Half-Life but without the engaging FPS gameplay. Without the horror elements like Amnesia, I really only was motivated to play to experience the rest of the story and completionism. The story is quite good for a video game, with a great duo of characters and various existential questions in a scifi setting..\n\n__Story.__ The technological science fiction setting is a departure from Amnesia's western historical roots. It's noticeably more atmospheric---reminiscent of the later Alien: Isolation---rather than horrific and tense. The characters themselves and the overarching plot with an armageddon followed by an Ark of data stored humans is grim and well-portrayed. I also find it surprisingly realistic such as when your data is copied and you face the choice of killing your previous robot self as teleportation under the same being is just not possible. The themes can be rather on the nose at times, such as in the ending with the \"plot twist\" of a stranded Simon and Catherine.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Gameplay is similar to Amnesia and other horror games, where you navigate areas with mini puzzles and the occasional enemy. Stealth and enemy variety make it more game-y than horrific. Controls are simple and intuitive. You pick up items to venture access deeper areas and also see flashbacks to experience more lore.\n\nUnlike Amnesia, there are no limited items like candles or stress to handle. Adds to the less stressful experience albeit makes exploration less rewarding.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Like Amnesia, checkpoints are very generous. So once you die from an enemy, it's a bit less tense to know that you don't lost much progress.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ The setting is supposed to be underwater, but when you're in the ocean, you're just on the bottom floor and moving around as if it were low gravity.",

    "comments": "The Ancient Gods Part 1 adds three new levels, dense with the usual mix of platforming and areans that makes Doom Eternal levels so fun. TAG1 also introduces new enemies and the progression mechanic of Support Runes. The levels are great as difficult yet fair challenges; they can suffer at times from steep difficulty curves. The increased enemy variety mostly works for the better albeit is somewhat one-trick with the Microwave Beam being the only counter to Spirits and Blood Makyrs being invincible until applying heavy attacks.\n\nRegarding new enemies, Turrets and Blood Makyrs force you to be precise with your Precision Bolt / Ballista combo. Spirits force you to make more usage of your Plasma Rifle with its Microwave Beam (now making it viable and more notable as a stun for advancing enemies like Possessed Demons, Barons, Hell/Dread Knights, and Whiplashes). Whiplash Spectre makes things particularly devious. I also love that they threw away the Crucible so that only the BFG remains as the powerful limited-ammo weapon.\n\nThe music is fine. It's serviceable but unfortunatley no longer stands out as a defining element of the Doom revitalized titles. It's clearly a different artist than Mick Gordon, and Andrew Hulsholt's aims to replicate it just aren't good enough.\n\nPlaying Part One after I got more acquainted with the optimal quickswitch combos, you can really see the difficulty in Part One. While I felt it bordered on unfair with the amount they throw at you, I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge: I felt it was actually balanced for me, as the quickswitch combos toned an uneducated and potentially unfair playthrough with an engaging one. The difficulty spikes did feel awkward though.\n\nThe Super Gore Nest master level is perhaps the best collection of difficult fights, and without a crazy difficulty curve. It was incredibly hard throughout.",

    "comments": "Killing Floor 2 is a fun horde shooter. The game gets repetitive after a while, but it's fun for a casual experience and occasionally for deeper dives into the higher difficulties and with friends.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Shooting mechanics, enemy variety, and class (perk) variety are all solid. The progression system with XP to advance perks, and where difficulties are somewhat tied to level, works well. Prestige ranks and the many classes keeps the game replayable. Within a level, progression is based on economy management.\n\nLevels are varied although I find the idea of an arena with waves of hordes less interesting than the mission-based levels of Left 4 Dead 2, where you make progress through levels rather than move around an arena based on where the trader is. Boss variety is also lacking. Waves get repetitive, especially as it encourages camping. There should be more to switch up the waves such as Stand Your Ground objectives.\n\nCombat is heavily around headshots, and using various perk players to handle the majority of trash while others deal with heavy Zeds. Perk specializations range from trash killing, healer, tank, large zed specialist. Zeds have resistances and weaknesses, encouraging perks to specialize to certain zed types and know how to take down certain zeds (e.g., the legs for rioters, Husks' ranged fireballs). This adds combat depth. Advanced techniques include:\n\n+ Crouch reduces recoil and spread.\n+ Sprint backwards.\n+ Reload cancel, particularly for gunslingers.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Serviceable for a adrenaline-fueled horror shooter. Cosmetics add a degree of customizability.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Last enemies in a wave appear on screen so you can always find them.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ No crosshair as default, and with it on, the crosshair is pretty terrible.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Weapon despawning. If a teammate didn't pick up your weapon, it's up to a timer (so RNG) whether you can find where you died and pick it up in time to also visit the trader.\n+ Stand Your Ground offers too few rewards, is a deathtrap for higher difficulities from Suicidal, and isn't clearly noted that if teammates leave to be selfish and get remaining kills, the objective may no longer be met.\n+ No way to see how much damage you contributed to a boss. Leaderboard, although it doesn't matter given roles like tank and healer, is still imperfect in that it only shows kills, not say damage which can be important for tracking large Zed contributions.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ Class guides: [Commando](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=795952652), [SWAT](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885497234), [Gunslinger](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=874275491).",

    "comments": "DQ11 does little new. Rather, it stands the test of time by assembling all the great elements that make a classic JRPG under Dragon Quest's style: story and characters, turn-based combat, skill and equipment progression systems, level and enemy design, and visuals.\n\n__Story.__ It's a story told a million times, but it's the art, animations, soundtrack, and restraint knowing when to hold back in its tropes that make watching the story unfold so enjoyable. I also love all the various events occuring during towns, with scripted content, so that the cycle of town to dungeon to overworld to town is a theme but always different. For example, Gallopolis' spoiled prince trying to live up to his father's expectations and horse racing, and Octagonia's fighting tournament.\n\nThe detail of multiple acts---where Act 2 involves failure and rebuilding the party--- provides a nice opportunity for every party member to grow as they experience such strife. It reminds me of Final Fantasy 6. Gameplay-wise, you're also forced into new party compositions as you pick them back up which I greatly enjoy. There even mini training arcs in the good old-fashioned Dragon Ball style, and where characters unlock their full skill tree.\n\nSide quests are average, adding a tad to the overall world but are most often fetch quests.\n\nAct 3 drags on for longer than it should have, introducing a new cosmic enemy almost like a DLC. It adds unnecessary conflict to drag the story on and even reverts the characters' many conflicts and growths from Act 2, especially tragic characters like the mermaid, Miko, and Jasper. It does add more story to substantiate characters like Veronica and Mordegon so it doesn't feel like a complete afterthought, but the reuse of enemies and levels certainly makes it more repetitive. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed it treating it more like post-game with a lot of optional content.\n\n__Gameplay.__ There's something so brilliant about Dragon Quest's repeated use of classics in turn-based RPG and its style of JRPG with its universe of monsters, music, and story. Every Dragon Quest game you play feels nostalgic but also fresh with the new way you can enjoy enemy designs, a slightly new story with splendid characters, and more. It's like Pokemon this way.\n\nI really enjoy DQ's style: in-world roaming enemies, the standard level, magic, equipment, and party systems; horse and ship vehicles alongside spells like Zoom; general level navigation. DQ11 shows it really works well in a 3D environment as well. I even like some of its quirks: for example, you can attack an enemy in the world navigation as the approach to preemptive strikes, where they start with less HP; you visit a church to save, revive, or remove status effects; effectively unlimited inventory space with a max of 99 stacks per item; metal slimes as an approach to significantly reduce grind for endgame; mini medal collectibles; AoE attacks only hitting enemies of the same type; utility spells of Zoom and Evac; dying isn't game over but reloads you at a church with a gold penalty. New is a pepped up mechanic and monster mounts.\n\nMost new to DQ11's system is the Character Builder with skill points to allocate and the minigames like gambling, crafting, and horse racing.\n\nI love the forge system. In this game, forging is a crucial element thatâs useful for all equipment including drops with the help of the Rework mechanic. In addition many items being craft exclusive as you play through the game, and with the potential of already having bonuses. This makes crafting not some optional system to be ignored like in many RPGs. They also have an excellent balance between materials you can just purchase and materials you must farm.\n\nHUD and controls are excellent. Controls are simple with Contextual Action, Cancel/Jump, Sprint (and with a Horse in larger areas to move even faster), and menus. I love the simple HUD with just a minimap that's easy to open up, and menus like the map and equipment appearing in real-time. Even transitions to battles are fast so you don't feel impatient waiting for actions to occur. All the small additions to the minimap are just so nice contextually as well: for example, dots signifying previous steps you've taken in case you get disoriented, red markers for doors in towns that you can enter, the map reveals an objective if you get lost.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Akira Toriyama's character and monster designs shine as well as the brilliant cute animations and colorful scenery. The face models and general detail such as lighting is lacking a bit more than it should be, but it's still quite good. Soundtrack-wise, I'm partial to orchestral music, and Dragon Quest's iconic soundtrack with new renditions is excellent. The soundtrack is great in its mix of modern Dragon Quest and NES classics. But it's repetitive, lacking stay throughout the 70+ hour campaign. Dialogue is only partially voiced. The few loading screens make the game so much more enjoyable to play than older JRPGs like, say, Grandia where even entering a house in a town prompts a loading screen.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ No missables. This makes playing blind not only viable but encouraged unlike most JRPGs. Even side quests aren't missable as you have a quest catalogue tracking sidequests and noting locations of available ones.\n+ 2D mode. Cute perspective that you can try when you get bored of the game.\n+ Finally, a sprint feature in a JRPG?!\n+ You can set battle speed to Ultra-Fast, greatly speeding up the grind. You can even spam A to skip through battle text/animations making it a bit faster just like skipping through voiced text. And you can control the camera during fights.\n+ What to vendor is relatively straightforward: old equipment (any equipment needed in a recipe can't be sold anyways) and for items, Drasilian coins and potentially any overstocking of healing consumables.\n+ Questgivers are marked on the minimap but not quest objectives. I find this the perfect mix of streamlining, where they don't tell you everything but they at least give you enough so that you don't miss out on a quest because talking to all NPCs can be annoying and it's easy to miss one.\n+ They really nailed the artwork and flashy animations of the gambling minigames, especially Slime Time slots.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Like other DQ games, benched party members get the same XP. This means you pretty much main a party instead of cycling among them to distribute XP. At the least, I do like that it encourages less grind, and I swap out party members at my own leisure.\n+ It's cheap to respec.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ All the recycled levels in Act 3. It copy-pastes so many areas such as in Drustan's trials that it's tedious reexploring everything to find chests. I used a walkthrough.\n+ While there's a Jump, there are too many invisible barriers. For example, you can't even jump over fences.\n+ Weirdly, only some equipment affect cosmetics. I'd rather they do all or none. At least you can change cosmetics without changing your equipment with the Outfits option.\n+ Party dialogue. I love party dialogue and party banter especially as in Bioware games. However, the implementation is manual rather than spontaneously appearing as you roam, making it something you have to deliberately choose to do and which is easy to forget.\n+ For a game in 2017, DQ11 still suffers from the problem of color palette swaps in order to diversify enemy designs.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [DQXI Mostly Spoiler Free Step by Step Suggested Character Builds](https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/cvu9m5/dqxi_mostly_spoiler_free_step_by_step_suggested), [Skill Trees](https://www.neoseeker.com/dragon-quest-xi/Spoiler!)\n+ [Fun-size forge recipe book locations](https://dragon-quest.org/wiki/List_of_fun-size_forge_recipe_book_locations_in_Dragon_Quest_XI)\n+ [Stats](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/235919-dragon-quest-xi-echoes-of-an-elusive-age/faqs/76680/stats-and-their-functions)\n\nI played the Definitive Edition. [Tim Roger's review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iTbUGItU0s) is unnecessarily ranty but it freshly combines depth, hilarity in the reviewer's own antics and persona, and importantly, it captures difficult aspects of what makes a game so good. In particular, he explains what \"chilling\" in a game looks like, as well as what it means for an really well-established battle system could do.\n\nI played the game blind. I gave seeds arbitrarily to whomever party member is most lacking in the stat but often just Hero. I did a mix of hoarding gold until I saw an upgrade from crafting or a significant one from a vendor. I used guides to track collectibles like mini medals and Pastwords and optional content near endgame. I completed gambling, horse racing, all sidequests, The Wheel of Harma, and reconstructing Cobblestone. Although I even farmed to level 99 and optimized gear, I stopped after beating Calasmos. I didn't really care for Tickington, the final bonus boss Timewyrm, or Wheel of Harma's Secret Trial. Setups:\n\n+ __Challenging fights like bosses.__ I use Hero with Quadraslash, Sword Dance, and utility heals/revives; Jade with Pink Tornado, Multifeet, and Re-Vamp; Veronica for Kaboomle, Kafrizzle, Channel Anger, Oomphle; and Serena for Divine Restitution, Divine Intervention, Grace of the Goddess, Kabuff, Acceleratle, heals.\n\n    I found they all had pretty good use cases: Sylvando and Rab as more offensive support options (although Rab is outclassed by Sylvando in this role), Hendrik for great DPS with tank capabilities, and Erik for burst damage and steal (although I found his burst potential unreliable due to both RNG and certain enemies being immune to the required status effect, and he lacks AoE).\n+ __Rare drop farming.__ I use Jade with Uniforme Chic de l'Academie (2%); Erik with Vest for Success (1%) and Pirate King's Pendant (5%), Serena with Uniformes Chic de l'Academie (2%), and Veronica with Uniformes Chic de l'Academie (2%). With 7 equipped Bunny Tails (1%), this is a total of 19% drop rate. I preferred static drop rates so you can do consistent grinding rather than following a procedure to get up to a Pep Power like Hallelujah or Itemized Kill. For rare enemy farming, I use Circle of Serendipity (2%) and Wings of Serendipity (3%). For steal-only farming, I equip two Robber Gloves (5% each) and Swindler King's Scarf (6%).\n+ __General navigation.__ I stuck with the rare drop party composition and only swapped Jade's accessories with Belle's Bow and Supplicant to improve mana sustain. The party is powerful enough and I could still get rare drops or steal.\n+ __[Level grinding](https://www.neoseeker.com/dragon-quest-xi/The_Wheel_of_Harma:_Fifth_Trial).__ I did the pep power trick. Endgame is balanced for roughly level 70s, so max level is already easy enough; I didn't go to the effort of farming seeds which just breaks the game.\n+ __Gambling.__ My roulette strategy was like in DQ8: to put all chips on [13-24+chest and savescum](https://www.neoseeker.com/dragon-quest-xi/Off_the_Beaten_Path:_Part_2). This spends 112K with a payout of 270K or 342K if it lands on 13-24 according to the edge or direct center, treasure if it lands on chest, or savescum otherwise.\n+ __[Crafting](https://www.neoseeker.com/dragon-quest-xi/Fun-Size_Forge).__ I use Sizzly Puff 2-4 times, then spam Multibash, then fill individual gauges with the finer techniques.

    "comments": "The coop experience is superb---even with randoms---ranking among the best of games like Left 4 Dead 2 and Killing Floor 2. The community is one of Deep Rock Galactic's best assets due to their overall friendliness, including to greenbeards. The core gameplay loop is fun with mining, resource management, and gunplay. With many mission types, difficulty levels, and an arsenal of progression systems and cosmetics, Deep Rock Galactic is a a blast to play casually.\n\nFlaw-wise, it doesn't feature very deep gameplay, particularly lacking in enemy variety as most enemies are just spiders that run at you. I also only really enjoyed the Scout class as I felt while the others had interesting mechanics such as platforms and drilling, they lacked a lot of mobility which made the gameplay in exploration much slower-paced compared to Scout.\n\n__Gameplay.__ It's objective-based with various mining and combat. The combat features a variety of playstyles, particularly encouraging coop. It's not quite as in-depth as modern shooters or games like Overwatch, particularly due to a limited enemy variety (both in design, e.g., not just spiders, and in enemy moveset). It's no surprise that the mining mission type is closest to the \"spirit\" of the game: a relaxing experience with friends as you go spelunking and that occasionally has the rush of adrenaline in staving off enemies.\n\nAssignments provide a canonical list of mission types to play through, each with quite the variety in objectives. There are also Deep Dives (and Elite Deep Dives) available after Promotion, serving as later endgame content where it is effectively 3 missions back-to-back. These Deep Dives refresh every week alongside Weekly Assignments.\n\nBuild variety includes class choice, perks, equipment loadouts, cosmetics, and during endgame, overclocks as an added weapon upgrade. Upgrade currencies are obtained through exploration and mission rewards, as well as specific accomplishments for perk points. You can further promote characters to unlock more cosmetics, similar to Call of Duty prestige ranks---enabling a nice badge that incentivizes you to keep playing. Since 2019 unfortunately, it doesn't do anything aside reset your level; I feel like also capping your weapon upgrades would at least making game progression more dynamic.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Quite good for an indie title. It particularly ages well as the blocky texture is a deliberate art style.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Rock and Stone! Something you can spam that's not annoying and inspires camradarie.\nThe hub, especially the bar and jukebox. It's a great way of encouraging camradarie through complete strangers, often without even text chat or voice chat.\n+ After a game ends, you're in a lobby with the people you just played with. Incentives keeping playing with them!\n+ Scout's grappling hook. Reminds me of Doom Eternal's meathook and Apex Legend's Pathfinder which greatly improves movement capabilities. Here, you can use it for example to: climb vertically (particularly synergizes well with Engineer's floors so you can comfortably mine wall resources), dodge away from enemies such as bosses that aggro, move faster horizontally, and hooking the floor in midair to prevent fall damage.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ You get the same XP whether you join a game late or at the beginning. It encourages a meta where you only join late games to maximize XP.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ N/A\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Scout build](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/j5omvm/optimal_build_loadout_for_scout)",

    "comments": "Grandia is a JRPG of the PlayStation 1 era playing to tropes and with a few new ideas for turn-based combat. It introduces weapon and magic leveling, encouraging moveset variety; and the IP gauge encouraging light strategy around both positioning and timing of attacks. Its story, characters, and overall RPG elements are decent but don't stand out. I enjoyed Grandia as a slightly more opinionated Dragon Quest title. Like other JRPGs, I just don't find the story compelling---it's like an average-to-good anime following tropes and told well enough to be marginally interesting---and the game is fairly grindy and long, where the complexity in combat doesn't increase enough to remain interesting.\n\n__Story.__ Fairly prototypical, filled with the tropes you'd expect of a JRPG. The especially adolescent characters turn me off a bit from the story, but I do find the overall storytelling decent enough as if it were a shounen anime. I did enjoy the revolving party members, and never where there was a need to manage leveling only a subset of your party members from all of them.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The turn-based combat uses all the essentials that make the system fun: equipment and level system, overworld-visible enemies, gold currency system. Unique to Grandia, party members level up weapon and magic types separately, each of which add a stat bonus and can gain you new skills. This encourages gameplay variety where you don't focus on the most powerful moves; there are also plenty save points that you can freely spend SP/MP. Unfortunately it adds to the grind and meta in how to best grind XP for each type, but I still enjoyed it overall.\n\nGrandia's combat is its most innovative aspect with a time scale known as the IP gauge. Positioning matters: one of the 4 core stats is AGI/MOV, taking up less time to reach an enemy before you attack it; and it affects AoE. Another is WIT/ACT which determines the IP gauge's fill speed. Attacking enemies also staggers down, slightly delaying the time before they can make an action. The normal attack Combo consists of 2x attacks and can do extra Counter damage if timed, Critical can cancel enemy attacks like a well-timed parry, you can Defend with Endure vs Evasion, and there are Tactics to automate farming gameplay.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ I like the 2D sprites in a 3D environment. The partially voiced dialogue is nice, at least there's some voice acting unlike most PlayStation 1 JRPGs.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Remaster enables Japanese audio.\n+ Surprisingly, Grandia features dialogue choices which I rarely if ever see in JRPGs. They don't affect the game much beyond the next few lines but it's nice having the illusion of choice.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ The camera's field of view. Level navigation is disorienting due to the narrow FOV, lack of minimap with only a compass and the occasional overview access points, and lack of camera control for vertical or zoom in/out. PlayStation 1 era graphics with mostly empty areas also doesn't help distinguish individual locations as they all look similar. I would play with a [maps guide](https://i-njoy.net/gd1e_top.html) but found this too tedious and also ruined a lot of the blind playthrough experience.\n+ Inventory system. Each character can only hold 12 items and you can only use items from each character. The realism is nice but it makes item management across characters tedious as opposed to a party inventory.\n+ Like other RPGs at its time, vendor menus can be annoying. Equipment comparisons don't note a party member's current equipment so you don't really know what is an upgrade and what stats are being traded off. You also can't mark items as trash to sell, so it takes some back-and-forth to memorize the set of weapons/armor that you no longer need to cycle for leveling.\n+ Missables, particularly good equipment, items, 3 optional dungeons, unrevisitable dungeons after certain story events. To enjoy a walkthrough-free blind playthrough, I only kept track of [mana eggs](https://grandia.fandom.com/wiki/Mana_Eggs).\n+ You can't skip dialogue during cutscenes to make it go by faster, or even pause it.\n+ Unfortunately no fast-forward combat like the Final Fantasy remasters to greatly speed up the grindy elements when you just auto-attack enemies.\n+ All the backtracking to exit dungeons.\n+ There are lots of roaming NPCs and extra houses in towns, but there's little point talking to them. It's rare you'll get a side quest, and none have good rewards.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Stats](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/197483-grandia/68547615)\n+ [Experience Farming Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/grandia/comments/g4uq8p/experience_farming_guide)\n\nI played the remastered edition on PC and using a controller. I spread out my seed stat boosts but mostly gave to Justin. I stopped playing the game at Zil Desert, roughly 3/4 of the way through the game. I felt I experienced everything and the story and gameplay wasn't interesting enough to continue.",

    "date_started": "5/16/21",
    "date_finished": "5/22/21",
    "comments": "Mass Effect 2 is quite the improvement as a sequel. It improves combat in several ways such as animations, ammo capacity, and tactical enemy health; streamlines away elements such as the inventory which was unnecessary in Mass Effect 1; improves galaxy map navigation (albeit still repetitive); and features a more immersive HUD. Overall, this makes the game a fun experience, standing out as one of the best action RPGs of all time.\n\nFlaw-wise, the shared cooldown limits ability usage and streamlined RPG elements limit build variety. Combat can get fairly monotonous by endgame when you've seen all the game has to offer. Mass Effect 2 also continues Mass Effect 1's lack of player agency, with few approaches to tackle missions like in immersive sims, and with sparse quests to give life to individual worlds favoring quantity over quality.\n\n__Story.__ I like the overall story, particularly in siding with the Cerberus organization. Mass Effect 2's companions are also more distinguished here, complemented by loyalty missions which not only add more depth to each squad member but also the overall world. For example, Mordin's quest expands on the dilemma with the genophage to stabilize Krogan population, otherwise leading to a genocide or total domination.  Grunt's expands on Krogan culture on the home planet of Tuchanka. Thane and Garrus' loyalty missions give C-Sec spotlight time. Tali's expands on Quarian military law. Their lack of input is still rather paltry compared to the Dragon Age series, especially Dragon Age 2. I love Mordin especially. Beyond his quirky cadence and fervent scientific thinking, he has a ton of hilarious quips (like singing).\n\n__Gameplay.__ The core gameplay is the same but with improvements across combat, progression systems, and the galaxy map overworld.\n\nCombat-wise, animations are much smoother making the move to take cover more seamless as well as shooting and new animations like vaulting. The new mechanic of reloading for ammo makes the game just a little less brainless which I greatly enjoy. There is also no manual heal or grenade consumable; you auto-heal.\n\nThe enemy health system is more tactical with armor, shields, and barriers, and with weapons and abilities being good at a subset of them. It makes for a rock paper scissors similar to Borderlands and Doom. I like this design because it forces you to be more aware of the enemy type and therefore to adjust the weapons and abilities youâll be using for the encounter. Playstyle is no longer just determined by weapon range. I hate the shared cooldown however. It limits ability variety.\n\nTalent tree is much more streamlined with much less diversity for different playstyles. I do like the addition of ammo types, which further the rock paper scissors tactics; but it's a shame we lose so many other talents. No equipment mods further limit diversity. On the plus, the inventory and loot is replaced with [upgrades](https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Upgrade_Guide), including new weapons, swappable armor, and permanent upgrades on weapons, shields, bio-amp, and more. I like that it makes for an actual use of spending credits and other resources throughout the game, and you can easily keep track on your Private Terminal. Mass Effect 2's lack of loot works to its strengths whereas it otherwise have subpar loot like Mass Effect 1 or be a looter shooter like Borderlands.\n\nMass Effect's galaxy map also has notable improvements. Galaxy systems finally notate quests in them as well as progress on planets you've explored. I also like the mini-RPG elements of fuel resources, probes, and ship upgrades. The planet scanning minigame for mining minerals is fairly tedious: [My strategy](https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Planet_Scanning#Scanning_Tips) is to only mine Rich planets, which helps curb this problem. The overall idea of more interactivity in planet exploration is quite good. Most notable is the mechanic of detecting and searching for anomalies, which provides an additional way to spontaneously generate sidequest content.\n\nThere's more variety in the minigames, which helps break the usual game flow: hacking, firewalker, killing pyjaks. Lair of the Shadow Broker has a chase scene. Arrival has a control mech scene.\n\nControls and HUD are mostly the same as Mass Effect 1, keeping what works well. Most significant, the HUD is even more immersive now which I greatly enjoy. Gone is the minimap radar, only appearing contextually. This combined with the lack of map in combat areas makes navigation far more immersive as you focus on your main camera to explore all corners.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Graphics are a notable improvement from Mass Effect 1. It's hard to tell with the Legendary Edition making general textures have equal parity across the titles. What's most noticeable are the more fluid animations, lighting, and less asset reuse.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Mass Effect Genesis. What a fun way to recap.\n+ Mass Effect 2 is among the modern RPGs that continues the CRPG trend of importing previous title's save game.\n+ Logs you pick up are audio-based. They're no longer text walls or things you just grab and ignore. You have to stay nearby to listen.\n+ You can respec.\n+ No more overlapping voices when skipping dialogue lines. Thank you!\n+ Hacking has more variety with a card flip memory, target code segment. Less cheesable than the previous title.\n+ No more lengthy elevators.\n+ Kelly is next to the Galaxy Map console and tells you whenever there are any new messages or if a squad member wants to speak with you. This is such a nice quality-of-life feature so you don't have to frequently check up on each squad member.\n+ The instanced-based loadouts mean you avoid having to spend time in the middle of combat managing loot or new levelups. I love how it keeps pacing.\n+ Like Mass Effect, there are no quest markers for objectives or questgivers. Areas are small enough that it's sufficient to explore.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Interrupt QTE. On one hand, it's QTE which is annoying. On the other hand, it's a nice way of injecting Paragon/Renegade choices during animated cutscenes and not just dialogue.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ No save file editor for changing your imported save. We'll get a mod for this, but I wish there were an official tool like Dragon Age Keep.\n+ Heavy weapons. While there's a lot of them, none stand out to a degree that you'd incorporate them in a regular playstyle. Their limited ammo further makes them nonviable.\n+ The formulaic way you acquire loyalty missions. Everyone's lining up for their turn for drama!\n+ I enjoyed the Lair of the Shadow Broker campaign. The base however is subpar with its time-constrained rewards. I just hacked my Windows' date to get the delivery shipment rewards.\n+ Zero companion banter. This makes for less camradarie.\n+ The sequencing required to do all loyalty missions while still saving your full crew, including squadmates.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI played the remaster Legendary Edition on PC which includes all DLC. [Manually turned off mouse acceleration.](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition) Like Mass Effect 1, I played on Veteran difficulty. I leaned toward Paragon. I completed all sidequests and got all upgrades.\n\nI played Infiltrator. I enjoy its aim-heavy high-damage playstyle, reminding me of Ana in Overwatch; and its ability to complement almost any squad composition. My playstyle is to go to cover and line headshot after headshot. I rarely need to send the squad or control their abilities.\n\n+ Talents: Assassination Cloak for movement and damage bonus, Incinerate Blast for AOE and armor, Heavy Disruptor Ammo for shields, Heavy Warp Ammo for barriers, and Assassin for burst passives.\n+ Weapons: Mantis/Widow sniper rifle. I swap to the Carnifex heavy pistol when out of ammo.\n+ Armor: Kuwashii Visor, Off-Hand Ammo Pack, and Stimulator Conduits are essential.",

    "comments": "Mass Effect is an action RPG that blends well the CRPG elements of progression, questing, world building, and level design like that of KOTOR and Deus Ex with the real-time combat mechanics of third-person shooters like Gears of War. Like KOTOR, Mass Effect truly works well as a hybrid to define the action RPG genre.\n\nFlaw-wise, the combat is subpar on multiple fronts: enemy AI requiring any novelty to overcome, friendly AI, and equipment. Sidequests are also often not good: the galaxy map outside the main zones are empty areas reusing assets and with little to do besides accumulating collectibles. The dialogue wheel is Mass Effect's worst influence on the genre. The characters also have little depth compared to its RPG titans, with less time to really provide their input.\n\n__Story.__ The overall saga and worldbuilding is great. As an original IP, it's quite astonishing how much depth they're able to place with its races, galaxies, and characters. It's less derivative than the Dragon Age series for example. The main crew is not as memorable as other main Bioware companions like in Dragon Age or KOTOR unfortunately: they're just not enough depth to make them stand out, enough companion missions, and other integrations to the gameplay.\n\n__Gameplay.__ It's an action RPG with third-person shooting, talent trees and dialogue, and with Bioware's signature elements: for example, a morality system, branching dialogue options, companions, and multiple playable classes. Like other Bioware games, Mass Effect 1 features semi-open level designs where areas are large and incentivize exploration but aren't so large that they're empty or make traversal tedious with artificial collectibles---a common symptom of open-world RPGs and a symptom in Mass Effect's non-main planets. These elements all work very well. Minigame-like mechanics of the Mako and hacking also provide variety.\n\n[The third-person shooting is serviceable but not stellar.](https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/5eucr3/comment/dafcmrd) Enemy variety, but enemy AI (friendly AI included) is dumb, making the game not particularly difficult requiring tactics or any build optimization as enemies just run straight to you at best: you can safely hide behind cover. Equipment variety is also severely lacking with little difference within a gun type. Higher difficulties just wind up the imbalance where many enemies barely hurt you, rockets and lasers one-shot you, and you can still immediately CC with biotic/tech abilities.\n\nMass Effect pioneered the dialogue wheel which I dislike over traditional dialogue options. It's too streamlined in its dialogue options, often with fewer options, stock investigate and positive/neutral/negative options; and it doesn't outline the actual dialogue reply. For example, unlike other dialogue-heavy RPGs, there's no negotiation around rewards, and Mass Effect's Charm has much less influence in taking different paths to complete a quest than Bloodlines; doesn't influence your companion's approval of you like Dragon Age; or have faction-like ramifications like Fallout: New Vegas.\n\nSystem-wise, there are levels with XP, talent points, a morality system, companion loyalty (no approval score), and inventory management with equipment and removable upgrades. Abilities rely purely on cooldowns with no mana/stamina bar. I particularly like the healing system where built further in DA Inquisition, it's a consumable. This is as opposed to relying on a specific party member for heals, restricting party composition variety; same goes for grenades as you're not pressured to hoard them. As biotics form magic powers, I like its emphasis on crowd control with your gun still required for damage. Like KOTOR, the rogue-like equivalent of hacking isn't very good unfortunately.\n\nControls are simple and intuitive. Unlike Dragon Age, I like the option of a sprint. With the real-time focus, the use of no pause and instead Q/E to direct your squad members with C to pull back works well. There is no tactics system like Dragon Age to finely control your squad's actions, and the game is considerably less tactical in favor of real-time combat and relying on party AI. The contextual HUD also works well for immersion, keeping a radar-like minimap which solves a pervasive issue in Dragon Age 2 where you focus too much on the minimap.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The graphics are quite gorgeous. You can really see the new detail and lighting with the Legendary Edition. Face animations are stilted and there's still quite a bit of jank such as overlapping voices when skipping dialogue lines. Not unexpected for a 2007 game. With Legendary Edition, certain details have their typical age, and it can be somewhat jarring seeing photorealistic detail on certain scenes and blocky textures in another. The skin-tight outfits especially on all the females, is weird. Soundtrack is suitable for a space opera. John Shephard's voice acting was stilted. Areas are noticeably reused unfortuantely.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ In Legendary Edition, you can mark items as junk and sell all as junk at the vendor.\n+ Companion banter. Something Dragon Age would significantly increase and integrate as part of regular gameplay instead of elevator talk.\n+ Quest markers are only marked if they're in the present area; they don't highlight what area to go next. I like that this provides some quest direction, but not so much like in modern streamlined RPGs that you just follow waypoints and skip reading any quest text. For similar reasons, questgivers aren't explicitly marked on the map. This encourages you to explore the full area instead of just following the minimap and ignoring non-marked up areas.\n+ In Legendary Edition, Mako no longer receives half XP, so you're not pressured to exit Mako everytime for combat.\n+ In Legendary Edition, you can sprint and similarly on the Mako to make traversal just a bit less tedious.\n+ There's enough item variety, and one saving grace of the fact there's enough of the same item with little variety, that you don't need to constantly unequip squad members to have the best gear for your current party. This is a huge quality of life compared to many other RPGs.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ You automatically get loot after an enemy encounter. No need to loot individual corpses. Similarly in the name of action, you don't need to swap to a squad member to hack.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Galaxy map. While it's realistic that you can't land on every planet, the HUD is atrocious. You have to click on every planet to see which is landable rather than simply filtering to know where you can land beforehand. There's also no way to track which ones you've already visited, or which ones still have things to collect.\n+ The various bugs. None were game-breaking but twice I ran into massive FPS drops from 144 to being stuck at 20, [sometimes even 5 FPS](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1328670/discussions/0/5002914669826292436).\n+ The collectible sidequests. Artificially inflates playtime.\n+ Limited graphics options.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Mass Effect Wiki](https://masseffect.fandom.com)\n+ [System Guide](https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_System_Guide), [Assignments](https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Assignments), [Reddit: Important sidequests](https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/3thxm8/bestmost_important_mass_effect_1_unc_side_quests/cx6xw2d)\n+ [Adept Guide](https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Adept_Guide), [Adept Leveling Guide](https://bsn.boards.net/thread/2286/me1-basic-adept-leveling-guide), [Squad Member Builds](https://bsn.boards.net/thread/8321/squadmate-build-compendium-effect-edition)\n+ [Medi-gel and Grenade capacity upgrades](https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment#Medi-gel_and_Grenade_Upgrades)\n\nI played the remaster Legendary Edition on PC which includes all DLC. I played on Veteran difficulty, which is the highest in the base game for a first playthrough. Mass Effect doesn't have a high skill ceiling, so you may as well play what it's designed for. I completed many sidequests (assignments, especially the important ones) and skipped most planets' \"Galaxy-Wide Assignments\" as they're repetitive, defining one of Mass Effect 1's weakest elements. For posterity, systems that I didn't fully explore are clustered top-right: starting from bottom, Hades Gamma, Voyager Cluster, Maroon Sea, Styx Theta, Hawking Eta, Pangaea Expanse, Kepler Verge, Sentry Omega, Armstrong Nebula. I modified a few controls: Crouch to C, 678 as RTY, Tab as Squad.\n\nI played Bastion Adept class. Adept, Soldier, and Infiltrator are the most popular: Soldier is a bit too standard run-and-gun and doesn't use Mass Effect's unique gameplay with biotics or tech, and I'm not currently interested in a one-shot-kill sniper class. Adept is most OP in Mass Effect 1 because biotics bypass shields. I tended to Paragon. Unlike KOTOR's Jedi vs Sith or DA2's rivalry, Renegade is too one-bit as an unlikeable douchebag (particularly in later ME titles). Fortunately there isn't content like quests gated by a morality rating except Charm level, so I didn't feel obligated to always go Paragon; I just roleplayed as a rational Shephard.\n\nBuild-wise, I chose them somewhat ad hoc for Shepard and all squad members. Early game I focused on Charm, Lift, Singularity, Barrier, Pistols; I didn't use a Bonus talent. At the maximum character level of 60 (30 in Legendary Edition), you get 181 total skill points, which is almost enough to max out all 8 skills plus Bonus Power via 21 each so it doesn't matter too much endgame.",

This is coupled with tight platforming and a sufficiently descript story about angst with colorful characters. There is plenty variety in the platforming, art showcasting with its story, and things like the feather mini-game to all enhance the idea of coping and handling depression. Ultimately, the way the story interwaves with gameplay elements, like Madeline achieving the extra jump, is what truly elevates the game.\n\n__Story.__ The highly relatable story with its themes of depression and the whole journey being representative of it. It's particularly impressive how well the game blends these ideas into a platformer, not a genre that's known for its storytelling. The characters are also so charming.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The core gameplay loop is like Super Meat Boy: an arsenal of handcrafted levels that are challenging but fair. And these levels all vary in design with new obstacles, mechanics, and settings. The open world level design particularly makes it unlike typical platformers. Bosses add further variety.\n\nAnother praiseworthy element of Celeste is how it handles difficulty. It works well for casual gamers while still remaining tough due its immediate checkpoints, and it has numerous side areas to collect Strawberries as well as B-worlds to offer further challenge content.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The pixel art ages well as do the character art in all the dialogue scenes, as well as the closing backgrounds for every chapter.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI only played up to Chapter 7. I didn't bother to backtrack for all the Crystal Hearts for Chapter 8, the B/C-side worlds, and the Chapter 9 DLC. That's useful content for a challenge replaythrough.",

    "comments": "Human Revolution is an excellent sequel to Deus Ex (2000). It retains the core gameplay loop well of stealth, exploration, and hacking---all enhanced by its writing, wonderful level design, decent enemy awareness, RPG mechanics for upgrading augmentations enabling different playstyles, and weapon and inventory management.\n\nFlaw-wise, there aren't major ones. Player dialogue doesn't enable much freedom similar to the original title, holding it back from the writing of games like Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines and Fallout New Vegas. There's too much hacking, with less need to explore to find access codes and paths beyond vents to proceed to the next area, and with less variety than the original title's lockpicking, electronics, and computers. The XP system also caters to specific playstyles, limiting other builds which are still viable albeit less encouraged.\n\n__Story.__ The main story works well, albeit stereotypical like the last game. The characters are serviceable but don't stand out. There's a handful of sidequests, and each unique in their gameplay elements and writing to ultimately better build the involved characters as well as the world in Deus Ex. The little player agency in terms of dialogue with the dialogue battles works decently well---nothing like Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines though.\n\n__Gameplay.__ I like the gameplay loop with stealth, hacking, and FPS combat. The cover system works particularly well for stealth, enabling extra camera angles to pass an enemy over a corner. Stealth makes use of line of sight, sound based on your movement controls, takedowns, and body movement. Human Revolution also retains Deus Ex's RPG mechanics such as augmentations, inventory management, and passcodes as you pick up items. Furthermore, the core systems with level design incentivizing multiple approaches, guard awareness, civilian NPCs, and sidequests work excellently.\n\nCompared to Deus Ex (2000), it's the quality-of-life features that make Human Revolution simpler to enjoy in modern times: for example, a melee takedown (including a double takedown), weapons that make nonlethal more viable, passive augmentations, no juggling of lockpicks, multitools, and keyring, health and energy regen, slightly easier difficulty with the radar and cover system to peek around corners, simpler controls, and no wonky underwater swimming with combat. These streamline the gameplay mostly for the better.\n\nI like the different playstyles of stealth with melee takedowns, stealth ranged, navigating hidden passages such as vents, and going full Rambo combat. Unfortunately, every action is gamified in order to add XP for augmentations. I do like that the game favors completing all objectives including side mission ones, hacking, and exploring. However, it overly incentivizes specific playstyles: takedowns over range, non-lethal over lethal, taking down all enemies vs ghost-ing past, and hacking even if you know the passcode. This greatly reduces the actual variety you can do, with a simple fix: just reward the mission objectives, not micro actions! To best enjoy the game, it was difficult turning off the completionist mindset, avoiding savescumming and making do with suboptimal actions. There are also dialogue battles, and some but not much dialogue options to influence quest outocmes.\n\nHacking is a central part of the game, and I find the minigame done pretty well. It achieves the core element of rushing to clearance, with datastores as optional for side rewards. It's also nice that it's done in real time. There's just a little too many areas to hack though; you're hacking at least every 2 minutes of the game! At least add more variety like Deus Ex (2000)'s trifecta of lockpicking, electronics, and computers.\n\nI greatly enjoyed the DLC as a separate set of missions right before the final ones. It's a nice change of pace, particularly in resetting your augmentations as the game felt a little stale with you being so overpowered with all your augmentations and upgraded weapons. All the backtracking in the latter half of the DLC is infuriating though.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Graphics have aged pretty well in their textures and lighting; comparable to Dragon Age 2. The face models are clearly the most aged. The transition between pre-rendered cutscenes and in-game can also be jarring. Voice acting is great.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Gameplay dialogue options like directions and the HUD is natural in this cybernetic world, adding to the immersion. It also slightly makes up for all the interactible objects being outlined in yellow.\n+ Aside from maximizing XP and credits, the only missables are the upgrades of Praxis Kits and weapon mods. There is plenty, and none are central to the game given that you don't really need any augmentations, and most mods aren't even applicable for non-lethal weapons. New Game Plus also lets you pick up anythings you missed on the first playthrough.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ The radar. Combined with the cover system and melee takedown, the radar makes Human Revolution's stealth significantly easier than the original title.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Access codes are automatically tracked as you pick up notes. It's nice for convenience, particularly when there are many notes or access codes. However, it removes any gameplay incentive to read notes. This is a common problem in video games that add such notes to build lore. They're walls of text that interrupt gameplay, not enhance it.\n+ It's not obvious which areas you're safe and which areas you're being hunted. For example, did a civilian catch you hacking a door and alert police?\n+ Boss fights. They're not something that should be designed for a stealth game, and while I like the stealth options in the Director's Cut, it's obvious they weren't designed this way. It's a good thing they're so cheeseable at least with the Typhoon or fully upgraded Revolver.\n+ Tutorials are videos, not interactive within the game. It's an aged design reminding me of Splinter Cell Chaos Theory (2005).\n+ Unlike Deus Ex (2000), you can't hack turrets or robots. This limits your options to stealthing around them or destroying them (often triggering alarms as it's rare to one-shot them).\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Deus Ex Wiki](https://deusex.fandom.com)\n+ [Augmentation priorities](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/lg8ml/im_late_and_just_started_playing_deus_ex_human)\n\nI played the Director's Cut. I played on medium difficulty: difficulty only scales player and enemy health, accuracy, and regen making little difference for stealth. I did a non-lethal stealth/hacking playthrough, killing on emergencies rather than savescumming (I still do to an extent). I favored non-lethal takedowns for maximum XP and ammo followed by tranq rifle headshots and stun gun; 10mm pistol for distractions; and revolver or Typhoon for bosses. Augmentation-wise, I favored new options (e.g., Hacking, Heavy Lifting, Jump Enhancement, Punch Through Walls, Social Enhancer). I deliberately did not do any stealth upgrades as they lessened the challenge, particularly the more game-y ones like x-ray vision and enemy tracking.",

    "comments": "Decent writing: streamlined in the overall consequences of the Inquisition's rule, what the companions have been up to and their influence on the DLC's story itself, and I found the Qunari villain subplot to be rather unnecessary (the core plot with Solas should have been given more spotlight).\n\nStory-wise, there is little to no player agency. Like the rest of Inquisition, choices in the dialogue wheel are hardly choices: options are questions to solicit more information or, occasionally, vague options to express slightly different emotions that evoke no difference except at that line. Compare to, e.g., control of a small empire with different diplomatic choices in Awakening.\n\nThe level design is linear and cinematic---something you would expect of an action-adventure, not a deep RPG with an ensemble cast each with their own input shaping the story of an RPG. It does work well as an action-adventure, and I wish I were more absorbed into the consequences of the story with the Inquisition disbanding if the base game's story was necessarily interesting.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI barely had motivation to complete Inquisition's base game, skipping all side content. I played the Trespasser DLC as I'm only interested in good writing and affecting the core storyline. Played at level 17 and on Normal difficulty.\n\n+ Jaws of Hakkon is a larger Crestwood and I didn't even enjoy Crestwood with its superficial main quest. In fact, I skipped many zones altogether.\n+ The Descent is a dungeon crawl, with no story, just Dwarven lore percolated throughout the dungeon. I'd rather just read a wiki or until I ever get a mood for Inquisition combat (which is rare; I find it the worst among the 3 DA titles).",

    "comments": "DAI is an ambitious title for the series, experimenting with its year's trends: even more real-time action, open-world levels, and commander mission management. While I can admire (and quite enjoy) the third-person real-time combat, the other inclusions do no good for Dragon Age. The game's best content---Inquisitor's Path main quests and Inner Circle companion quests---is diluted with the most generic MMO sidequests, resource grinding, and War Table micromanagement. DAI barely makes use of its grand areas, many zones devoid of main quests entirely.\n\nDAI also takes streamlining too far, removing key elements of Dragon Age's legacy: companion tactics AI, leveling attributes, and sustained abilities. The game plays so close to an action RPG that there's little point for it to even carry the pause and tactical camera features, feeling more like a run-of-the-mill action RPG.\n\n__Story.__ The overarching story of an inquisition to close the Breach is okay. I like the continuation of the various DA1-2 characters appearing in Inquisition. The setting of both Orlais and Ferelden areas is great, enabling unprecedented variety in levels and exposure to less seen cultures: Orlais and the Chantry.\n\nUnfortunately, the characters don't stand out. Companions are not as notable as prior games, with less ability to provide input into the game like in DA2. There's also much less banter as it's rarely activated, and fewer quests per companion. No character, including even ones from the prior titles, have much of a chance to shine.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Inquisition pushes further on the spectrum of real-time action RPGs and farther from tactical CRPGs. Unlike MMOs like WoW that DAO and DA2 leaned to, Inquisition is closer to third-person action RPGs like Dark Souls, Witcher, and Assassin's Creed.\n\nOne of DAI's newest changes is an open world level design. Symptomatic of open world RPGs, DAI is littered with low-quality quests with minimal story, consisting of kill X enemies, fetch X resources, complete X objectives across the map. The areas are wonderfully designed with variety and verticality---certainly solving DA2's biggest flaw---but you navigate by moving from quest marker to quest marker with barebones dialogue for why. They should've less time on level design and more time on quests that make use of those levels. Even many companion quests, which are the highest quality sidequests, are grindy; and most all main quests don't even use the open world but rather instanced zones. Open world-wise, Witcher 3 is the best example that lacked in sidequest gameplay, following formulas like DAI; but they were still greatly enjoyable because the writing substantiated each one.\n\nDAI introduces a War Table to complete missions across the world. It uses mobile-like mission gameplay, where you send advisors and wait a period for them to complete. It includes a currency of Power and Influence points, one to advance the missions completed and another for perks. Not unlike WoW's implementation, I found this made you feel less like a commanding strategist and more like a tedious micromanager, interrupting the core game by visiting the war table to send your advisors off again. I do like that the Quartermaster requisitions table makes use of crafting resources (crafting resources were near useless in DA1-DA2), but gameplay-wise, it is a tedious series of fetch quests (and infinite!) alongside shards and other open world quest objectives.\n\nProgression-wise, stats follow previous titles, and with abilities using the DA2's web system. It's further streamlined in that attributes are automatically assigned on level ups. Sustained abilities are removed entirely, which is a shame as I always felt they were the best implementation to MMO-style buffs. With that said, I do like some additions to the mechanics. For example, focus abilities like Divinity 2 which act as more powerful abilities saved for the occasional combat. Permanent upgrades include fade bonuses, amulets of power, potion upgrades, inventory capacity, creature research. Equipment follows previous titles, newly with more upgrades to weapons and armor adding customizability.\n\nThe companion system follows previous titles, newly with advisors. The tactics system is a significant downgrade in the name of streamlining, [removing the if-then customization with behavior presets]( https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/aaxeak/no_spoilers_the_combat_in_inquisition_makes_me). I can see the appeal of pushing the game towards third-person action RPGs where you only control one character. But it removes one of DA's most important value-adds to the mixed MMO/action RPG genre. Certain classes as AI play worse, doing best as tank and support and worst as DW rogue, reaver warrior, and knight enchanter mage. It also diminishes the importance of a party, which is a key element in DA compared to western RPGs like Elder Scrolls and Witcher. The approval system is also a downgrade from DA2: like DAO, only maximum companion approval is important. There is no rivalry scale. Furthermore, approval only gates companion quests and romance, doing little more like boosting stats or DA2's unique friend/rival abilities.\n\nControls enforce a real-time playstyle. Abilities no longer auto-move to execute an attack but execute immediately; and the default attack does not move you like DA1-2's auto-attack toggle. I like the effect this has: positioning is important with effects like a 2H warrior's swing potentially striking multiple enemies; and different weapons have different reach. Mouse look is also useless as you never click to move or target NPCs; your mouse instead always controls the camera. Ultimately, the controls represent a compromise: as a third-person action RPG, you feel more immersed in playing a character rather than instructing one; but you sacrifice the tactical combat of previous titles with fine-tuned instructions (move to this spot, cast fireball at this location to hit all enemies and not you, etc.).\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Graphics are gorgeous with detail, lighting, and color. For a game in 2014, it looks like later games like Dishonored 2 (2016), Witcher 3 (2015), and Horizon Zero Dawn (2017). There's voice acting like DA2 but with more options as you can select your race. I also love the Tarot card and portrait artstyle.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ The game removes healing spells and puts more emphasis on healing items and defensive utilities like Barrier. I like the idea of removing a heal bot as a crutch as in DA1-DA2: I resent Wynne and Anders as characters as they're so one-dimensional in DA1/2 respectively.\n+ Minimap. DA2's minimap was too good, leaving you to constantly look at the minimap to navigate areas whereas DAO had none, requiring you to constantly press M find the quest marker or zone you're missing. DAI's minimap is more like a compass which enables immersion.\n+ Dragon Age Keep enable custom world states to give you different playthrough backgrounds.\n+ Quality-of-life controls: Tab to cycle target enemies, command your party to attack enemy you're targeting or disengage, jump, auto-run.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ No health regeneration outside of combat.\n+ To increase immersion, you can't see the companion's approval.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Fuck the Hinterlands. Literally no main quests and no side quests are interesting: it's one-line questgivers with a gameplay loop of wandering an empty zone killing enemies and picking up items. Hinterlands is representative of the worst parts of DAI: sidequest quality lacking any story, player agency, or gameplay variety; and large areas made artificially busy by finding X items, marking landmarks, and other menial tasks.\n+ [\"Valuables\"](https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Valuables) replaces DA1-2's junk and unfortunately, they're not always junk. Some are used for creature research (highlighted yellow), requisitions, and companion gifts. So you have to selectively hoard them by monitoring which items are requisition in the Wiki, yellow, or gifts.\n+ Auto-leveling attributes as a streamlined element. There wasn't much build customization in the first place in previous titles (e.g., all Rogues focus on DEX/CUN), but I do think it's helpful to be able to control when to pump CON or WIL vs your damage stat.\n+ I despise the Search button. It's a mini-Detective Mode, highlighting interactible assets by spamming a key rather than making them more visible through the game's native design. I much prefer the \"highlight all\" from prior games as it's more like action RPGs.\n+ Multiplayer mode, although I never experienced it. I like the idea of coop, but as it's detached from the main game, the multiplayer has little content and is very grindy.\n+ The horse is a lazy implementation to adjust for areas being so empty. Because it also removes party members, it's a weird compromise as a game meant for a party and not a solo player RPG.\n+ No altitude indicator on minimap icons. This is especially important since the game's levels feature so much verticality with mountains and mines. This, combined with arbitrary gates in certain areas that force you to go back to the War Table to unlock the gate, can be infuriating to even know if you can reach a certain quest.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Valuables](https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Valuables).

[War Table - No Waiting](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonageinquisition/mods/479) removes one of the game's worst elements. [More Banter mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonageinquisition/mods/1454) makes banter more active although still not enough. [Quicker Looting](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonageinquisition/mods/788) removes the loot animation reminiscent of Witcher 3's looting.\n\n __On mouse and keyboard vs controller.__ Both are a compromise. With controller, movement and camera control is more intuitive, as well as actions like Interact and combat abilities. With mouse and keyboard, you can quick save/load, control zoom, and more keybindings means instant access to 4 other abilities, quick heal and potions, party commands, and menus. Ultimately, I chose controller as I think the intuitive controls and analog sticks outweigh the extra keybindings.\n\n__On difficulty & trials.__ I switched between Hard and Normal difficulty without friendly fire, toning things down when things got too frustrating because difficulty just scales enemy damage/sponginess and adds more time to the grinding. I played with one trial: Even Ground. Even Ground scales enemies to be at least the same XP level as you, keeping areas that you overlevelled to still be interesting. Some also use Take it Slow (after getting to Skyhold to avoid playing with minimal abilities and because you won't get max level until during Trespasser and completing all sidequests if you started with it). Take It Slow halves XP as you'll easily reach max level midway through the game with Even Ground and completing all sidequests. I skipped most side quests (even some zones) as it's Inquisition's weakest point.\n\n__On playthrough choices.__ I sided with Templars. I wanted to switch things up from DA2, and it seems not unreasonable in DAI given the Inquisition's Chantry background and advisors. Unfortunately, DA is always one-sided in depicting mages as the oppressed underdog and going out of the way to show Templars as arrogant and abusing their power (see DAI's Val Royeaux).\n\n+ __Inquisitor.__ Male Qunari 2H DPS warrior. My playstyle is to draw threat while doing lots of AOE on the frontline. I chose warrior to change things up from a Mage in DAO and Rogue in DA2.\n+  I swapped party members semi-regularly to experience different specializations and companions, not aiming to minmax. Typical party comp was a tank, mage, and rogue.",

    "comments": "VTMB is the symbol of a flawed masterpiece. It does so many elements that stand the test of time: player agency and replayability with diverse playstyles; writing around the story, worldbuilding, and characters with excellent main and sidequests; and deep RPG mechanics such as clans, vampire disciplines, and ground rules. The flaws cannot be ignored though: jank with bugs, model pop-ins, camera positioning, and animations; combat-only areas at its final third and Chinatown and Hollywood being much more empty than earlier hubs; and the mediocre combat with a weird imbalance of guns being very weak early game and overpowered endgame.\n\n__Story.__ VTMB stands out in its writing, uniquely positioning itself not only in video games but fiction more broadly in its urban-vampire world, one crafted with precision. Here, it's not the vampirism itself that takes focus but the social contracts with responsibilities and relationships around vampires. Worldbuilding with the laws of the masquerade, the urban cities, and the clans work excellently. The characters are also stellar, with even side characters having their own charming personality.\n\nThe subtlety in the storytelling is also what adds much of VTMB's charm. For example, never directly talking about the split personality of Jeanette-Therese until after the reveal; the medical resident selling blood at the hospital; the security guard stalking his apartment residents in Skyline Apartments; the e-mails explaining why the guy is even there at an Abandoned Hospital to have encountered a vampire.\n\n__Gameplay.__ VTMB is an RPG with unique gameplay elements for its vampire setting. There's typical mechanics like stats affecting combat, environment navigation, and social; and dialogue with choices around allegiances for player agency. There's a range of interesting mechanics around vampirism. For example, there's health regeneration because you're a vampire, increased regen when you feed, and decreased regen when when you sustain aggravated damage like fire and supernatural attacks. Quality of blood also matters, and blood must be filled by feeding which is the resource for vampire powers. A stealth meter is much appreciated as opposed to Elder Scrolls' more opaque approach.\n\nDialogue also takes front seat with multiple approaches to navigate a conversation not unlike the multiple approaches to break into a place. A quest might involve finding a passcode by hacking, persuasion, or just going in and killing everything.\n\nThe stats feature quite the depth following the tabletop game with Attributes, Abilities, each in combinations contributing to Feats that improve combat, covert operations, and social abilities, and with Disciplines for vampire powers. Humanity and masquerade violations are important to track. Instead of levels, you directly spend experience points as a second currency to cash for material items. Balance is decent across the stats, enabling diverse playthroughs with different opportunities: for example, Malkavian's ravings being its own fun; Nosferatu's forcing stealth in sewers to hide from humans at all opportunities; Tremere's blood magic; male or female; and choices to effectively go with combat, stealth, or social..\n\nControls and HUD are intuitive with WASD movement, E interact, shooting/melee and vampire powers as mouse buttons, and other actions like reloading, feeding, and inventory/quest management. You can fast swap to specific weapons by setting up your hotkeys (K). You can toggle between first and third-person view. The health and blood bar work great.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Face models and overall details see their age. The soundtrack is pretty decent. Voice acting is superb. The atmosphere, particularly in certain areas like the Ocean House Hotel is phenomenal. Built on the Source Engine, the physics simulator in the game is arguably unnecessary, adding to a bit of the jank such as you getting stuck behind doors as they open/close too slowly.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ No explicit quest objectives.\n+ You gain no XP for fighting enemies, only by completing mission objectives. It's a great way to balance combat and pacifist playstyles.\n+ The feed mechanic as a way to restore blood. It really makes you start treating all the humans as walking blood bags, resources for you to consume at your will.\n+ Elysium ground means you can still attack important NPCs.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ The closed but dense level design of its areas, similar to Deus Ex. This is in direct contrast to open world games like Elder Scrolls and Fallout. The closed design enables more curation of the content but a lot of tedious backtracking, requiring you to remember closed off zones due to high lockpicking for example.\n+ No map. I like the full immersion in needing to know where you go. However, it can be fairly irritating to memorize all the locations: the wiki's pointer for where each named place is sufficient.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n+ The little things that make the game dense for a beginner: letting folks play Malkavian or Nosferatu without warning, planning the character sheet, skill books and trainers have point ranges for them to remain useful, knowing to use a cab to travel between areas.\n+ The weapon stats are arbitrarily opaque: the idea of weapon types performing differently based on your skill is great, but the stats themselves are unintuitive. Damage potential is all that matters, calculated as a function of the rest.\n+ Aiming with the gun is terrible. The crosshair aim decreasing accuracy as you move is clearly borrowed from Half-Life/Counter-Strike's Source Engine. It doesn't work in a game where the enemies and you are highly mobile. Add to that that early game guns have useless damage and guns cost money per bullet compared to melee.\n+ No option to limit the number of quick saves. Quick saves always make a new save.\n+ Bloodbuff is unbalanced. With 5 to all physical stats, you can bypass a large portion of lockpicking areas without investing a single point. The idea of using your blood to temporarily increase your capability to do so is good, but 5 is too much.\n+ Fuck the Warrens sewers. A navigating maze of unintuitive level progression combined with annoying enemies and only rats for feeding.\n+ Your haven is unnecessarily far away with many loading screens (Downtown -> Skyline Aparmtents -> Elevator up and down). There should be an easier way to access e-mail quests and your lockbox.\n+ You have to walk into every building to know if the doors are even interactable. Makes it easy to miss a location.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Gun guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/vtmb/comments/ee9rv1/vtmb_firearms_guide_basic_patch_version)\n\nI was originally motivated to play VTMB by hearing about its modern sequel, and because it's one of the most underrated yet highly praised games---a flawed excellent work like [Dragon's Dogma](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/02/dragons-dogma-the-most-influential-game-no-one-ever-copied) and on par with titans like Dragon Age: Origins, Fable, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, and Witcher 3.\n\nFollowing the community, I played with the Unofficial Patch (Basic version, v10.9) which makes minimal changes to fix bugs and support modern settings (2560x1440p, 92 FPS cap, and borderless with -window option and Borderless Gaming). The Plus version, as well as Malkavian and Nosferatu clans, are particularly good for second playthroughs. I played blind, only looking up for my build, skill books, occult items, teachers, and when I get stuck; I didn't care too much if I missed sidequests as future playthroughs can get them.\n\nFor my first playthrough I wanted to focus on speech as the writing is VTMB's strength. My character sheet is clan Toreador, male, and focusing on: 8 Persuasion (Charisma / Scholarship), 6 Seduction (Appearance / Subterfuge), 6 Research (Intelligence / Scholarship), 7 Lockpicking (Dexterity / Security), 10 Ranged (Perception / Firearms), 10 Defense (Wits / Dodge), 7 Hacking (Wits / Computer by virtue of upping Wits and 2 Computer skill books). Discipline-wise, 3 Celerity, 5 Auspex. By the end of the game, I got tired of the combat-intensive areas so I just turned on `debug_infinite_ammo 2` and occasionally `noclip`.",

Treated as part of the base game, it's a great way to increase the amount of content, which DA2 lacks. It still reuses areas however, adding to the feeling of repetitiveness.\n+ Legacy. Took Anders (has most unique content), Varric, and Fenris. Battle-intensive as you explore dungeons. Story and player agency is lacking as is any new enemies.\n+ Mark of the Assassin. Took Isabela and Aveline (has most unique content, including 2 quests). New setting of Orlais which adds worldbuilding (especially green after all the drabness of the repeated areas!), companion, a few enemies, and a soundtrack. There's even a stealth minigame.\n\n    All the marketing (including live-action series) and voice acting by Felicia Day is off-putting. I'm not a fan of her \"brand\" of geekdom---a weird combination of quirky sex comedy---and it breaks immersion.\n\nI played The Exiled Prince in Act 1 as it's initiated automatically. I played Legacy and Mark of the Assassin in Act 3---later in the game to experience the vanilla base campaign as much as possible, and to pad out Act 3 which is the shortest of them all. It also gives some content left for me to experience after optimizing endgame builds and gear.",

    "comments": "Dragon Age 2 is a flawed improvement to DAO. I greatly enjoyed its real-time battles, feeling more streamlined and movement-oriented with stylish animations; it's a change of pace from DAO's slower and methodical combat. Companions are also given greater depth, reinforced with new mechanics to provide them more input in your journey including input during dialogue, more companion quests, and more spontaneous conversations.\n\nFlaw-wise, areas are so often reused that the game feels redundant, exacerbated with the disconnected world design. By Act 2, you've seen every level multiple times. Enemy waves are also a lazy design choice to make fights artificially more hectic and difficult. It not only ruins proper positioning for the sake of it but makes encounters feel artificially video game-y where you can't even get a sense of the difficulty of an encounter you'll commit to until you beat it.\n\n__Story.__ Story is less universal than DAO's save the world trope, focusing instead on a single person's journey after the Fifth Blight over 15 years. I greatly enjoy the idea of a focused area and the development of Hawke and his friends over a lengthy period of time. It puts more emphasis on the characters than the grand scale of typical fantasy stories. Hawke is much more pronounced as a personality than DAO's Grey Warden, and the companions all shine in their dialogue and larger role in everyday activities. I also love the consequences with how the companions can leave you (sometimes even betray you).\n\n__Gameplay.__ DA2 continues the action/MMO + RTWP hybrid of DAO and past games like KOTOR. It makes quite a few overhauls---some for the better, some for the worse.\n\nDA2's combat focuses more on real-time than tactics: for example, there is no delay shuffling to a new animation when selecting an ability as in Origins, positioning is less important due to movement abilities (e.g., warrior and rogues automatically close space with autoattack, rogue's Backstab teleports you to their back), potions are quick slots, and enemy waves from any direction mean it's difficult to strategize positioning. Other elements reign: adapting to enemy reinforcements, particularly in target prioritization, threat management (especially if Hawke isn't a warrior), and CCs. I greatly enjoyed the real-time combat and flashier animations, but the enemy waves are clearly one of DA2's worst elements.\n\nMechanics-wise, DA2 streamlines DAO. Combat by default shows no damage numbers and relies on visual indicators of status effects. There are no origin stories or race selection. There are fewer spells and talents. There are no non-combat skills. Almost every area has fast travel. Quest indicators are more prominent, including area indicators for quest objectives instead of referencing your journal to track down a quest. I enjoyed these streamlined elements for the most part. It's more a sense of taste, bringing DA closer to action RPGs with a tighter toolbox than CRPGs.\n\nTraditional heal and tank roles are nerfed in DA2. Anders is the only companion with a group heal, heal cooldowns are lengthy, and Aveline has no threat generation abilities. Instead, DA2 emphasizes more DPS and CC party compositions, with companions freely using health and mana/stamina potions. I quite enjoyed this meta. However, while full DPS in a party is exhilarating, it can be extremely risky at higher difficulties where Anders is almost essential.\n\nMirroring Mass Effect, DA2 introduces a dialogue wheel which I despise: not having the explicit dialogue isn't a dealbreaker, but dialogue wheels make replies reductive by shoehorning them into three personalities. The idea of indirectness by appealing to personalities rather explicit dialogue options is interesting, but it should keep track of your personality similar to companion approval, and/or be even more vague so that future playthroughs can have different personalities all be viable from a role-playing perspective.\n\nCompanions are easily DA2's unrefutable strength, not only in their story but their mechanics. DA2 gives the impression that you're playing more of a solo game, with Hawke living his own life, making choices, and with any picked-up armor to be used only for himself. Anders isn't waiting outside Hawk's house like DAO's party camp, waiting to be chosen to go adventuring. Instead, companions live their lives and you simply have a few tag along. In particular, each has a unique specialization and armor. The approval system is now friendship and rivalry on opposite spectrums. I like the principle of no longer about always pandering for +100 approval, and with rivalries actually inducing companions to change mindsets. Companions also have more explicit dialogue as you wade through dialogue choices, and there is significantly more companion quests.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Graphics are a minor improvement to DAO, with most noticeable in textures and lighting; face models still see their age. Due to rushed development, DA2 reuses many areas and it shows. Main character is voice acted. Dialogue more often has a more dynamic camera than talking heads.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ You can use a keyboard shortcut to target enemies, open chests, and loot corpses. This is something I greatly missed in DAO and which forced unnecessary pausing.\n+ There's finally a tactic for when enemies are clustered. This enables automating AOE. DAO required you to micromanage companions for this. Further, 20 slots for everyone makes their AI significantly smarter.\n+ Spells and talents are acquired under a web and no longer linear. This mitigates a bit of DAO's issue in commiting to waste many skills just to get a certain high-tier one.\n+ Junk is now an isolated category and with an easy \"sell all junk\" option.\n+ Unlike DAO, the minimap HUD is finally of proper size on high resolutions to be useful.\n+ Attack misses aren't as prevalent. There's less RNG than DAO here, and especially less RNG than the dice roll D&D systems in KOTOR and Baldur's Gate.\n+ Only one injury type. The RNG of getting injury types didn't make much sense to me. I like the health cap here; reminds me of Dark Souls 2.\n+ In merchant trade menus, you can select the party member to compare equipment to. Beats exiting the window to go to their inventory to manually check.\n+ The fewer potions and injury kits you have, the more likely they are to spawn. This encourages freely using them, including in everyone's tactics.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Crafting. Crafting was already barebones in DAO and this game streamlined even the materials and never made it core to the gameplay loop. I never touched it until endgame. Things like runes being unremovable just encourages hoarding them. Only later did I realize that the resource varieties you acquire are actually just requirements to craft items; they aren't used up. So runes, potions, and poisons are infinite and fairly cheap.\n+ Missable permanent items: backpacks and tomes if you don't purchase them in the corresponding Act. I like permanent missable companions because they have story consequences. Missing out on upgrades however is plain dumb.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n+ [DW Assassin - One-Shot Overkill (Nightmare Guide)](https://fextralife.com/forums/t300245/dw-assassin--oneshot-overkill-nightmare-guide-updated-for-102103-check-bottom-of-op-july-24th)\n+ [Solo Shadow DW Build (Nightmare) (Updated)](https://fextralife.com/forums/t274966/solo-shadow-dw-build-nightmare-updated)\n+ [DW Rogue endgame equipment](https://fextralife.com/forums/t304315/best-daggers)\n\nI played on Hard difficulty. Nightmare requires more build optimization (not ideal for a blind playthrough), restricts party compositions, and tactical decision-making (pausing). The biggest change is friendly fire which makes pausing to position and aim that much more important---even your party members' AoE requires manual aim as it's no longer viable in Tactics. I played blind. After playing through a quest, I often looked it up to see different scenarios, including 100% rivalries, Carver, companions leaving you, and siding with templars. I completed all sidequests and got everyone to 100% friendship.\n\nI didn't touch any DLC item packs as they're too strong, beating any equipment in the main game which removes a core part of the gameplay loop and its difficulty. There's also so many.. 6 Item Packs, Black Emporium item chest and item shop, Signature Edition Rewards, and a handful of promotional items.\n\nIn selecting a class, I wanted a change of pace from my DAO mage playthrough, and which involves much pausing to position and aim spells. 2H Warrior is viable as a frontliner, particularly due to highest DPS and threat as a manually controlled party member. However, I prefer more innovative Warrior mechanics from games like Dark Souls, Dragonâs Dogma, and Kingdom Come Deliverance (I find CRPG/MMO/ARPG ability cooldown-based warriors are less interesting). In contrast, only CRPGs, MMOs, and ARPGs do DPS rogues justice (the closest action version of Assassin's Creed/Thief/Horizon Zero Dawn aren't actually rogues).\n\n\nParty-wise, I frequently swapped companions unlike in DAO. I enjoyed everyone's dialogue, particularly the spontaneous conversations from companion combos and their input in the dialogue wheel. In addition, everyone's unique specialization and weapon type made it fun to experiment with diverse party compositions (e.g., pure physical, 3 mages, tank, all DPS). Unique companion armor also makes it less tedious than DAO to manage good equipment for your party: simply give each companion the best weapon of their type, and keep 2 sets of magical accessories, 3 sets of physical.\n\n+ __Hawke.__ DW DPS rogue.

    "comments": "Dragon Age: Origins is an interesting mix of ideas from an array of RPGs: D&D systems like Baldur's gate, the more action-oriented and third-person approach of KOTOR, and control and combat ideas from MMOs like World of Warcraft. It reigns as one of the best RTWP games of all time, enabling a style that would not work if it were purely turn-based or real-time. As a new IP with its own lore, DAO also performs surprisingly well across story and characters, and visuals and soundtrack.\n\n__Story.__ DAO's greatest strength writing-wise is its characters. Each companion has a unique personality, with a back-and-forth dynamic and sufficient character development. A lot of the companion's quips are funny as are the companion dialogues among themselves---found myself laughing quite a bit throughout the game. Origin stories also provide unique lore for your playable character. This adds a bit more personalization and increases replayability.\n\nThe overall narrative and locations are fairly superficial in their fantasy tropes, not going too far with them. However, I love all the two-sided choices that the game forces you to make, even if they have no important consequences (the illusion of choice). With that said, there's often little to go off of in order to make any particular choice well-substantiated. It's like a game of two parties each saying one line that the other party is at fault, and now you have to decide.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The game inherits many mechanics from Baldur's Gate (and subsequently, D&D, KOTOR, and the like). DAO introduces several new aspects.\n\nCombat is effectively KOTOR's but more tactical following Baldur's Gate.\n\n+ Abilities are cooldown-based like World of Warcraft. This greatly improves KOTOR's spamming of the single best ability, forcing diversity in gameplay. I also greatly prefer this approach to magic over the approach in Baldur's Gate (D&D 2nd edition), which limits spell usage within a day. The cooldown system combined with tactical level design makes RTWP natural for DAO---something that can't be said for KOTOR. You can do real-time combat for quite a few fights, particularly if you're just steamrolling mobs. And you can apply more tactics and pause when the fights become challenging. It's an excellent hybrid between, say, World of Warcraft and Divinity.\n\n+ Sustained abilities avoid the tedium of micromanaging buffs. In fact, if the game weren't tactical involving a party, you could almost play the game like an MMO without pausing (indeed, that's what DAO's console ports cater to).\n+ Spell combo system, effectively a predecessor to Divinity's environmental effects. These encourage synergy among party members. My favorites are Shattering and Paralysis Explosion.\n+ Threat, including threat management abilities like taunt.\n+ Injury mechanic, where party members resurrect freely after combat but incur a penalty.\n\nControls are intuitive. DAO borrows from MMOs with its action bar for multiple ability keybinds and movement---a feature I wished KOTOR had. The camera control enables both third-person and isometric and I enjoy the option: third-person for general movement; isometric for tactical combat. You can Tab highlight interactive objects: it's a great improvement from KOTOR and one I enjoyed in Divinity.\n\nCompanion-wise, the most significant addition is a tactics system to control party AI. Tactics provide if-then conditions to greatly customize AI in ways you couldn't in Baldur's Gate and KOTOR---effectively FF12's Gambit system but where the tactics don't apply to the character you're controlling so you can't automate fights. It works to great effect, although it's not great for AoE or CC's, both of which you must do manually. Companions also have a approval relationship that you build, including romance options, similar to Mass Effect. \n\nProgression-wise, DAO has standard D&D choices: classes, companions, attributes, skills, talents and spells. Fade bonuses provide permanent stat attributes (reminding me of Fallout's bobbleheads). Purchasable backpacks increase inventory capacity. I like the Fatigue effect to balance armor usage. Quest and side quest progression is standard.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ It's difficult to evaluate 2009 graphics in 2021. The detail on face models, assets, and lighting all age decently well. DAO certainly escaped the curse of PS1 era games and open empty levels. Voice acting and soundtrack is also great, although like previous Bioware games, the main character has no voice actor. Lines coming from various dialogue choices can lead to inconsistent voice acting at times, either being too high/low in emotions from one line to the next or losing a certain gruffness/personality.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ You can configure plot helpers (quest objective markers). I like the default of only showing for explored areas. Like other Bioware games, there aren't explicit objectives.\n+ You can skip the intro movies (startup screen).\n+ Sell price is consistently 25%. Means you don't have to travel to a specific merchant every time to clean your inventory.\n+ Enemy and item loot does not despawn.\n+ Like DAO Awakening, clicking on a party member no longer initiates a conversation with them. No accidental clicks like in DAO!\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Like other RTWP games and unlike KOTOR, you can't queue actions. There is also no auto or keyboard-based targeting like WoW: you have to manually click on targets.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ No overworld but rather instanced areas connected to others by a world map.\n+ Font size and UI is too small for modern resolutions. The [FtG UI mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/73) helps but doesn't work on everything (particularly the minimap and tooltip).\n+ Multi-town/item collection quests don't update with which ones you already completed. You have to commit progress to memory, which makes them especially tedious if you missed one and don't know which.\n+ No jumping physics. This means there are invisible boundaries when climbing up or down terrain, making the game feel more narrow.\n+ Online capabilities. There are many outdated guides in 2021. Installing the game fresh, all DLCs already came with the game. I was also able to log into the in-game servers (your password can't have [special characters](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Dragon_Age:_Origins#EA_Account_Log-In_Issues)), which is helpful for tracking achievements in-game. However, because the Bioware website is forever down, your online profile and any uploading is meaningless. It also doesn't connect achievements to your Origin account, where originally (~2015) Steam used to give you the CD Key so you can also add the game to Origin. Oh well, achievements are unnecessary, especially if they're not Steam's.\n+ Quite a few sidequests are tedious point A-B-C-D fetch quests, and further with no way to track partial progress.\n+ No borderless natively. Borderless Gaming works well though, and it's fortunate that the original game supports 2560x1440p.\n+ System issues: Random game crashes due to a known memory leak, particularly in areas/battles with lots of assets (fixed with a [4GB RAM patch](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233222451). Console commands also aren't visible (fixed with a mod).\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Dragon Age Wiki](https://dragonage.fandom.com)\n+ [Mage attributes and spells](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769732428)\n+ [Mage skills](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/920668-dragon-age-origins/58084638)\n\nThis entry does not include any DLCs. I was originally motivated to play this as it's one of the best western RPGs apparently and the best entry into the Dragon Age series. I played on normal difficulty.

As a third-person shooter, it innovates on responsive movement controls such as the cover mechanic that first-person shooters can't compete with; and an active reload mechanic that keeps staying in cover more dynamic. The campaign also plays well with enemy AI, with level designs encouraging strategic play with positioning. Like Halo and other console shooters, Gears of War is also great at different levels of play: solo, local coop, and coop with strangers.\n\nFlaw-wise, the game plays overall like a streamlined console shooter, never going much beyond its linear levels, fast-paced shooting, and serviceable story. It's fun to enjoy its mechanics and drop-in to play chapters online, but doesn't go much beyond that (c.f., Left 4 Dead 2). The weapon and enemy variety also isn't there nor is the friendly AI's pathing, where your coop companion often gets stuck or just runs into crossfire.\n\n__Story.__ Serviceable to give the linear level playthrough reason.

I do like the 4-person squad camradarie.\n\n__Gameplay.__ As a third-person shooter, Gears of War uniquely identifies the genre with its most inventive mechanic of cover, complemented by its dynamic and responsive movement controls (e.g., active reload, FOV-restricted sprint, weapons like the Hammer of Dawn). Other games have tried to emulate it, but do it poorly without the level design complementing strategic gameplay with ample cover areas, destructible cover, enemy AI that similarly take cover and/or try to flank you, and sprinting and dodging actions to rush to a new cover. As an action game, levels are linear, mission objectives are clearly marked, and there is plenty ammo. Enemy variety is decent. My main complaint is that heavy enemies are simple one-shots (revenators and rocket guys), without the forced change of player tactics like in Doom games.\n\nThe health system is regenerative which I'm less enthusiastic about. Weapon swapping is only twofold alongside grenades, which like Halo is due to console limitations; weapon variety is also lacking. I used the Lancer Rifle all game as all others were too situational and the two weapon slots didn't make sense to keep one for that purpose.\n\nControls are intuitive and responsive. Beyond the standard ones for shooting and movement, there's a single button for run (which restricts movement angles), cover, and dodge. An interact button for context-sensitive actions. The active reload mechanic is excellent. I like the \"aim toward objective\" to observe scripted content. HUD is also minimal to maximize immersion.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Graphics are incredibly detailed and age well. The destroyed terrain is pretty. I prefer the original's darker lighting and slightly more grungy details. The Ultimate Edition is a little too colorful and with more cartoony character models.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ The path choices. Especially with the coop system and Insane difficulty, this makes for ample replayability.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ You can change the launch settings to enable 60 FPS cutscenes. But it's buggy, once in a while making you unable to move in the game. I found this inconsistency in effectively having to relaunch the game was too big to ignore for 30 extra FPS.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ On keyboard and mouse, you can't separately change your look vs aim sensitivity, the default has aim lower than look, and the overall sensitivity has a slider that's hard to be precise. You can only change these separately on controller.\n+ All the ammo crates for refilling is too video game-y, looking out of place.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI played the Ultimate Edition (2015) remake on PC. It has better controls and supports modern resolutions, although sacrifices the gritty visuals of the original. I played on Hardcore difficulty. I played on keyboard and mouse, and to get my preferred aim sensitivity, I had to use in-game of near lowest on slider at 800 DPI.\n\nUltimately, both input methods of keyboard and mouse vs controller are compromises in third-person shooters. Controllers have more flexible diagonal movement and button placement. All the non-aim actions are just more intuitive with a controller as most third-person shooters (Gears included) was designed for console. However, mouses have more precise aim and camera control. I often can't settle on one universal choice for third-person shooters (c.f., my entries on Dead Space and Resident Evil games).",

    "comments": "KOTOR is an excellent mix of CRPGs in its mechanics and quests, and MMOs in its controls and UI toward gameplay that leans more toward \"real-time\" than \"tactical\" in the RTWP system. Further, by doing this all in the Star Wars universe with decent story and characters, it's not surprising to see why KOTOR is such a fan favorite. Flaw-wise, I was not impressed by the fairly superficial story, not going deeper than it could be in its character development; and I found the RTWP combat system bothersome, not aging as well as a core MMO system embracing full real-time combat with keybindable actions would.\n\n__Story.__ The world-building is perhaps the most satisfying, alongside all the details in various quests that goes into building out the main story's progression. Characters all have intriguing personalities although they serve standard archetypes for the Star Wars franchise. HK-47 is really the only memorable character. Each planet is fairly barebones in fairly linear levels with the typical main and sidequests though, not really standing out in quest stories like Bethesda games.\n\n__Gameplay.__ KOTOR extends the Baldur's Gate combat system of D&D and real-time with pause combat with the star wars universe and MMO controls. These MMO controls and UI remain intuitive, aging well. There are even many keyboard shortcuts for most its action keys, even switching a given slot's feat/power/item and the generic interact key. I like KOTOR's mix of CRPG and MMO as it's single player third-person, and you can Tab-toggle to swap to different party members while letting the rest be controlled by AI. I find the RTWP unnecessary in the game however as KOTOR plays to its strength where you can focus on real-time for most all the combat, with less need for party micromanagement for maximal tactics. In fact, KOTOR would be better with World of Warcraft's combat, where all action choices are in real time, and you can further move while attacking to give the game a further sense of dynamism. RTWP is too weird a compromise between real-time combat (favoring dynamic reactions) and turn-based combat (favoring strategy and positioning).\n\nProgression-wise, I'm a fan of the single class -> advanced class choice combination. 3 classes of each is simple enough to enable different archetypes while still enabling replayability with different pathways. The stats of attributes, skill points (non-combat based), and feats (combat-based) work well alongside weapon upgrades for customizability. I'm also a fan of the alignment system, with the light vs dark working particularly well for the Star Wars universe, and is a mechanic I thoroughly enjoyed in Jade Empire.\n\nCompanions add to the complexity of battle, and with their own customizable progression with attributes, skills, and feats. It's not as deep as Bethesda games however, as you don't really maintain a companion relationship that has a lasting influence on dialogue choices. In Fallout: New Vegas, for example, one companion causes a whole faction to automatically attack you. There are companion quests, but they don't go very far. Gameplay-wise, the AI is extremely stupid and barely uses any feats, with limited preset scripts.\n\nI love KOTOR's force powers. They're all so powerful, and you even regenerate force points quickly as soon as you're out of battle. Force Jump is like a flashier and cooldown-less Charge from World of Warcraft. Flash Lightning not only does massive ranged DPS but is AOE. Crowd control powers like Fear not only incapacitate a target but also are cooldown-less and even let you hit them while incapacitated. If only the party AI had more scripting functions!\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Overall detail shows its age as a 3D game, but the soundtrack and voice acting for all lines remain great. Most obvious in its age are the very linear levels, with flat traversal in terrain and largely empty areas with sparse assets and NPCs.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ The meta of delaying levels so you can accumulate them under your secondary class. It's great that you still gain XP while not saving levels. Adds a bit of extra challenge if you want to min max that way.\n+ Quests and levels are linear enough that it's easy to see how to complete the various missions. You never felt lost without an explicit waypoint.\n+ No enemy respawn (in most areas).\n+ The various minigames to give gameplay a change of pace: in particular, Pazaak and swoop racing.\n+ There's more than enough XP to reach max level. No need to worry about micromanaging XP gain like in Divinity.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ You can quick travel to your hideout in most areas in order to swap party members or upgrade items. It even heals you, so with the quick reload times on PC, it's easy to go back and forth in order to heal.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ The game barely functions in 2021, without proper Windows 10, widescreen, or borderless.\n+ While most of the MMO-style controls have keyboard shortcuts to quickly navigate, several aspects (particularly menus like looting) still require mouse clicks.\n+ You can't see the specific buffs you have on in-game, only Up symbols. This means if you have 2+ buffs, you can't tell which one to reapply.\n+ There was never an incentive for me to buy items with my credits, or even start selling items given the infinite inventory space until endgame. Equipment is too easy to get from drops and quests.\n+ CON and Toughness retroactively increase your VP depending on previous level ups, but INT doesn't for skill points. Be consistent!\n+ No indicator that once you enter the Star Forge system, you're prevented from ever going back to the other worlds.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Playing KotOR in 2021](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1283127504) | [2560x1440p HUD correction files](https://www.reddit.com/r/kotor/comments/3yqt0h/knights_of_the_old_republic_2560x1440_hud_files).

I tried played blind, only using a walkthrough for builds and when I got stuck. But I kept falling into the trap of resorting to a wiki to see all dialogue options to confirm alignment, optimal pathing for rewards, and for any missed quests. As always, in retrospect the game would probably be more enjoyable if I left much of that enshrouded in mystery, and where I have to spend more time analyzing the dialogue text to make choices rather than rely on meta.\n\nBuild-wise, I went 2/18 Scout/Guardian, female, and dark side. I played on Easy difficulty while on Taris as level 2 and then swapped to Normal. By the time I advanced to Jedi, I immediately leveled up to 10. My early party was Carth / Mission, and I eventually settled with Mission / Jolee. I served melee DPS, tank, and force buffs, Mission served ranged DPS and non-combat skills and Jolee served force ranged DPS, crowd control, and heals. Endgame I was so OP I just went by myself, and only with Bastila for the convenience heals.",

Makes the game somewhat fun as a more action-oriented variant of Resident Evil 7. This makes sense since the game wouldn't be as scary now that you know the enemy mechanics. There's plenty new here: Regenerators, Little Crawlers, turrets, and suicide bombers; Chris' HUD and unlocks; anti-regen ammo and grenades.\n\nIt's annoying that the melee attack is the same button as the shoot attack. You can mess up if you incorrectly gauge your distance.\n\nEnd of Zoe: Punching zombies? That's badass. I like the left/right mechanic as well as stealth kills. The more campy elements really shine here while still staying true to the Resident Evil 7 story.\n\nNice detail with the critters as the health item.

    "comments": "RE7 is a unique mix of the first-person horror and survival horror genres. It's an excellent return to form after the action focus of RE4-6, and with its own interpretation as a modern survival horror. Gone are the campy elements and in favor of serious, brutal scenes. Its main flaw is pacing, where the game changes somewhat abruptly from horror to survival horror to F.E.A.R.-style horror, and I wish it stayed on the family the whole game. Still, RE7 is a great experience from start to end. Towards the end of the game, I actually enjoyed the action-heavy elements where they throw all enemies at you; it's a great way of finally using all the weapons and ammo you saved up.\n\n__Story.__ The use of hillbilly works well, and they're all crazy enough to make it crazy. I wish there were more character development as you progress in the story so you can learn even more about the family and gave personalities a bit more unique than they currently are. The switch to Evelyn as the main focus in the last chapters seemed unnecessary. It's when the game had to tie everything back to Umbrella that it went more tropey and less original than the rest of the game. The happy ending is too happy for being canon.\n\n__Gameplay.__ I love the blending of first-person horror and survival horror elements. It's not just the first-person viewpoint, but picking up of clues as you navigate a 3D environment, the sound cues with stalker enemies, and scripted scares. Survival horror elements are also enhanced. Most notable is stealth as a prominent gameplay element to dodge enemies while conserving ammo. The fight or flight mechanic with enemies (namely, should you use up your resources or just run?) is back and core to the gameplay. Crosshair aim also varies widely with recoil, healing requires an animation, you can move while reloading, and the grid inventory with items being different sizes is brought back and with new item combinations. A Guard mechanic is also used as a more deliberate paced alternative to a dodge mechanic, and where you still take damage (just significantly reduced), and where it limits your FOV and movement speed to hold it. There's sufficient although not amazing enemy variety.\n\nThe setting is excellent. I love the use of closed corridors by exploring certain houses, room by room. It not only harkens to the days of RE1-3 but also appeals to the gameplay elements set in first-person horrors like Amnesia, Alien: Isolation, and Outlast. Particular highlights in the game: early when you're still in the house; and Wrecked Ship. Old House was scary but not nearly as threatening as neither the bees nor Madeleine did much damage; and Lucas is not very imposing.\n\nStealth in horror games is a crucial gameplay element. But it's never done that well. There's ultimately a tradeoff. Good stealth games have transparent enemy alarm notifiers and other line-of-sight/hiddenness indicators, possibly more integrated into the game such as guards stating \"What was that noise?\". This bypasses the problem of inconsistency, where you can't always perfectly on just line-of-sight (and even with that, it's not clear if the sound from crouch vs walk vs run is noticed). On the other hand, horror games do benefit from some mystery around the stealth as otherwise an indicator ruins immersion and is too video gamey.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ A focus on realism, particularly with the horror immersion and uniqueness of a first-person view. The graphics are astounding for 2017, and I'm particularly impressed by the facial models. I love all the dynamic animations, seamless integrating cutscenes and gameplay/interactivity. This goes way beyond the previous titles with QTE.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ UI is minimal and immersive, with mission objectives and map relegated to the status screen and which happens in real-time.\n+ All the immersive cutscenes with seamless transitions between gameplay and cutscene. Truly adds to the tension in a way indie horror games just don't have the budget for.\n+ Replay value. Madhouse difficulty for a second playthrough, which has slight changes to item and enemy placement among other differences. You also unlock Albert-01R, which combined with Enhanced Handgun Ammo greatly speeds up early game. Like the rest of the series, there's even Madhouse+ with infinite ammo.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ They stifle your movement speed, especially when moving backwards. On one hand, it increases tension as it's much harder to kite enemies and further encourages facing head-on with just some ability to kite, or to run away. On the other hand, it's stupidly slow.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Psychostimulants. Not only are they a limited resource but also optional and discourage the more typical approach of exploring every crevice of a level. To better find things, there should be better clues if someone were to get stuck rather than needing to rely on a consumable that you then sprint around the map to find what's missing. I never used Psychostimulants.\n+ Last boss was anticlimactic. You would expect it would be gameplay-intensive given the last sections of Molded.\n+ The choice between Mia and Zoe. I'm fine with choices have little gameplay consequences as the illusion of choice is enjoyable. That said, the good vs bad ending from that choice is fairly arbitrary.\n+ [Steam overlay is bright, with brightness changing drastically between windowed and fullscreen; and you can't take screenshots](https://steamcommunity.com/app/418370/discussions/4/133255708301201140)\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Resident Evil 7 Weapon Damage Charts](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1754350187)\n+ [Resident Evil 7 walkthrough](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1870735014)\n\nThis entry does not include the DLCs (two story DLCs and Banned Footage volumes' minigames). I played on Normal difficulty. Madhouse has limited saves like the original games, and I find that mechanic more frustrating in repeating areas than tension-building. It seems more appropriate on a second playthrough, where you're not getting punished (whether it be deaths or consuming more health/ammo resources) for exploration. Key item, resource, and enemy placement also differ slightly, suggesting the game still has some novelty and which is best appreciated in that second playthrough (including the Albert 01-R).\n\nI didn't use a walkthrough unless I was stuck, but I did use it to make sure I got [all stabilizers and steroids](https://samurai-gamers.com/resident-evil-7/steroid-stabilizer-locations); I also research weapons and enemy tactics. My playthrough choices:\n\n+ Prioritized the M19 pistol over the M21 shotgun. Shotgun ammo is less frequent early game and it's a waste to use it on Molded unless you have to. On the other hand, (enhanced) handgun ammo is plenty.\n+ My Antique Coin economy was Steroid -> Stabilizer -> MAG99 (useless until endgame given scarce ammo, and Fat Molded can already die easily from Grenade Launcher or Remote Mines).\n+ I used Strong Chemic Fluid almost exclusively for Enhanced Handgun Ammo. I also frequently use Gunpowder + Handgun Ammo. Enhanced is a 3x multiplier while halving the # of bullets and using up a Gunpowder; so it's worth it if you chalk up the resource cost as equivalently 5 vs 15, and a single enhanced bullet replaces the need to hit 3 normal bullets consecutively while also incurring heavier stun.\n+ Weapon loadout is M19 handgun and M21 shotgun. More situationally: burner, P19 machine gun, remote bomb, grenade launcher.",

    "comments": "Resident Evil 5 pushes forward on the action elements of Resident Evil 4. It greatly improves controls for the better, and makes many parts of RE4's gameplay more fast-paced such as real-time healing and weapon swapping.\n\nRE5 is a decent action shooter, but even as an action shooter and not a survival horror, it suffers from numerous flaws. In particular, quite a few chapters are hit or miss (a sentry gun level, a semi-open world swamp level, two vehicle boss fights and a gimmick boss fight, and a tomb raider level); single player experience has bad AI; worse inventory management; weapon progression is gated by other weapon unlocks, with the amount of money you get during a single playthrough only enough for upgrading 3 weapons; overall world progression is bad, without any sense of a merchant and typewriter; atmosphere; and the characters and villains are even more forgettable than for Resident Evil's usual low story standards.\n\n__Story.__ Forgettable. I didn't know what was going on and didn't care to find out.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Most new to RE5 is its coop gameplay and more real-time combat. Weapons, enemies, levels, and the overall Africa setting are somewhat varied from RE4 to also present some novelty. I have mixed feelings about the coop experience as it ultimately makes for a subpar experience while trying to play solo. You have to work around Sheva's bad AI. I also think the \"downed\" state greatly diminishes the value of healing items. Instead of treating health as a conservative resource like ammo in Resident Evil games, rarely did I enjoy stocking up on health as I did in RE4. The AI would use it too often, and you would quite regularly rely on downed state for effectively extra HP.\n\nRE5 is bad as a survival horror game. There are no puzzles with managing clues and key items. It no longer has limited health and ammo with proper inventory management like in RE4. RE5 streamlines too much in this regard, making the need for ammo conservation not really a concern. The only saving grace is that the limited inventory space forces you to discard items. I wish it weren't a simple 3x3 grid however, with all items taking up 1 slot. The 3x3 grid prevents as much of RE4's weaopn variety as you can only use at most 4 weapons easily, including grenades; 3 weapons + 3 ammo already take 6 slots and on higher difficulties you use two more for the vests. In RE4, I would use 4 weapons and possibly all 3 grenades for a total of 7, alongside an accumulation of herbs and ammo. Instead of a merchant as you progress through a global map, checkpoints also simply let you buy/sell at every opportunity and with an permanent storage for infinite stocking up.\n\nAlthought there's quite the enemy variety and new designs, enemies in RE5 just aren't as good. Aside from the base enemies, many enemies have fairly strong poise (cf chainsaw man or fat guy), and the creature enemies like Dog and Licker don't really even have any melee prompts. Plagas (and the shell variant) have way too much health, and while this incentivizes more usage of the flash grenade, its limited amount of drops and lacking inventory space make flash grenades a rare blessing. The game is designed with coop in mind, where unlike RE4, you have to pass a damage threshold to stagger. I hate this approach for single player until you get to endgame with much stronger upgraded weapons when it isn't as much an issue. Crossbow enemies also shoot explosive bolts, making them a pain in the ass whereas in RE4 you would still prioritize them, but not newrly as much as you do in RE5.\n\nControl-wise, RE5 most significantly improved upon RE4's by providing strafe instead of tank controls. The game also features other improvements: higher FOV (PS4's remaster and PC with a patch), weapon and heal swap mid-combat, knife to boxes only requires one action, and you can reload without aiming. The headshot -> melee -> knife ground combo is also made faster paced here as the ground melee attack is a dedicated melee animation. The game also supports a minimap, so you don't have to go into the main menu all the time although at the cost of a more intrusive HUD. While mostly action-oriented, RE5 does still retain some of the deliberateness of classic survival horrors: for example, you must stand while aiming; and there is no manual camera control. Like RE4, it has bad QTE but amplifies the pain further by requiring QTE against certain enemies and not just cutscenes.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Strong graphics at the time, and I found it was still quite realistic in graphics playing in 2021. The game is too well-lit though, and I think it could still have been an excellent action zombie shooter but with better use of environments and lighting (see, e.g., Doom (2016)). I like the large variety in settings across chapters, although the story doesn't transition them well so you're often wondering how you arrived from a village to a swamp to a tomb to a factory.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ As an expert tactic, you can go to item menu and drag-and-drop ammo onto a weapon for instant reload. If you do this during melee animations, it requires no time.\n+ Unlike RE4 where the knee melee attack is single-target, RE5 melee combos consistently have a small AOE. There are also multiple new combos: 1 head, 2 arm, 2 legs, and ground. The melee from back on a leg combo in particular are instant kills, which is particularly useful to prevent plagas from spawning.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ The knife is nerfed compared to RE4. Much of RE4's use cases are replaced with melee combos such as stomping the ground. It's relegated to a box opener.\n+ No typewriter but rather automatic saving.\n+ In single player, Sheva basically acts like a slightly buffed-up Ashley from RE4. It's not perfect however, as sometimes you do need to rely on her AI's shooting in certain areas. Solo play is overall suboptimal.\n+ RE5 lets you replay arbitrary chapters to accumulate wealth, ammo, and heals. This is great for the coop experience of plug-and-play. It's not really great for single player continuity and game progression.\n+ Movement speed is lower when injured.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ No dedicated grenade key like a typical FPS. This is all the more paramount in RE5 where weapon swaps happen in real-time and there is limited inventory space. Instead they dedicate a key to the useless knife.\n+ El Gigante fight is awful. Plays like a rail shooter as is another vehicle boss fight. Chapter 5-1's Uroboros is also a tedious fight in 60 fps due to a physics bug calculating flamethrower FPS. And the Wesker and Jill fight is gimmicky. Last two boss fights are rocket launcher fights.\n+ Game doesn't work out of the box. You have to work around [Games for Windows Live](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=864823595) using a variety of fan solutions. Linked is an unofficial patch that also fixes issues such as pathing, provides the PS4 HD Remaster's larger FOV and shadows, and borderless windowed. Sensitivity is also really high. To approximate Overwatch settings, I set my mouse to toggle to 400 DPI, and I use 1 mouse sensitivity. I toggle back to 800 DPI for menu and desktop browsing.\n+ You can't unbind certain keys such as Reload (S+Shift), and you can catch yourself accidentally pressing it a few times.\n+ You can only strafe in walking speed.\n+ Needless cover mechanic.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Items and Weapons](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_5/Items_and_weapons)\n\nMy first playthrough was solo and on Veteran difficulty. I played on mouse and keyboard as I greatly prefer a mouse's precision over an analog stick for aim even though QTE is bad (and even more prominent in this game than RE4). I unbinded my Reload key and instead reload from inventory, with 4-6 rebound to slots 7-9 so that ammo is directly below the weapon.\n\nMy favored loadout is M92F (to unlock M93R, which is my preference as a blend between a Machine Gun and handgun, and with highest DPS), Ithaca (to unlock Hydra, which has the highest DPS as attack range actually increases number of pellets, and blasts people farthest), Dragunov SVD (highest DPS at the cost of sway which I can manage with mouse aim), ammo, grenades, vest. I made Sheva a healbot, handling my heal items and any remaining ammo; I also gave her a machine gun to force those to drop ammo and let her use it and stun rod as an infinite ammo weapon. In Chapters 5 and 6, I felt the game was too frustrating. So I swapped from my starter pistol and shotgun to M93R and Hydra by farming Chapter 3-1.",

    "comments": "Resident Evil 4 overhauled the series toward an arcade shooter with action-heavy elements, with for example a third-person view, crowds of enemies at a time, larger weapon variety, and upgrades. It especially features high replayability with higher difficulties and its weapon variety, enabling different playstyles.\n\n__Story.__ I like RE4's idea of being fairly standalone, more detached than others in the series and therefore enabling itself to work without the legacy requirements of corresponding to Umbrella. It's a fairly blockbluster story, nothing that stands out much.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Particularly notable in RE4's action elements are: body part damage (the core combo of head or lower leg shot -> kick the enemy down -> knife until dead; lower leg shot for immediate knockdown of enemies rushing you), context-sensitive actions, quick time events, ability to slash at enemies when they're down to further conserve ammo, health, inventory, and weapon upgrades, and merchants, currency, and treasure collectibles. Weapon variety is excellent. There are multiple viable paths to take down enemies in the game, and like other strong classic games like Super Mario 64, RE4 allows expert players to carve their own style.\n\nResident Evil series has always had great enemy variety, but RE4 pushes it even further. As an action game, RE4 enables significantly more variable enemies such as plagas, invisible rushing enemies (novistadors), shields, regenerators, J.J., chainsaw enemies, Garrador. I also like the dynamism in the level designs, not only with verticality but the ability to break down doors, push down ladders, and knife at destructible objects. These levels really assist in controlling the large groups of zombies you fight.\n\nControls age decently well. The FOV, tank controls, and standing in order to aim/reload are limiting but don't feel too constraining playing the game in 2021. RE4 tries to reach a middleground between classical survival horror like RE1 and typical action shooters. Other controls such as knife, gun, action, and run are simple and intuitive. What I find doesn't age well however is swapping weapons mid-fight by going to the menu (even grenades). Modern standards enable shortcuts to not ruin the combat pace.\n\nCarrying around Ashley as an escort for much of the game seems a huge flaw on first glance. It doesn't actually hamper gameplay in practice. Intensive fights have obvious hiding areas for Ashley or otherwise make her not appear for story reasons. Less intensive fights are slightly more challenging as you have to be careful about positioning with Ashley as a second target next to you.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ A blur of somewhat cartoony and realistic graphics. Ages pretty well to be honest. Atmosphere in the game is lacking overall, with less of an emphasis on sound design, lighting, and ominous background music. Everything is well-lit.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ The wide viability of the knife for ammo conservation: knifing at traps, enemies when they're down, breakable objects to get at their loot.\n+ Loading screens are seamless.\n+ Most all areas have finite enemy spawn.\n+ Plagas appear with a higher chance if your playstyle involves shooting heads. Excellent counter tactic, balancing in favor of other playstyles like aiming for legs or not going for the risky combo. On the other hand, knee shot staggers don't always work, and the suplex action only affects one target while adding +30% chance decapitation. This means shooting the head is generally better for the crowd control unless your aim is closer to the knee, they have head armor, they rush you, or it's single target. (It turns out this detail is not actually true, although I wish it were!)\n+ Upgrades are gated with game progression. This is good for balancing as it prevents focusing too much on one gun.\n+ You can try to minmax health and ammo by waiting for certain plot progression where all health is restored, or to use full health heals; and ammo upgrades to restock or before selling.\n+ As part of its survival horror roots, you cannot buy ammo or beyond carrying 2 first aid sprays. Otherwise there would be no feeling of limited health or ammo. (And true to its action genre, RE4 has plentiful of both if you play conservatively.)\n+ You can kill snakes and crows for drops.\n+ The Combine feature of different Herbs set the standard for the franchise.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ The game is a bit more forgiving than past games, with Continue proceeding to the last checkpoint rather than the last save.\n+ No Item Box like in previous games. Instead, the attache is large enough.\n+ Key items and treasure do not take inventory space.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Item drops despawn. Forces you to pick them up during battle.\n+ Map includes an explicit mission marker. That's just a little too streamlined in action for my tastes. The levels are already designed linearly enough that you don't need explicit markers.\n+ Save, merchant, and lore items are a little too video game-y in their placement. Lore items also nonsensically reveal the enemy's entire plan to you. I think you can make a great action survival horror like RE4 but without the more arcade elements.\n+ Red Catseye is only accessible before you can get the treasure map. This is the only treasure that requires knowing its location beforehand.\n+ No native borderless support. Windowed + Borderless Gaming worked easily though (and sometimes Shift+Tab first to open the Steam overlay to get my mouse control back).\n+ No English subtitles.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [The Definitive Tactics Guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=807923566)\n+ [The Definitive Weapons Guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=731850249)\n\nI played a little in high school (2006) as Danny and Dalton were very into the game, but I never went far. Playing the game again, I played the Ultimate HD Edition on PC, which includes the latest HD remastering, supporting 60 fps (although QTE now requires twice as many button presses as it was designed for 30; and certain animations are janky), 4K rendering, widescreen, and texture mods. I play on controller as RE4 was designed for it; I prefer mouse and keyboard but the tank controls and limited FOV make it unlike modern FPS; QTE and poor inventory management controls further hamper the M+KB experience. I played on Normal.\n\nMy loadout is Red9 (basic enemies), Striker (crowd control and nearby strong enemies), Semi-Auto Rifle (strong enemies and enemies from long distance), Broken Butterfly (strong enemies, typically bosses). In survival games, I prefer damage per ammo rather than damage per second as I often don't spam shots in favor of making each bullet count. I don't really use grenades as I find the shotgun and roundhouse kick sufficient; flash grenades are great for one-shotting a ton of plagas; and I carry 1 incendiary for emergencies. Instead of being completionist, I collected all treasure explicitly marked on my map and while navigating; but I didn't use walkthroughs if, e.g., I missed a spinel treasure or yellow herb.",

    "comments": "I love Resident Evil's atmosphere. It solidified key elements of the survival horror genre: limited inventory space, limited ammo encouraging you to deliberate between killing zombies and avoiding them, exploration, atmosphere, specific locations for (limited) saves and item boxes, minimal HUD, enemy variety. \n\nFlaw-wise, I found the backtracking, particularly in the search of locked doors that are now unlocked with a new key, to be tedious. Especially with the limited resources, this encouraged a gameplay of wasting a playthrough searching for the optimal path, then resetting to do those steps without wasting resources going around zombies to navigate. That said, Resident Evil makes some ingenious uses of backtracking, adding enemy ambushes to avoid your lull in revisiting past areas. In general, resource management and puzzle-solving make survival horror one of my least interested genres to play---in favor of RE's more action-oriented sequels which push further on body part damage, viable melee. But when I am in the mood, it's quite the thrill.\n\n__Story.__ Serviceable. I particularly like the lore spread throughout the game as you navigate, even with descriptions of miscellaneous assets. This is one of the minor details that truly add to its atmosphere.\n\n__Gameplay.__ With its constant backtracking, slowly opening up new areas as you accumulate keys, Resident Evil is true to its horror roots, with later indie horror games taking a similar approach. The simple 4-state health system and use of health consumables work well. Core weaponry with their own ammo type and defensive items work well.\n\nTrue to its survival theme, resource management is crucial. Even saves require a limited resource. On one side, I find this annoying, but there is enough ink; you just can't save everytime you're near the save room. I like that this encourages tension. But particularly with all the backtracking in exploration, it makes navigation tedious at times as you dodge zombies to see if a locked door is now open. Resource management overall encourages me to simply hoard: ink, shotgun shells, grenade launcher shells, magnum bullets. By the time I faced the Tyrant, I had 24 magnum bullets, 12 acid shells, 6 grenade shells, and a ridiculous amount of health consumables in my chest (12+).\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The fixed camera angles age pretty well. It adds horror to not seeing what you'd like to see and unique enemy placement for ambushes (e.g., a mirror to let you peek if you're astute). Combat, particularly with aiming the head or legs, and transitioning between fixed camera angles for kiting, is clunky.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ The door loading screens slow the pace and add tension.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Enemy placement resets when you re-enter a zone. Makes for predictable video game-y behavior instead of them camping the door you just exited.\n+ It's interesting that the tank controls are universally hated. But the fixed cameras are universally adored. I can see why that these angles offer some useful detachment adding to the atmosphere, and with the potential for ambushes. It still leads to a bad control system though.\n+ Crimson Heads. Further punishment for killing zombies, particularly given the riskiness of headshots with RNG and limited resources for burning zombies (even carrying a handgun, lighter, and kerosene takes 3/8 slots!).\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Game supports a maximum of 1920x1440p resolution, with everything else upscaled. Borderless is possible with Borderless Gaming although it creates a mouse offset, making mouse and keyboard not viable. Max FPS is 60.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nThis entry does not include the minigames (extra content), only the campaign. I played the 2015 high-definition remake, on controller as the game was developed for PlayStation, Normal difficulty, as Jill, and with a walkthrough to tell me what's now unlocked. Because the 16:9 aspect ratio just crops, I played in the original 4:3. The Director's Cut on PlayStation offers the best content and higher difficulties, but has wonkier controls due to turn left/right instead of strafe left/right.",

    "comments": "CSGO is a modern enhancement of CS. It emphasizes mechanics core to twitch shooting: low time to kill, positioning, intricate aim and movement complexity, and search and destroy as the competitive game mode. Unfortunately, it has one of the most toxic communities (e.g., more than Overwatch, on par with League of Legends). The game is also rife with hacking as the Anti-Cheat system sucks, with only compromises to solve it (trust factor, Overwatch, VACnet, Prime Status).\n\n__Gameplay.__ Plays just like Counter Strike with its dated movement and as a twitch shooter. The aim, damage, and movement mechanics are simple but profoundly deep: low time to kill, 400% headshot damage and other limb damage multipliers, precise burst aim over spray shooting (and controlling for spray patterns), standing and movement decreases aim, slow reload time while reloading slows your movement speed, wall shot damage, movement sound, movement has acceleration, static health and armor, buy inventory, and gun damage tapers off over distance. There's a lot of emergent patterns from these ideas. For example, the massive headshot damage encourages headshots as the primary target as it's the quickest time to kill; crouching is encouraged as a way to dodge headshots; counterstrafing (unpredictable AD strafing with timed pauses for aiming); accounting for the spray pattern and using different shooting patterns with tap, 2/3-burst, and spray depending on the range. Strategic usage of smoke, incendiary, and flashbang grenades is important for positioning.\n\nSearch and destroy is the predominant game map. There aren't any competitive modes outside search and destroy, and even casual mode is too casual, largely with imbalanced teams and bots---you can even switch teams. This is for good and bad as CSGO defines these simple core and forces you to master them to their limits to perform well. Team composition is also largely homogeous, with the only variety being where your teammates take positions and what weapons they buy; there is no difference in health or damage stats.\n\nCSGO features a community mode with custom maps, and there's quite a few that actually age quite well and remain highly played: surfing/bhopping maps for example.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Looks just like Counter-Strike but smoothened and newer models. Animations remain just as static.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ CS:GO meta-wise gives peekers the advantage rather than campers.\n+ Movement speed encouraged the entire meta of bunny hopping.\n+ Pre-shooting, such as shooting through known corners during a smoke grenade, or shooting through obstacles that you suspect an enemy might camp.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ N/A\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ It's more of a legacy feature that people have gotten accustomed to now that only a subset of the weapons are used at all. Most are not viable.\n+ There is a soft cap of XP gain per week after which you get reduced week. One of many artificial incentives for regular engagement.\n+ Released prior to Overwatch, it misses the endorsement system and quick communication options to improve teamplay.\n+ Casual mode is quite different from competitive in a number of ways: for example, 10 instead of 5 players on each team, refereshed armor and defusal kit every round, different economy, different timer. It also has no Overwatch, making hackers in casual not uncommon.\n+ Taking the silencer off any gun is never viable. It just reduces accuracy and reveals your shots.\n+ Competitive matches typically last 40-45 minutes. I prefer Overwatch match lengths of roughly 30 minutes. You get sick of playing with the same people, particularly if there's negativity or a losing streak.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [3kliksphilip's CS:GO Basic Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfwtcDG7LpxGeQUBNIQHTNsSBrjzi2jX0)\n+ [CS:GO Movement Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGcgQEzCCrI)",

There are really only certain mainstream tasks, but the variety is excellent. Performing well across a targeted collection is like performing daily physical exercises where you target individual body parts. Here, it's flicking, tracking, speed, and precision. You can further make a playlist to cycle the set of exercises instead of overoptimizing for one repeatedly.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Just enough detail to make the UI and gameplay feel modern in textures. Also tons of customization with weapon models, animations and sounds, and backgrounds to make the trainer feel more immersive as if it was within the video game you're practicing for.\n\n__Details I dislike:__\n\n+ While there's a leaderboard for every task to compare performance to top performance globally, there is no understanding of real-world comparison to the general population. This can be done by simply showing the score distribution of every task and giving you a percentile rank.\n+ The idea of Insights is cool, but the specific higlighted strengths and weaknesses don't seem accurate. For example, it's very easy to get Flickmaster.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nNot really a game, but I'm adding it here in order to provide my comments about aiming trainers. Aim trainers are perfect for idling such as watching a stream or while you want to relax a bit after playing a bunch of intense Overwatch matches or are waiting in queue. I never practiced seriously on Aim Lab like a regular exercise that you would for physical activity or learning a language---only casually during idle time. I'd rather just grind the game I'd like to improve on itself as it's all-encompassing and more fun. Kovaak is another popular aim trainer, but I dislike that it's paid and I found the game felt even less polished than Aim Lab when I tried it for roughly an hour. From Steam stats as of 2021, Aim Lab is also 3x more popular with roughly 6k daily players. FPoSu is another excellent contender which Surefour recommends, and while it's 2D and less realistic and diverse than aim trainers, it's fun.",

    "comments": "Half-Life 2 pushes the series as the frontier of the cinematic linear FPS experience. It's excellent across graphics, physics engine with light platforming and puzzles (the particular novel contribution to the genre), cinematic storytelling, and enemy variety. Flaw-wise, I found Half-Life 2 put too much time into driving, boating, and platforming with looming chopper enemies going on for much longer than they should be. This slowed down the pace even further than Half-Life 1's core loop of navigating new environments, encountering enemies, some light puzzles/clues, and shooting. And Half-Life 2's weapon arsenal is weak. Half-Life 2 is often touted for its storytelling, and while I do like that it's placed here and there as you progress, not unlike Half-Life 1 and for good and bad, it's actually fairly skeletal as a way to transition levels.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The core gameplay is the same with combat while navigating linear environments, light puzzle solving and platforming, and the occasional survival horror. Particularly notable to Half-Life 2 is the Gravity Gun and more open environments, with diverse variety going beyond the Half-Life 1's corridor shooter. The Gravity Gun has a lot of environmental and damage use cases, which I quite enjoyed. It's clearly the predecessor to the Portal Gun. Half-Life 2 also pushes further in destructible environments with your crowbar and environment interaction like barrels to distract the Barnacles. There's plenty variety in each level to keep the game fresh (e.g., antlions in Sandtraps and squads in Anticitizen One).\n\nThe ammo management can be tedious in certain levels like Ravenholm. What makes this more frustrating if it was aimed as a survival horror theme is that there is plentiful health pickups. This effectively encourages you to just use the crowbar as you can be a sponge for many hits, and crowbaring most of a level is not an engaging experience.\n\nThe weapon arsenal is fairly average for the genre: pistol, SMG, shotgun (only introduced in Chapter 6/13). The SMG does too little damage and wastes a lot of ammo. There's no weapon recoil or aim precision based on movement. There is no real medium-to-long-range weapon, which the game positions itself in its levels most of the time. The SMG does too little damage particularly at this range, and the crossbow has too little ammo.\n\nI dread the Airboat. The escape from the helicopter levels with it are unbearable to me. It's a weird platforming section separate from the core FPS and which I find more annoying than a breath of fresh air. Unlike Halo which integrated the vehicle into the core gameplay and showcasing more open environments, Half-Life 2 uses vehicles more as interludes which I don't think works well.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The detail ages surprisingly well with the facial models, textures, and lighting. It's quite clearly an upgrade from other 2004 games like World of Warcraft, MGS3, and Halo 2.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ There's a realistic heroine in both personality and body proportions.\n+ Automatic checkpointing as well as supporting old school manual quicksave system.\n+ The overpowered Gravity Gun at the end.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ RPGs shot at the gunships is just RNG whether they really hit. It's a dumb minigame of guiding the rocket.\n+ Chucking grenades into the Combine Ground Turrets. It's annoying to aim and with only 5 ammo, so you may as well savescum.\n+ Loading screen locations to separate levels can feel somewhat arbitrary, pulling you out of the immersion.\n+ I'm so spoiled by CSGO aim and movement mechanics that I sorely miss the precise aim on the first shot followed by imprecision from spray patterns, movement decreasing aim, movement acceleration, and 400% headshot damage multiplier. This incentivizes players to find cover, fire in bursts, and peek rather than shoot while moving.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI first played this game in 2004 and did not get very far.

    "comments": "Thief (2014) offers some fun as a AAA stealth game with elements borrowed from Thief, Dishonored, Assassin's Creed, and Uncharted. Ultimately, it leans too much toward streamlining, with the biggest problems being its linear level design, lack of enemy variety, and a collection of minor ones that hamper the experience (e.g., focus mode, of which disabling can make the rare area nonintuitive to navigate).\n\n__Story.__ The story is criticized by the community, and I agree it's forgettable. Most video game stories are bad though, and to be fair, the depth or nuance in this game's storytelling is not much different than Thief 1, Styx, Assassin's Creed, or Hitman. Dishonored does have identifiable characters with a history though.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Thief (2014) performs the core thief loop well of searching for loot, navigating areas, and stealthing past guards. It inherits Thief mechanics such as its weapon arsenal with blackjack and arrow variety, light system, different surfaces requiring one to move slowly to avoid being heard, lockpicking minigame, core controls, bad combat, and documents. It also integrates Dishonored and Assassin's Creed elements. A particularly new mechanic is Swoop, which quickly moves Garret a short distance in order to move cover to cover---like a gimped Dishonored's Blink. I think this mechanic works well. It adds to Garret feeling more nimble like a true thief; the longclaw, increased movement speed, and the general level design's asset placement to enable verticality also attest to this.\n\nThief (2014) leans too much to Dishonored, Assassin's Creed, and Uncharted in the style of mainstream stealth games rather than its Thief roots. For example: very linear level design with little forking paths; focus mode; minimap; there's a generic audio cue when a guard's awareness is rising rather than more immersive sound cues (\"huh?\", \"What was that?\"); a hub with collectibles; rope arrows are delegated to very specific locations, lacking the original game's flexibility in any wooden area; you can't jump on arbitrary assets as they're literally invisible walls or jump off arbitrary ledges. The blackjack is relegated to a takedown button, and while I like that it's a guaranteed one-hit, it restricts melee takedowns to be nonlethal instead of offering the choice. Enemy variety is also poor.\n\nProgression system-wise, Thief offers focus, tool, and trinket upgrades. I'm ambivalent whether they're worth having: the original Thief game didn't, but it also felt a little repetitive without that sense of progression through the game. Thief also features side missions outside the main levels with Basso and client jobs. I think side missions are great to enable some variety. The client jobs do this well but Basso's jobs are glorified fetch quests.\n\nHUD-wise, it's minimalistic like the original games which I like. The alert system now has a visual indicator on an enemy. I'm ambivalent whether the original Thief series' non-visuals necessarily made this more immersive through the reliance of only sound design or whether the lack of visuals made it more difficult. There are also now explicit objective markers like Dishonored, and I prefer this streamlining to an extent, as long as the markers are not micromanaging you but orient you toward a vague direction. Thief's item inventory no longer exists, which I greatly prefer as it required rather tedious management in cycling through it.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The textures and overall city environments feel significantly more lived-in than the previous games. Modern graphics engines also improve lighting. I also like that Thief finally has animations for various things you do: pick items up, climb ladders, etc. Thief 1 lacked this and felt janky instead.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Opened closets and cupboards are no longer interactable after you've searched it. Helps when you're navigating an open area and forget if you've already checked something.\n+ You can pickpocket a guard's items while he/she's patroling. This is like Dishonored---I don't remember if it was possible in original Thief.\n+ Custom difficulty and HUD settings. Allows for a significant amount of replayability and also finetune your level of preferred streamlining in stealth games (e.g., focus, objective markers).\n+ Unlike prior Thief titles, enemies can carry torches.\n+ Thief (2014) furthers the idea of variable sound depending on the surface with you knocking down jars and stepping on glass if you're not careful. I wish they had more surface textures making different sounds like Thief 1 in order to make this more of a challenge in the game, such as wood and metal making larger sounds than stone.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Thieving challenges. They add more challenge but it's also an artificial arcade element.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Focus vision highlights interactable objects. I dislike this as it's effectively the video game's Detective mode. It disincentivizes actually sneaking around an area to see what blinks that you can steal or what you can climb up. I turned it off, but you can clearly tell certain areas were designed with focus in mind, particularly with assets you haven't seen as interactable before (e.g., a cog next to the side of a water pipe).\n+ Peeking mechanic requires first pressing Interact close to a wall and then leaning left/right. I much prefer the simpler and more flexible approach of always allowing peaking---wall or not.\n+ Object highlights. I dislike the blue outline as it ruins the game's environment, and it's necessary so you can't turn it off because you can't tell what you can jump/interact with otherwise.\n+ It's a little ridiculous that Garret is stealing a bunch of petty items rather than fewer but more expensive items like in Thief 1. For gameplay reasons, I can see the reason to percolate loot in the same way that the original games do. The amount of gold and the items themselves however are measly (with that said, the original Thief gets around this by having Diamonds unrealistically scattered around).\n+ For a Thief game with a connected world, there's too many loading screens.\n+ Gold is used for not only upgrades but also resources (e.g., arrows) which are not enough in quantity from picking them up. This encourages conservative itemless playthroughs rather than a set items every level in Thief games. Dishonored got around this by not having items altogether.\n+ Boss fights. They're so annoying to play.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Safes](https://primagames.com/walkthrough/thief-how-unlock-all-safes-and-vaults)\n\nI played on Master (highest) difficulty and disabled Focus mode and minimap. I did a ghost playstyle, not doing any takedowns unless forced to. Upgrade-wise, I prioritized new abilities and long-term budget ones (Basso's Bond, Wrench, Razor, Wirecutter). I played some but not all side missions as I found the game fairly repetitive.",

    "comments": "Thief pioneered the stealth genre alongside Metal Gear Solid and Tenchu; and was also a great influencer to immersive sims. Compared to its successor Thief 2, Thief 1 emphasizes exploration and not only burglary (arguably half-exploration half-stealth). To Thief fans, tomb raiding is a core part of the appeal: getting lost in a level's mazes and making progress with a mental map using your compass, memory, and barebones map.\n\nPlaying it in 2019 and 2021, there are three major faults: 1. clues or maze navigation can be too vague and necessitate playing with a walkthrough (see examples below); 2. undead levels forgo stealth in favor of maze navigation; and 3. level progression has bad pacing.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Thief established standards like light with interactable objects, shadows, and a light percentage bar; sound based on movement speed and surfaces; emergent gameplay from enemy AI and open maps with many approaches; first-person stealth; and a quick save system. There's also many nice details. For example, you can snuff out torches (which Styx inherited) but not electric lights. Surfaces like carpet or marble make different sounds. The utility items are great: water arrow for taking out torches; moss arrows to not make noise on marble/stone; noisemaker arrows for drawing guards (too bad you can't do it like Dishonored of just whacking your sword at the wall). The map is a piece of paper which you annotate, not a GPS like modern games (that said, a very rough one) and which Dishonored inherited.\n\nThe controls are simple and age well. You alternate between run, walk, and crouch. Jump, attack, block, cycle items, use item, and lean left/right provides corner views (like Dishonored). Number keys select specific weapons. Swordplay provides control to swing right, left, or overhead. Item inventory.\n\nThief's equipment provides a diverse toolkit consisting of mostly excellent items. The blackjack is the mainstay melee weapon: while undetected, it can nonlethally one-hit an enemy. Gas Arrows and Gas Mines provide ranged nonlethal means. Utility equipment include water arrows to snuff out torches, fires, and wash away blood; moss arrows to provide quiet surfaces to walk on; rope arrows to climb onto a wooden surfaces; noisemaker arrows to cause a diversion; lockpicks; and holy water to turn water arrows to kill the undead. Equipment for last-resort combat are an arming sword, broadhead arrows (which can one-hit lethal from undetected status and also lure enemies if you hit metal), fire arrows, flashbombs, and explosive mines.\n\nLevels are hit or miss. Many levels stray too much into maze navigation with few enemies: Bonehoard, Haunted Cathedral, Lost City, Return to Cathedral, Maw of Chaos to a lesser degree. Level progression can also be obtuse. For example: Lord Bafford's Manor has items hidden behind cloth banners: 1. there's no indicator that you can cut them; and 2. there's no way you'd know outside of an occasional guard's conversation. Thieves' Guild has confusing orientation in not explaining that you first need to acquire Donnel's safe key from Reuben's house; then retrieve the vase from Donnel's safe in Donnel's house. Haunted Cathedral requires lighting two torches next to a statue; and if you don't have two Fire Arrows, game over. Let's not even talk about Lost City, which I have no idea how you could navigate with its winding paths and unintuitive roof climbing/house holes. Return to Cathedral has convoluted fetch quests. The sequencing of the levels also have awful pacing.\n\nUndead levels are the worst part of Thief. Zombies are not typically stealthable in the areas they're placed, they cannot be knocked out, and they resurrect infinitely. They force combat or running away, as they can only die with water arrows with holy water, fire arrows, or flashbombs, all of which have limited ammo. Undead levels serve as a reminder that the Thief series originally didn't know what it wanted to be. Undead levels no longer exist in Thief II and for good reason.\n\nCompared to Dishonored, Thief has its own identity: it's different, not better or worse. Garret plays like a true thief, stealing key items, looting, and in Thief 1, tomb raiding. He's weak when spotted, rarely able to take more than a single enemy at a time. In contrast, Corvo plays like a true assassin: taking out key targets, and with the ability to kill when caught. They also share similar stealth toolkits and the underlying stealth system, but Garret's emphasizes environmental interaction (lighting/sound) and Corvo's emphasizes movement/line of sight (e.g., Blink) and other creative supernatural powers, opening up the level design to enable even more diverse approaches than Thief while still preserving architectural realism.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ As an early 3D game, the 800x600 resolution, polygon textures, lack of animations such as grappling and climbing, long empty corridors, and asset resuse do not age well. Even in 1998, the game was panned for its graphics compared to, say, Quake II. Albeit large, areas are often empty feeling more like mazes than real buildings (and the lack of a real-time map makes you further lost). I do like the overall dark art direction which fits the game, and the varied settings: mansions, prisons, abandoned cities, catacombs, and strange mage towers. The directional sound design to notify of you enemies walking by, their alertness, and where work well.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Light indicator. Most all stealth games ought to have a version of this. Otherwise like in Dishonored, you just crouch and somehow automatically go in stealth mode without having an idea of how much until guards are alerted.\n+ The HUD is just right in minimalism, with health, light indicator, weapon, and item.\n+ Difficulty levels don't just change stats like in other games. They add more enemies, new or stricter objectives, and less HP. This means to experience the full content of a level, you want Expert difficulty. Note the alertness or toughness of an enemy doesn't change though.\n+ You can skip levels with Ctrl+Shift+Alt+End. I wish there were more cheats though similar to Doom, or better yet Elder Scrolls such as the ability to modify movement speed.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Save system is manual. There are no checkpoints/autosave. This is part for the course for the time, like Doom and Quake.\n+ Items and money do not carry over missions.\n+ You can pick up the Broadhead Arrow and Rope Arrow after their use.\n+ No guard alertness indicator. Instead guards provide audio cues, which I think is better for immersion although it leads to confusing behavior at times, and you have an explicit light indicator.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Gold is tracked as an item that you have to cycle through.\n+ You can't go nonlethal when confronted. This makes Expert difficulty impossible without savescumming as alerts effectively mean game over.\n+ No guard alert indicator. You have to guestimate.\n+ Max resolution is 800x600, fullscreen, and there are no cutscenes. Fortunately, the TFix mod fixes this. For borderless, I set TFix with [windowed](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Thief:_The_Dark_Project#Windowed).\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [TFix](https://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=134733)\n+ http://www.thief-thecircle.com/guides/keeperchapel, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm6RtQAof4E\n+ [Thief vs AAA Gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/3bjrze/thief_vs_aaa_gaming) | It's ranty, but he highlight specific elements well: indicate progress not via quest markers and a minimap but clues and player exploration; incenvitize agency via clues and realistic levels which immerse you, not game-y aspects like loot in some corner that doesn't make sense realistically; more subtle storytelling; movement mechanics like the rope arrow is done more realistically by the roof's material (wood), not context-specific assets; focus on core minimal tools all of which are applicable; other parts of the video are ranty or only specific to stealth.\n\nI played the Thief Gold (1999) edition. I used the TFix Lite mod, which improves system mechanics for a modern PC (e.g., 21:9 resolution, borderless) based on the NewDark game engine. I chose not to use TFix which also improves textures/special effects using Thief 2's as [that changes the original atmosphere](https://www.reddit.com/r/Thief/comments/c88g66/playing_thief_gold_for_the_first_time). One caveat is that because of the NewDark game engine, both TFix and TFix Lite uses Thief 2 AI which is not authentic ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Thief/comments/9prlz4/how_can_i_get_the_most_original_experience_on_a), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Thief/comments/a0igj7/original_thief_gold_ai)).\n\nFor controls, I changed to Dishonored-like keybindings: W for Run, hold Shift to Walk, C for Crouch, F for Use Item, Left Mouse for Attack, Right Mouse for Block, Q, Alt + W, and E for Lean Left, Forward, and Right. Controls separate from Dishonored are item inventory management with Z, X, and Tab for previous, next, and use item, R for Drop, Shift + F for Sheath Weapon (can't map it to Hold F as in Dishonored).\n\nI played on Expert difficulty (the highest) for two episodes and Normal for the rest. Immersion is my priority, and I'd rather experience the full challenge and content in a level on future playthroughs, where levels otherwise feel drawn out. I first picked up the game on 8/22/19 and abandoned it after 2 missions. I couldn't stand getting lost (and without a second monitor to refer to walkthroughs, or Twitch streams to keep getting lost not being annoying), and the exploration component which makes Thief part walking simulator. I picked it up again on 2/21/21.",

    "comments": "Released in the same year as Quake 2 under the rising trend of 3D shooters, Doom 64 did not garner much of an audience. It presents little new to the series: no major enemies, weapons, or approaches to level design. Instead, Doom 64 is like a refined Doom game, putting a final close on what Doom 1 and 2 did well under a new set of levels, all comprising new assets developed for the Nintendo 64. For this goal, Doom 64 achieves it quite well. The game does get slightly repetitive because of this, and quite a few levels are too nonintuitive.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Core gameplay remains the same with the same weapons and anemies. Enemy variety is in fact slightly less than Doom II's due to Nintendo 64's memory limitations. The weapon arsenal overall is excellent, leveraging the best of Doom 2 (Super Shotgun); and one new weapon is the Unmaker (described later). Level design is noticeably more consistent without the contrived levels that Doom II offers. Doom 64 thus enables the best of both worlds: Doom 2 weapon and enemy arsenal, and Doom 1 level design.\n\nThe Unmaker is an interesting new weapon. Because the Unmaker is a third weapon using cell ammo, it serves closer to an upgrade to the Plasma Rifle instead of an entirely new weapon, with better damage per shot with zero Demon Keys to also higher DPS after attaining one Demon Key. It's also an overall more versatile weapon than the BFG9000, eventually even better when you attain 3 Demon Keys. The Unmaker brings Doom 64 to an excellent diversity of weapons: Super Shotgun for shells; Chaingun for bullets; Rocket Launcher for rockets; and Unmaker for cells.\n\nSome level progression is nonintuitive. For example, MAP08's access to the yellow card by pressing Interact on a yellow light, MAP17's random running around tiles to trigger the blue skull key spawn, MAP18's shooting the switch for the blue skull key and pressing Interact on a bookshelf for the yellow skull key (neither mechanic has been done in previous Doom games or is a frequent one that gamers can expect), MAP27's notoriously stupid keycode puzzle at the end of the map. The spawning of quite a handful of big enemies also gets rather repetitive and dumb, e.g., seven hell knights, three Pain Elementals. This is also common in Doom II, and generally a pit trap in Doom endgame where there's not much else you can do to ramp up the difficulty.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Doom 64's engine is distinct from previous games, including new textures and sprites. Sound design is excellent with a distorted grungy soundtrack, chanting, and other horrific atmosphere---almost reminiscent of Quake 1 rather than Doom 1 and 2's rock soundtrack. It's more colorful overall, and lighting is more pronounced with general darkness. There aren't weapon animations like the iconic super shotgun cocking due to Nintendo 64's memory limitations; that's a shame! Weapon sounds do feel strong as always, and not like Doom 3's muffled ones. For the PC rerelease, I'm thoroughly enjoying the game at my native widescreen resolution (2560x1440p), borderless, 144hz, and with precise mouse aim.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ That satisfying feeling of one-shotting a pinky demon with the Super Shotgun.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Movement is floaty, with slow deceleration making it very momentum-based.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Homing rocket traps and Mother Demon's homing rockets. They move way too fast, just slightly below your strafe-and-move-forward speed.\n+ The flashing lights in certain areas (e.g., MAP04). My god does that hurt to see.\n+ Fuck Lost Souls. They're even more aggressive in this game.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [How to Remove Intro Videos](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2146176046) | Boy, and I thought Doom 3's with both Bethesda and id Software was annoying!\n+ [How to use the keybind menu](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2038529533) | Specifically, how to unbind keys.\n\nI played the 2020 PC rerelease. This entry does not include the Lost Levels. I played on Watch Me Die! (hardest) difficulty as reading online, it's the equivalent of Ultra-Violence as Doom 64 omits a Nightmare difficulty. No mouse smoothing, no mouse acceleration, 8.5in/180 mouse sensitivity, mouselook but no freelook, no crosshair, autoaim on, always run, filtering (default) to mimick Nintendo 64 rendering, no antialiasing. I prefer freelook, crosshair, and no autoaim in my classic Dooms, but the option isn't available in the rerelease; and I may as well experience the vanilla setup first. I saved intermittently during levels as they're fairly long.",

    "comments": "Doom 3 is a different experience than its Doom predecessors. It works quite well as a linear horror corridor shooter, with particularly good lighting and sound design---along the lines of F.E.A.R. and Dead Space which were released a few years later. Doom 3 also inherits several of the Doom franchise's traits that work well: enemy design and the iconic weapon arsenal.\n\nWhat I dislike most about Doom 3 are the frequent ambush from behind tactics, frequently with no game design clues to notify you that enemies are there; and the terrible shotgun that not only renders a core weapon nonviable but severely limits the diversity of the other weapons. Doom 3 also provides the worst combat of the series. There's little variety in the playstyle as you peek from corners, back up on any enemy spawns, and shoot your mid-ranged weapon. Enemy variety doesn't do much either: Imps can now jump in your face which is fine, but most of the new enemies (Cherubs, Wraiths, Ticks, Trites) also do this where there main attack is melee, adding little variety as interchangeable enemies.\n\n__Story.__ It tries to play like Half-Life with a linear narrative and NPCs, but with horror elements. Also includes audio logs you pick up like System Shock. The story is still forgettable with not much lore or interesting villains.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Doom 3 does not play like other Doom games. There are multiple Doomisms that don't appear: many enemies, always run, circle strafing, shotgun as the main weapon (here, the Machine Gun shines), monster infighting. Instead, Doom 3 a linear corridor horror shooter. Lighting adds to the atmosphere with deliberate limitations of the flashlight. Sound design is also important to alert you to an enemy's proximity. There are just a handful of enemies you encounter at a time. Because many enemies are hitscan and reloading take a long time, the game encourages corner peeking and playing cautiously. Movement and reloading feels more sluggish in favor of realism and atmosphere. There's fairly plentiful ammo and health pickups. Health stations and various combat armor pickups also let you reset to max health and armor.\n\nI despise the ambushes from behind. In general, ambushes are great in moderation, particularly if they're in your frontal view. What's the worst are enemies either spawning or appearing from closets behind you, without any sound to notify you that that they're there. They can also appear in front of you, but in melee range as you open a door and you take an immediate hit regardless of your reaction time. There's no way to respond to this aside from save scumming at higher difficulties to avoid taking significant damage. Spawn-in enemies in general are annoying as you can't rely on having covered previous areas. They're a lazy implementation from just having enemies in the area.\n\nDoom 3's shotgun is terrible. Its range is not good, with the spread being extremely wide. Just a few steps away from an imp is enough for many pellets to not hit. You need to be in point-blank (melee) range to one-shot an imp or zombie. That's really only viable by luring them around a corner, and even then point-blank range is risky because all the pellets may not hit. I can understand the design point that a Doom 1/2 shotgun in Doom 3's levels would be heavily overpowered. But the current game's balance makes the shotgun underpowered. This makes the core 3 weapons the Machine Gun, Chaingun, and Plasma Rifle: they all serve similar purposes, so there isn't much weapon variety. Grenade and Rocket Launcher are also available, but don't serve many purposes since most encounters have only a few enemies.\n\nLevel design has mixed quality. On one side, the assets and overall environments are varied and intuitive to navigate. On the other hand, enemy placement is bonkers with both enemy spawn points and monster closets that follow video game logic.\n\nAtmosphere-wise, I find the horror elements closer to F.E.A.R. and Resident Evil in that the game is more shooter and action than horror. There are many jumpscares, mostly in the form of ambushes, and none really caught me by surprise in terms of actual horror. It felt closer to Doom-style ambushing, although they could be cheap. Dead Space is perhaps a better example of using the horrific atmosphere and bizarre enemies to make something actually scary.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Released in 1994, Doom 3 came out at a time with games like Half-Life 2, World of Warcraft, Killzone, Metal Gear Solid 3, and F.E.A.R. Compared to those games, the 3D models are more detailed and lighting is more pronounced. The graphical fidelity is generally beyond them, with Doom 3 almost feeling like a tech demo. The weapon sounds feel extremely muted however, making you feel like you're wielding pea shooters. The soundtrack could also be better, c.f., Dead Space's.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ You can sometimes evade projectiles by crouching. I love the feeling when it works.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ The original flashlight weapon slot vs BFG Edition's armor-mounted flashlight. Playing the BFG Edition, it's clear certain areas were designed with a flashlight in mind such as two escort areas with the escort as the light source. Further, there's the feeling of seeing an enemy while you're unprepared with the flashlight in hand and must scramble to swap. However, many areas are also just too dark. So both approaches are flawed, but I do prefer the flashlight approach which is essential for the horror in preserving the original lighting. As an approach, I tried to avoid flashlight use whenever I was fighting an enemy. I wish they nerfed the BFG Edition's flashlight to encourage this, e.g., slower recharge.\n+ Computer interfaces are actual interfaces you navigate with a mouse. This is unlike typical interaction in video games by pressing an Interact button.\n+ Audio logs. They distract from the sound design as you navigate and are cautious for enemies. I also wish they auto-played when you pick them up. I'd rather not go into my PDA every time I pick one up.\n+ There's both an auto and manual save system. BFG Edition added the auto save, and I find the areas with auto save to be too sparse, so the game relies mostly on manual saving like the original Doom games. You control the level of savescumming.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ The berserk power-up is so out of place in the horror game. And the sound effect feels silly. I don't feel powerful with my restricted punch animations and muffled sound; the rate of fire and punch speed is also too damn slow.\n+ No native borderless. Alt-Enter for windowed mode and Borderless Gaming works though.\n+ A somewhat lengthy splash screen.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [doomwiki, including weapon stats](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Pistol_(Doom_3))\n+ [All DOOM 3 & Expansion Codes](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=295656505)\n\nThis entry does not include the expansion packs.

    "comments": "Brutal Doom is truly Doom with brutality amped up. The visual and sound enhancements attest to this as well as gameplay improvements that make shooting and level navigation more intense. It adds its own opinion of what modern Doom means: for example, reloading, grenades, and more weapons including a submachine gun that makes better use of all weapon slots. I admire Brutal Doom's interpretation as a successful approach that's different from Doom (2016)'s. I find a lot of the features unnecessary fluff though, and it's a common flaw among mods which tend to add more surface features rather than sticking with a base and improving the core gameplay.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Aside from overhauling the damage system and AI aggressivity, Brutal Doom also adds new weapons, abilities, and a few enemies. It adds arguably too many weapons, but they fit into just the 8 weapon slots, each filling as a subtype of a Doom weapon role which works well. The Submachine Gun replaces the pistol, which is excellent. Abilities include Alt Fire (e.g., iron sights), Kick, Combat Roll, Flash light, Quick Throw Frag Grenade, Reload, Offend.\n\nBrutal Doom doesn't change anything regarding level design, which is WAD-specific. It plays especially well with the official WADs, e.g., Doom 1. It may actually specifically place new enemies, friendly marines, etc. for the official WADs though it's hard to tell as they don't document this.\n\nBrutal Doom is often mentioned for its difficulty. But I don't find it anymore difficult than the original game at Ultra-Violence difficulty: it's just a different experience, where you have to play slightly more cautiously given that enemies are more aggressive and you reload and both you and enemies can kill faster. Brutal Doom in fact makes ammo management easier as pistol ammo is now viable as a main weapon rather than a last resort, and the Assault Rifle is more ammo-efficient than the Chaingun with rifle ammo being distinct from pistol ammo.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ It's even bloodier than the original Doom and I like it with its intensity: blood spatter, multilated corpses, lighting, and dramatic explosions. Color of health and armor pickups are emphasized, making it easier to spot. HUD is dynamic with blood splatter when killing enemies up close, bulletholes on screen when you get hit, etc; and it includes an enemy healthbar. It's also complemented well by the recommended sound additions. Andrew Hulshult's IDFKA soundtrack is excellent, capturing the essence of Doom (1993)'s soundtrack but removing its MIDI restrictions. Similarly, the sound effects make the weapons feel raw and powerful.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Old guns no longer become obselete as you acquire new ones.\n+ Enemy damage no longer has RNG.\n+ Killing an enemy at near death drops a health bonus.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Spectre is now completley invisible when not attacking. The difficulty ramp is good, and if you know they're there, you can spot them somewhat from their glowing eyes.\n+ I find a lot of the abilities to be unnecessary features: Kick, Combat Roll, Stealth Takedown, Grenade. Maybe they see usage in non-base game WADs.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Multiple weapons per weapon keybind. I think it's silly to have multiple types that you swap to. Would rather just have one of each. Smells of classic mod feature creep.\n+ The dynamic ADS mode in v21, enabling both toggle and hold-to-fire for. Players usually only do one mode, and the game can often accidentally interpret the other when you're doing various actions (e.g., quickscope). So I use [Brutal Doom with ADS mode.](https://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom/addons/adsmode)\n+ Friendly marines as companions. They're useless. My only enjoyment is seeing their death animation.\n+ [You have to go into console to bind directly to a stacked weapon slot.](https://www.reddit.com/r/brutaldoom/comments/fav5iu/is_there_a_way_to_bind_directly_to_a_stacked) I dislike that there's any notion of memory in the weapon keybinds. For example, you always have to hit 1 several times in order to specifically get the Chainsaw out. It would be good to at least have the switched weapon to be the last one you equipped in that weapon slot rather than a fixed order.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nGiven its significant changes, I'm adding as a standalone entry in order to track and evaluate it standalone. I played Brutal Doom v21, using GZDoom v4.5.0, with Brutal Doom's recommended setup: [Perkristian's HD sound effects](https://www.doomworld.com/vb/wads-mods/58879-the-hi-res-doom-sound-pack-is-updated) and [the IDKFA soundtrack](https://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom/addons/idkfa-doom-soundtrack); and using ZDL to be able to launch Brutal Doom under an executable, to be tracked on Steam as Ultimate Doom ([renamed to `rerelease/doom.exe` given the 2020 Unity port replacing the dosbox port](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2280/discussions/0/3004430047200250657)). I played on Ultra Violence, and with Normal (Rifle Start) which is the way it was meant to be played. Mouse sensitivity to roughly 8.5in/180 (800 DPI, 0.6 GZDoom sensitivity), mouse smoothing off, freelook, auto aim off, dot crosshair, weapons 678 mapped to ZXC. I played all episodes of Doom (1993), i.e., not the fourth. I gave up on E4M3 after savescumming on E4M1 and turning on iddqd on E4M2. I could get through E4, but not without tedious trial-and-error and watching walkthroughs. It just doesn't feel like the previous Doom episodes with its huge enemy count and map layout, being closer to Doom II. Graphics settings following videos posted on r/brutaldoom.",

    "date_finished": "2/17/21",
    "comments": "As part of the holy trinity of Build Engine classic FPS games alongside Blood and Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior defines its own identity with its Chinese setting (viewed from the lens of an American). This influences its weapons, enemies, and levels, and I enjoyed all these elements.\n\nShadow Warrior has two core flaws. First, peeking from corners and AOE damage are particularly critical due to the high enemy count, hitscan, enemies having precise aim, and no enemy stagger. It's fun but these reasons require you to savescum to enjoy the game. Second, level navigation can be unintuitive at times.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The game plays like Doom and does it well: level design, core controls, enemies and weapons, health system, etc. The weapons are unique: the katana and shurikens make me feel like Genji from Overwatch (although the shuriken is massively underpowered, treated like a pistol; and you rarely use the Katana in mid-to-endgame). The mainstay weapons are effectively Doom's: Riot Gun for short range, Uzi for medium range, Rocket Launcher and Grenade Launcher for AOE and suicide bombers. Other weapons have more limited ammo and are used situationally as novelty weapons: Nuke, Rail Gun, Guardian Head, Ripper Heart.\n\nInnovation-wise, Shadow Warrior is the first to have its melee weapon deal significant damage which I greatly enjoy. The feeling of peeking in a corner, luring an enemy, then one-shotting it with your blade, is excellent. It's also the first to feature akimbo weapons as a regular weapon and mannable vehicles.\n\nLike other Build Engine games, Shadow Warrior's level design is fairly realistic, with intuitively placed assets unlike earlier games like Doom and Heretic. However, levels feature many enemies, and it's punishing at high difficulties if you don't spam the Grenade Launcher and savescum. Unlike Blood which also has many hitscan enemies like Cultists, you can't crouch to throw off their aim, strafe faster than they can turn, stunlock them with their stagger, or get them to follow you (Shadow Warrior's pathing AI is much stupider, making this unreliable). This is the same problem with Duke Nukem 3D.\n\nShadow Warrior also features an item inventory. I dislike item inventories because it requires maintainence and serves a secondary role, never with a core purpose aside from Portable Medkit. So you would always just keep the items and never use them---which is even more involved management than BFG ammo.\n\nSome progression in levels is unintuitive. So I had to reference a walkthrough once every other level. For example, Map 7's bronze key on an alcove that requires driving a boat and jumping on top of it.; Map 8's ladder hidden behind a fireplace; Map 11's end of level trap and where to go next; Map 19's blue key card by opening a piston.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Excellent pixel graphics that age well. The complexity in the level's assets, diverse environments, and verticality make it one of the better-looking retro shooters.\n\nThe Asian racial humor is cringeworthy and offensive, arguably worse than Duke Nukem 3D's sexism, mixing Chinese and Japanese stereotypes into a Chinese man. Like Duke Nukem 3D, it's easy to play into stereotypes for cheap humor when you're not the one being made fun of, and where playing into those stereotypes just further worsens their representation. The developers would likely be less comfortable if the game they're developing were about pudgy middle-aged virgins who can't make friends, get made fun of for playing video games, and get cucked from their crushes.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Unlike most other games (e.g., Doom II, Duke Nukem 3D), and with exceptions like Blood, ammo management is not a problem.\n+ Sticky mines. They're never used in single player, like Duke Nukem 3D's Laser Trip Wire.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Given the massive amount of enemies and hitscan, the spamming the Grenade Launcher from a corner is OP. Its splash radius is so large that it often hits you though, making it easy to kill yourself.\n+ The Uzi Gun is quite a bit more overpowered than other weapons, including even the Riot Gun at short range sometimes. This is because it puts enemies at infinite stagger effectively as you continue to shoot them. A Riot Gun does not because of its semi-auto fire rate.\n+ Alternate firing. None of them are really helpful, with the exception of two: Riot Gun's auto fire, especially helpful for burst damage on a heavy single target; and Missile Launcher's nuke. Otherwise it's fairly needless complexity.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Mouse aiming. It has a weird stick where the crosshairs don't move if you try to move your mouse a small distance in order to finetune your shot. This is caused by mouse smoothing and/or mouse acceleration, which is a problem with all Build engine games ([1](https://steamcommunity.com/app/225160/discussions/0/846958724736561342), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/hf54sz/ive_discovered_that_build_engine_shooters_duke)). For Shadow Warrior, I found auto-aim crucial as enemies like Ghosts, Rippers, and Hornets move too quickly, with small hitboxes and erratic movement; it's hard to hit them without the precise aiming. You can set the horizontal and vertical sensitivity, where I set it to 1/6/1 for sensitivity, horizontal scale, and vertical scale (this is roughly 8.5in/180 degree turn); for some reason, going to the mouse settings rounds some values down, so I always have to manually set these values again if I ever go back to the mouse settings. It doesn't solve the mouse smoothing problems however.\n+ Trap mines are invisible. You can only detect them by their sound, for which proximity sound isn't setup well here and the sound itself is grating to hear throughout an entire level. You can't even shoot them. This is one of the many mechanics encouraging savescumming or otherwise memorizing enemy placement.\n+ Ninjas hiding behind cover to pop-in-and-shoot. It's a nice idea, but impossible to directly shoot, encouraging more Grenade Launcher spam instead; further, there's too much RNG in whether you can even hit them. This is one of the many mechanics encouraging savescumming or otherwise memorizing enemy placement.\n+ Certain guns require reloading, but a manual reload was not invented at the time.\n+ Railgun's aim is actually to the left of the crosshair.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n[Walkthrough from 3DRealms](https://legacy.3drealms.com/sw/walkthroughs.html)\n\nThis entry does not include the expansion packs. I played the Shadow Warrior Classic Redux (2013) edition. I played on Who Wants Wang (second highest difficulty) as it's presumably the equivalent of Doom's Ultra-Violence. Like other games, I rebinded 6-0 to QGZXC.",

    "comments": "Duke Nukem 3D shines in its unique setting, with a history of its own character, weapons, and enemies. However, I hate the unintuitive level progress, limited ammo, hitscan enemies, and lack of enemy stagger. I frequently got stuck in the game, at least once or twice every level, hampering the game's momentum. This happened most in Duke Nukem 3D of all classic FPS games I've experienced as of this writing, largely attributed to its more complicated level navigation with mazes, arbitrary buttons, and underwater tunnels.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Gameplay is effectively Doom: key emphasis on movement, weapon variety strong, keycard open level progression, health and armor system, and diverse enemy types. New to this game, there's actual vertical aiming. I also liked the weapon variety: with the core Doom weapons of Pistol, Shotgun, Chaingun Cannon, RPG, and Devastator (BFG-equivalent); but also Pipe Bomb and Shrinker. I used all the weapons excluding the Laser Tripbomb and Freezethrower.\n\n[Unfortunately, the level design is not intuitive, and I'm not the only one who experienced this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/ddviih/playing_duke_nukem_3d_for_the_first_time) This greatly impacted my overally enjoyment of the game as I frequently had to stop to refer to a walkthrough. With that said, the levels have a sense of realism with how things are placed that previous games like Doom and Heretic felt far too artificial.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ I love the graphics. It's like the perfected rendition of the 2.5D era that Doom (1993) made iconic. The textures and colors give it a sense of refined age. The misogynism doesn't age super well with scantily clad women and tossing at them cash. I think it's okay to the extent it promotes pornography not unlike how Doom promotes violence.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Destructible environments, like Blood a year later.\n+ Duke's various quips as you interact, like Blood a year later.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ With 20th Anniversary Edition World Tour, the vertical sensitivity is noticeably lower than horizontal, and you can't set them separately. It also has weird mouse smoothing---a problem with all Build Engine games (see my comments for Shadow Warrior). This incentivizes auto-aiming, but it's often too aggressive such as rockets aimed at an enemy far away but flies to a closer enemy. In Duke Nukem 3D, you particularly need it off in order to shoot the Battlelord Sentry's feet with your Shrinker.\n+ I hate how arbitrary the location of keycards are, obscured by some wall you have to interact with occasionally. This slows down gameplay as I have to look around for it or look it up.\n+ Hitscan enemies. In Blood this was tolerable as there are quite a few strategies to fight them, e.g., crouch or stagger. Most enemies do not stagger here. Fortunately, the Shrinker works on the Battlelord Sentry and Assault Commander, making their encounters tolerable if you have the ammo.\n+ Fuck the Sentry Drones. They're too spongey for their melee suicidal nature. Especially the worst in Episode 2. They're the Lost Souls equivalent from Doom, but spongier and their explosion with multiple of them means a one-shot death.\n+ Laser Trip Bomb has limited use.\n+ Certain guns require reloading, but a manual reload was not invented at the time.\n+ Death system is forgiving with the Playback Feature, allowing you to revive at any time you were in the level. Helps avoid accidental quicksaves that are poorly timed. However, I run into a [bug where I randomly die](https://steamcommunity.com/app/434050/discussions/0/143388408893795534) so I just turn it off.\n+ No real quicksave system. F6 is a shortcut to the save menu and F9 is a shortcut to the load menu. Fortunately, it's not that bad: two keypresses instead of 1.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI played the Duke Nukem 3D 20th Anniversary Edition World Tour (2016) edition. It's apparently better than the Megaton edition (2013) as well as the fan source port of the original EDuke32. I played on Come Get Some!, the hard mode (Ultra Violence) equivalent of Doom. This entry only includes the 3 base episodes and not the 4th from Atomic Edition (1996) and the 5th from 20th Anniversary Edition World Tour (2016).",

    "comments": "Every year you can see the increased polish in graphics, presentation, and minor tweaks to the Call of Duty titles. Modern Warfare does nothing truly new, but I did enjoy the single-player campaign when treated like a typical blockbuster action movie. MW (2019) pushes even further on military realism---gritty settings, more cautious and determined shooting---and I find it accomplished this for the better to stamp out CoD's identity. The multiplayer is less impressive, bordering mediocrity in sticking to the formula but with Modern Warfare weapons/maps.\n\n__Story.__ The single-player campaign has all the merits and flaws of a typical blockbuster war movie: excellent polish, a tad of grit with attention to certain realistic military tactics but not enough to make it accurate, Hollywood diversity, streamlined pacing, no real delving into the true darkness and controversies instead aiming to paint things black-and-white, and with white macho men as leads. No Americans are doing the pillaging or torture. There are also diverse settings, with cities being hit and civilians and child soldiers abound. I love its further push toward military realism. I also like that it's a reimagining of the Modern Warfare series so you can play it without having played all three other titles.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Single player plays like a typical linear FPS with cutscenes, cinematic set pieces, and scripted combat scenarios. It remains the same as previous titles with twitch shooting, playing as just a soldier among a group, refillable health incentivizing cover shooting, checkpoints, and a console-friendly weapon inventory. The mix of different gameplay across the campaign keeps it fresh, acting like the streamlined FPS that CoD is known for: light stealth, planting explosings, assaulting a base, retreating, sniping, etc. I found playing the campaign to feel even more like a military shooter, which is for the better. CoD leans further into its realism where you're even more incentivized than previous games to be cautious as you move outside of cover and closer in distance: movement speed is lowered, you can die instantaneously, there are audio enemy callouts, your crosshair aim decreases as you move. This is pretty cool for the realism. I also love the more immersive HUD in the campaign; in multiplayer it remains fairly cluttered and arcade-y. AI remains bad though.\n\nMultiplayer hasn't really changed since the original COD4. The campaign is clearly a step up and the multiplayer is the same-old. There's more maps, game modes, and customization options. Nothing really changed in the core gameplay. Perhaps most significant is that spawn camping is less possible with smarter spawn positions. Skill-based matchmaking would make matches more balanced and apparently it has it. Without a specific rating, the game remains clearly casual and without specific modes that really feel competitive to encourage teamwork like Overwatch. I like the minor quality of life things (not necessarily new in this title): now typical in modern FPS games, you can mantle, slide, and peek from a corner. I also like that you can reload while staying on iron sights. You can hear footsteps to avoid ambushes if they sprint behind you. There are both lethal and tactical grenades.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The graphics are photorealistic, particularly the cutscenes. It's the most detail I've seen for facial models, textures, and lighting in a video game. I can't wait until this is the minimum standard for all video games, indie ones included.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ In multiplayer mode, the default gameplay mode is Quick Play. This incentivizes diversity in game modes, and not shoehorning the majority population to Team Deathmatch like typical FPS games.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Reloading a checkpoint (e.g., failing) takes a long time with a black screen, sometimes disconnecting you from the game. [This is incredibly annoying.](https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/junuu5/campaign_close_to_being_unplayable_because_when_i)\n+ You have to be connected to their server in order to play single player. I abhor this business model.\n+ There are still hard restrictions that cause failure in a campaign mission. For example, shooting at civilians.\n+ Games can start with as few as four people.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Performance settings](https://www.gamingscan.com/best-settings-for-call-of-duty-modern-warfare)\n\nI played both the single player campaign (veteran, which is second highest difficulty; it's the same as realism but just with the standard HUD) and multiplayer modes. Veteran works well as a realism setting, with near instantaneous NPC reactions and aim. It can be grating at times as a video game. In order to progress you effectively just remember spawn points and optimal positioning, which puts you out of the moment. No one really kills that many people.",

Heretic plays just as well but with no innovations on top of Doom. The game gets fairly repetitive in not really adding much after each episode. So Iâm glad Heretic's base game is only 3 episodes; I wish the original Doom were also that short.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Heretic plays almost like a reskin of Doom, with slight modifications to Doom's weapon arsenal, different enemies, and a fantasy setting for the levels. Like Doom, it plays very well. The projectile non-hitscan enemies, weapons, enemies, and level navigation are all solid. It even has the same details such as enemy stagger, monster infighting, artificially constructed levels with little realism.\n\nThe item inventory is new. I found this added needless complexity from just activating the item as a power-up immediately.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Zero hitscan enemies. Makes for fun combat as you run around and dodge.\n+ Unlike Doom, the highest difficulty does not include respawning enemies.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Like Doom, bosses reappear as enemies in future levels. I think this works well for the Iron Lich as they can still be downed with a few Rocket Launcher shots. But Minotaurs are too heavy of health sponges, especially when they appear at early levels like E4M1 and E5M1.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The engine is the same as Doom so the control and graphics limitations remain the same. Heretic chooses a more colorful palette. Its environmental interaction with streaming rivers that push against your movement, or blowing winds, was new at the time.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI initially tried on the Chocolate Doom source port, but I dislike the lack of free look (vertical mouse movement), no autoaim, crosshair, widescreen support (it's pillarboxed), and borderless (it's only fullscreen or windowed). These are technically not vanilla, but people already do WASD + mouselook + always run, and always run is arguably vanilla. I stuck with GZDoom which is another popular alternative. Weirdly GZDoom adds jump and crouch, which [the original Doom and Heretic do not have](https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Jumping); so I disabled them as they can have some impact on intended level design (e.g., to get across an area or jump a ramp with item pickups). I also set up GZDoom to [play under Steam in order to track playtime](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1730383333). I played on \"Thou art a smite-meister\" difficulty, Heretic's equivalent of Doom's Ultra-Violence. I found the game surprisingly forgiving in how much damage an enemy would do to you, and how much health and ammo pickups there are.\n\nThis entry does not include the expansion (Shadow of the Serpent Riders). Originally motivated to play as one of the most iconic Doomlikes of the time, next to Wolfenstein 3D, Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, and Blood. I'm also motivated as it's the spiritual predecessor to Amid Evil (2019) by New Blood Interactive, which is one of my favorite indie studios as they bring back the highlights of the classic FPS genre.",

    "comments": "Blood reigns as one of the most stellar classic FPS games. It perfectly captures cultish atmosphere and setting, unique weaponry, enemies, some of the best level designs of all time (e.g., train level, carnival level), core controls, and a well-designed difficulty. Released in 1997, Blood is at the pinnacle of the classic FPS with controls such as freelook, jump, and crouch, prior to the trend in following Quake (1996). The difficulty isn't always fair, but playing Blood puts you in the perfect rhythm when it is.\n\nBlood's flaws are: inverted difficulty curve and the occasionally confusing level progression (albeit less in Blood of all retro shooters).\n\n__Story.__ The protagonist isn't silent, with a forboding narration adding to the game. The environments define a unique cult hurror. Blood defines atmosphere in a way no other shooter of its generation does.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Core Doom-like gameplay but with unique weaponry, enemies, and gothic level design. Weapon-wise, the most memorable are the Dynamite Bundle, a core weapon for splash damage rather than a side weapon like most other titles (or resembling a grenade launcher), as well as the Sawed-Off Shotgun. Other weapons are also unique: for example, Pitchfork, Aersol Can. Like other games at the time, there's both a primary and secondary fire. I try to use all guns so as to not waste ammo. But my mainstay weapons are: Dynamite Bundle for AOE, Sawed-off Shotgun for short range, Tommy Gun for medium range, Napalm Launcher and Tesla Cannon for single target DPS; and the others situationally.\n\nThe game oozes atmosphere, and the levels are among the best of the genre with realism and enemy placement. I greatly prefer the natural placement of buildings and doors, making for intuitive navigation, than the artificial placement of assets in Doom/Heretic levels. Maybe it was the difficulty I was playing, but I greatly enjoyed not having to micromanage my ammo outside of the first one or two levels in an episode.\n\nThe game is notoriously difficult. Normal difficulty is the equivalent of Doom (1993)'s Ultra-Violence. Weirdly, the difficulty curve is inverted with the first level being the hardest, where health pickups and ammo are always limited, and you find yourself using the Pitchfork often. For newcomers, learning how to use the Dynamite Bundle and fight hitscan enemies are the hurdle. Hitscan enemies are particularly difficult, encouraging a cautious, corner-peeking playstyle. I enjoyed the mechanics to defeat them: crouch to throw off their aim (which is a nice mechanic as crouch is often just for navigation in these games); strafe, which is faster than they can turn; stunlock them using the Tommy Gun to infinitely stagger; or have them follow you around a corner. I found myself savescumming less in this game (although I still did, due to occasionally ridiculous enemy placement or ambush).\n\nLike other Doom/Quake games, the sandbox levels can lead to sometimes confusingly oriented navigation. I ran into this the least in Blood compared to others, but still found several unintuitive in Episode 3 (e.g., hitting the vertical lever, or the arbitrary permutation to unlock the 3-lighted door, in E3M6).\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Great art style to define the cultish horror. Animations for weapons and general sound effects like enemies dying are solid. Caleb's maniacal laugh. I especially love hearing it when you interact with various things or blow up a bunch of enemies with your dynamite. Destructible environments. Or seeing enemies burn. The pre-rendered 3D models in the cutscenes age poorly. Music is serviceable but not memorable.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ No mouse smoothing. Unlike other Build Engine remakes (namely, Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior's), Blood: Fresh Supply has an option to turn it off. I find this essential for precise aim, where slight movements to your mouse otherwise translate to no crosshair movement.\n+ Powerup is akimbo guns. Must be one of the earliest adoptions in a video game.\n+ Innocent NPCs in the levels.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ The item inventory with, e.g., Doctor's Bag. I found managing the item inventory needless and prefer classic FPS games without one.\n+ There are three types of armor, each providing resistance to different enemy damage. I found this unnecessarily complicated.\n+ The Aersol Can's unique design and mechanics are great. However, it's not very viable, with the best role as short range AOE but is worse than the Sawed-Off Shotgun which also benefits from stagger. I only really use it for AOEing down the rodents.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Cheat codes](https://www.blood-wiki.org/index.php/Cheat_Codes)\n+ [Steam basic guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1737338388)\n\nThis entry does not include the expansion packs. I played the Blood: Fresh Supply (2019) edition. I played on normal (Lightly Broiled). Blood has a notorious difficulty over other classic FPS, and with quite a few hitscan enemies that encourage peeking. I found myself playing conservatively with movement and ammo, and savescumming, which was not enjoyable. Fortunately, this was only a major problem in the first two levels where you're not well-equipped in either weapons, ammo, or armor. Like other classic FPS, I rebinded 6-0. 6 is Grenade (G) and QR have defaults of navigating item inventory; so for 7-0, I did ZXCV.",

    "comments": "Portal 2 is truly an enhanced version of Portal 1, with more level variety including environments beyond synthetic testing facilities, characters, jokes, and cinematic set pieces to add to the story.\n\n__Story.__ The story acts like the first game but adds much more lore midway into the game. Portal 2 also pushes further on the cheeky robotic character, here with Wheatley. GlaDOS is no longer just an evil mastermind, with more of a personality that also acts as your ally at times.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Core portaling is the same. Portal 2 adds new areas that go beyond the typical test facility, as well as new ideas such as the gels: Repulsion, Propulsion, Conversion, and Cleansing; and excursion tunnels. The story makes it possible to add constant throwbacks, including how to fight Wheatly as a final boss compared to GlaDOS.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Graphics are astounding for 2011. The combination of realism and some cartoon textures is classic Valve.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Movement speed is low, even lower than in Portal 1.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Quite a few puzzles are about shooting at an obscure location.\n+ Weapon swap is actually faster than the swap animation. I like that this means you can swap and fire instantly, making swapping viable in the combat pace.

    "comments": "Dusk is effectively the pinnacle of the classic FPS subgenre, taking all the elements that make it shine: health and armor system, movement speed, weapons without reloading, enemies, simple core controls, sandbox level design, quicksave system. The controls and animation work really well to make the player feel alive. Dusk also introduces a few new minor elements. Ultimately, I like that it's a different interpreation from Doom (2016) on the best of classic FPS, here closer to a highlight reel rather than creating the glorykill system for even more aggressive play.\n\nMy only nit is that like Doom and Quake (especially Doom 2), Dusk has limited ammo in a number of levels, often requiring too much ammo management across all your weapons. I find this tedious, distracting from the more frenetic gameplay of dooming. Higher difficulties also make you too squishy easy to go 100-0, making the game play more like a bullet hell than Doom.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The inheritance of the classic FPS (\"boomer shooter\") elements is excellent. Morale reduces health damage taken by 50%, taking the form of armor. The invisible enemy Wendigo as a rendition of Doom's Spectre is excellent: it combines the combat with horror having made me jump a few times as it's introduced in dark areas and creepy music. The weapons are all core Doom weapons, and all with a purpose. I also love the new aspects: dual-wielding; crouching also slides. The boss fights are spontaneous, well-paced, and generally excellent. I also prefer Dusk's approach to a sword than Doom Eternal, where it's a core weapon for melee (albeit still awkward to use) incentivized by certain enemies, rather than a one-use single-target BFG-type.\n\nDusk's level design is excellent, combining standard key/locked area and sandbox levels with horror elements from its atmosphere. It's also fairly experimental in certain levels, encouraging certain weapons in areas when you pick up a weapon and there's a sudden spawn of enemies perfect for that weapon; or the sword and crossbow-only level of E3M1.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The aesthetic follows Quake and PlayStation 1 game pixellation, which fits its era. Weapon animations is especially fluid. Andrew Hushults' music works very well.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Intruder mode, which starts every level with just the sickles. Adds to replayability.\n+ No fall damage.\n+ Monster infighting.\n+ Doom and Quake-style secrets.\n+ The Blood-like horror elements with actual jumpscares.\n+ The animation controls for fun: flip weapon, cigar, holster.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ You can only block with your sword with >=50 morale and charge with >=100 health. This is easily a case of rich gets richer.\n+ Crystal of Madness. While I like the idea of forcing enemies to attack each other, it's a item you have to carry around, meaning it has marginal use.\n+ No native borderless support. Fortunately, windowed + Borderless Gaming works.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI played on Cero Miedo difficulty ([I Can Take it](https://dusk.gamepedia.com/Difficulty)) as apparently the game is most balanced for it ([episode 1 technically balanced for Cero Miedo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dusk_The_Game/comments/jnejig/how_am_i_supposed_to_play/gb15894), and the two higher difficulties in fact bring up a dialogue box asking for confirmation and stating that they are not intended for a first playthrough. Like Doom, I remapped weapons on keybinds 6-9 to Q, G, Z, and X.",

    "comments": "Quake 2 is a great title but only with arguable ties to Quake 1 as a sequel. Its origins of being developed as a standalone title are clear with its realism-based changes, and different set of enemies and weapons. While I liked some of these changes, they aren't always for the better.\n\n__Story.__ There's more of a story here, with cinematic cutscenes between levels. You also come across non-enemy NPCs who are your allied marines stranded on a strange land. It's still fairly minimal though. The \"stranded in an unknown alien land\" setting is different from Quake 1's fantasy setting. I find neither necessarily executed better (they're both bad).\n\n__Gameplay.__ Same core gameplay as Quake 1 with gunplay, controls, and level navigation, with keys you must pick up to unlock new areas. As Quake 2 was originally developed as not a Quake sequel, the weapon set has some but not much overlap with Quake 1; and the enemies are entirely different.\n\nLevels are designed more realistically, and I actually enjoyed the level designs here as they seemed more intuitive to navigate. Each level now has explicit primary and secondary objectives which I find unnecessary (I hardly want to waste time occasionally pressing F1 to refer back to the mission objectives HUD). Also unnecessary is the new item inventory, even carrying around power-ups rather them being immediately applied on pickup. This encourages needless management similar to BFG ammo.\n\nThe overall level design is pretty streamlined and easy to follow. I did however have to resort to a walkthrough in a few select parts of a level though. The Palace level especially requires lots of backtracking.\n\nLike other Doom/Quake titles, certain weapons use the same ammo and strictly dominate earlier weapons you get. This gives a sense of artificial weapon variety where I greatly prefer encouraging all weapons to be used. After accumulating all weapons, I used Super Shotgun (shells), Chain Gun (bullets), Grenade Launcher (grenades), Rocket Launcher (rockets), Hyper Blaster (cells), Rail Gun (slugs), and BFG 10K which I rebinded as 1-7.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Like Quake, Quake 2 features significant graphical improvements. There are now skyboxes and colored lighting effects. Levels are less blocky with higher polycount and smoother interpolation. Death animations feel more lively, including with heads removed clean and enemies crawling on the ground as they die.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ I don't recall if this was also in Quake 1, but in Quake 2, you can pick up health packs even when at full health. Going over the limit slowly goes down to the max of 100. I greatly prefer this approach as it discourages frugal usage of health packs where you go back and forth to maximize their usage.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ For the first time in Doom/Quake titles, some weapons like the Machine Gun feature recoil. Fortunately, the Machine Gun is quickly outpaced by the Chain Gun.\n+ You have to swap explicitly to a flare gun in order to lighten an area. I prefer the more streamlined approach from Unreal and Half-Life which includes a standalone flashlight item. Grenades are similarly unwieldy.\n+ Weapon swap speed is slower than in previous titles. This makes the iconic weapon swapping to optimize ammo and weapon usage depending on the enemy and positioning more difficult.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nThis entry does not include the two expansion packs and only evaluates the single player campaign. I played the Quake II RTX version to enable modern settings: widescreen resolution, borderless (via windowed + Borderless Gaming), and WASD+mouselook+always run controls. I would otherwise have to use a third-party engine like Quakespasm. I followed a [guide to include Quake 2's OST](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1894966970); like Quake 1, the original Quake 2 requires a CD. I turned RTX off, playing with the OpenGL renderer as the RTX renderer gave me 10 FPS at 2560x1440p with my 1080 Ti. Like Quake 1, I played on Medium difficulty.",

    "comments": "Unreal was released at a unique point in FPS history, as one of the final titles in the Doom-Quake trend and overshadowed by the cinematic linear FPS trend started by Half-Life on the same year. Evaluated standalone, Unreal stands out in its atmosphere, iconic weaponry, graphics, enemy AI, and strong core Doom/Quake gameplay with movement, level design, and enemy variety. Gone are the artificially designed corridor shooter and arcade elements of Doom/Quake, and in are atmosphere and a mix of indoor corridor and outdoor environments. Unreal's weakest part is its occasionally confusing level designs with convoluted solutions that can hamper the game's momentum. This happened too often at every level or every other level which lowered my overall enjoyment as I had to reference a walkthrough.\n\n__Story.__ Effectively Doom and Quake-level of storytelling, which is bare none. However, you do pick up a lot of lore as you explore the world and examine assets with the Universal Translator. Particularly notable in the world is the mix of both indoor corridor shooter like Quake and outdoor settings.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Overall gunplay is like Quake and Doom, and with navigation and a focus on only a handful of enemies to fight as a trendsetter before Half-Life. Its level design is cinematic with realism: the areas are atmospheric and more realistic than the synthetic creations that you'd often see in Doom levels. You even navigate areas in levels devoid of many enemies, and where enemies you do fight are often single in number. I find the raw gunplay very fun with a diverse weapon variety, enemy variety, projectile/hitscan, and ammo management. Enemy AI is surprisingly intelligent, particularly in dodging your projectile attacks. Also notable are the shaman aliens who if protected can open you secret areas for extra items.\n\nIt may have been the Medium difficulty I played, but I found the game very forgiving in both health restores and ammo unlike Doom and Quake. As long as you cycle through your weapons with the most ammo, you never run out.\n\nI love the unique weaponry in Unreal. They vary in art style as well as projectile and hitscan variety. For example, Dispersion Pistol, Razor Jack, Bio Rifle. It does run into the typical issue with Doom/Quake titles in that although there's significant weapon variety, a few of the early weapons aren't ever used as you accumulate the more powerful weapons (e.g., Rifle > ASMD > Automag; Flak Cannon and Minigun > Stinger). By the midgame, I only used 5 weapons: Eightball, Flak Cannon, Razorjack, GES Biorifle, Rifle, and Minigun. Personally, it wasn't until Doom (2016) (and especially Doom Eternal) where the entire weapon variety was really used. You still do experience specific enemies encouraging you to use certain weapons in this game as well as Doom/Quake titles: e.g. based on range, Eightball's AOE splash damage, or ASMD's hitscan to avoid the enemies that dodge projectiles.\n\nLike Quake, the sandbox level design can get annoying when you get stuck in a level, losing all your momentum in enjoying the raw gameplay as you get lost wandering around a level trying to find the knob you didn't quite hit or the corner you missed. Some are particularly convoluted in Unreal. For example, wandering the water mazes in Chizra - Nali Water God; or the entrance unlock to Dark Arena; or navigating the vertical and horizontal maze of lifts in Sunspire; or the knob behind the bar in Na Pali Haven; or the right underwater tunnels to traverse in Bluff Eversmoking; the arbitrary slant you must go down in Dasa Mountain Pass. What makes this even more cumbersome is that controls like door unlocks can be relocked if you hit the control again; and some controls are timed. It would be so much simpler if hitting the control always kept it open. Unfortunately, Unreal was right before the revolution of linear level designs that Half-Life started.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ As one of the earliest 3D games, the game doesn't necessarily age well with blocky textures and empty space. With that said, the lighting and overall atmosphere is quite brilliant particularly with the Direct 3D 11 renderer. The music rocks. I also really like the beheading and enemy corpse explosion animations.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Universal translator. Gives you lore similar to System Shock as you navigate the world.\n+ Monster infighting like Doom.\n+ Quicksave/quickload hotkeys like Doom.\n+ This must be one of the earliest games where you play a female character, and the female character isn't sexualized.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Like Quake and unlike Doom, Unreal doesn't have a Use key, instead automatically using when close.\n+ No real secret areas like Doom and Quake.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Item inventory is a chore to navigate and keep track of. I would rather it not exist. I only really used the Universal Translator and Flare/Flashlight/Searchlight. Light sources also aren't reusable, so I tend to not use it. I prefer Half-Life's approach of a dedicated flashlight key.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Unreal Gold 4K Textures + DX11 [03.11.2020]](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2276457084)\n\n+ [Unreal weapon guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=873237746)\n+ [Unreal wiki with level walkthrough](https://unreal.fandom.com/wiki/Unreal_Single_player)\n\nI played the Unreal Gold version on Steam (but this entry does not include the Return to Na Pali expansion), on Medium difficulty, and remapped some controls for modern settings (e.g., WASD). I played with the [OldUnreal 227i patch](https://www.oldunreal.com) to support modern Windows, extra renders, bug fixes, etc., and which is apparently endorsed by Epic themselves after official support ended; and with the [Unreal DirectX11 Renderer v1.6.1](https://www.moddb.com/mods/unreal-directx11-renderer-for-ut-ug-rune-and-dx) to play in high-resolution, widescreen, Direct3D 11, and beyond the 30 FPS cap. Borderless Gaming doesn't work to convert the windowed version to borderless, but turning the taskbar to auto-hide works fine enough: you still see the window title. The HUD is also too small, not scaled properly for the high resolution. I deliberately chose not to play with HD textures to experience the vanilla game.",

    "date_started": "1/23/21",
    "date_finished": "2/7/21",
    "comments": "Overwatch most innovates in defining RPG roles of tank, support, and DPS in a multiplayer FPS game; and with novel game modes of Capture Points, Assault, and Escort the Payload, going beyond the standard of typical deathmatch or search and destroy to incentivize teamwork and disincentivze twitch shooting. Overwatch requires mastery of map awareness, positioning, ability timing, and team coordination.\n\nLike all multiplayer games, what I can't stand most is the toxic culture. This is particularly an issue in competitive play. Further, the RNG of teamplay in solo queue can make games quite frustrating as the best you can do is washed out by the variance of the other 11 players you play with and against. I much prefer games determined only by your own play, so you know what you did well or poorly. The game's meta causes many steamrolls instead of close fights, which is not fun to be on the winning or losing side as you don't feel like you learned much from the game. It also has too much of an emphasis on DPS roles (partially caused by more than half the roster being DPS, and with DPS queues sometimes being even 20 minutes); and lacks further incentives for players to have selfish rewards to play as a team (e.g., overextending to kill people which is more fun than staying in position; no rewards for adapting to another hero when hard countered).\n\nOther issues:\n\n+ The significance of turtling due to 6v6 games, where a group can easily beat any single one or two. This makes teamwork so vital which is challenging in solo queue. It's a rollercoaster where you steamroll or get steamrolled, especially in lower ELOs due to staggering and less team tactics.\n+ Tanks define the meta. Not all tank comps are great, and many times you can lose because neither tank wants to go main tank. This worsens the solo queue experience for non-tanks even more.\n+ King of the Hill maps. Symmetrical maps and single area cluster fucks are not fun. I'm an Ana main and Ana is also terrible at these maps, so this means 5/21 maps I automatically don't enjoy playing.\n+ Visual clutter.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The tank, support and damage roles work very well, with team composition have a key importance (e.g., shields, flying characters/hitscan, flankers). Overwatch goes against the multiplayer FPS standard of twitch shooting and deathmatches, instead placing more emphasis on teamplay, positioning, game awareness, ult timing, prioritizing objectives. It works well with the MOBA approach of a select number of abilities that define each hero, and with no progression-based upgrades saved across games.\n\nI like all the highlights and encouragment of sportsmanship: endorse player (both giving and receiving), voting on players after a game (both giving and receiving), play of the game, no viewing of team stats which causes team trash talking, career profiles are private by default. Games are quick so if you're overwhelmingly losing there isn't much an incentive to leave like in Call of Duty. Leaving games reduces your endorsement level.\n\nDespite all the sportsmanship additions mentioned above, like any multiplayer gaming community, the culture is toxic---particularly in the competitive scene. Teams are sweaty, quick to blame, and overenthusiastic from a single game's outcome. Both chat and voice chat is toxic.\n\nDuring the season I played Overwatch, timing and proper execuion of ultimates had a significant sway on team battles: they one-shot enemies and often can lead to a double or triple kill. I dislike that it's so reliant on this and would rather ultimates be slightly nerfed to emphasize the rest of gameplay.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The cartoon, Team Fortress, and Warcraft-like art style ages well. Colors are excellent. THe sound design is top notch: you can really feel shots as well as enemy footsteps.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ All the incentives to encourage diversity of roles. Support and tanks are often rewarded with shorter queue times and a handful of credits. The Flex role enables priority passes.\n+ Minimum queue time is perfect to do a quick bathroom break.\n+ After each death, you see a short replay of how you died. It's a great way to keep the game's rhythm as you wait for your respawn timer.\n+ Like other competitive FPS games, you can customize your reticle.\n+ Skill Rating for each of the three roles is separate.\n+ You get notifications if someone got suspended later when you (and enough others) report them. Lets you know the system actually works.\n+ Game replays. Lets you save entire games and review it from multiple viewpoints.\n+ The custom games, although they're not nearly as various as Warcraft III or Starcraft custom games.\n+ Sound design. For example, you can hear footsteps, which is important gameplay to catch flanks. And ults like McCree which is important for dodging.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Lootbox approach to a huge amount of collectibles. At the least, you can use credits you gain ingame to buy specific skins you want.\n+ The conseuctive game XP bonus only applies for quick play, and if you let the game auto-queue. You can't skip the Play of the Game and commendation voting parts which ideally you'd like to wait again in the queue.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.overbuff.com | Includes average damage/healing stats per hero and league\n+ [ml7, top ana youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCejVlAl2kUwBgSHtQeBoKhQ)\n+ https://www.twitch.tv/sleepy\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchUniversity\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/AnaMains/comments/kpbfgn/ana_guides_and_resources\n+ [Surefour aiming tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YS3dPWf6Xw)\n+ [ana aim drills](https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchUniversity/comments/5icina/overwatch_ana_aim_tutorial_guide_8drills10m_tips)\n\nI was never interested in playing Overwatch when it first released. I disdain both multiplayer FPS (I can't get into Call of Duty, CSGO, Halo, etc.), and MOBAs, which this game combines both. However, watching Twitch streamers, some of who originated as Overwatch players makes me want to play the game to appreciate their origins: Moonmoon, Roflgator, Surefour, XQC, m0xy, and several people who play it casually (e.g., Sodapoppin, Vigors)---particularly when they all started to play together on Jan 21-22 2021 streams.\n\nSettings-wise, I followed eDPI similar to the most conventional pro setting: 3200 eDPI (800 DPI/4.0 sensitivity). There are [slight differences](https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchUniversity/comments/8fjdrq/whats_the_reasoning_behind_low_dpi_and_higher) with DPI vs sensitivity due to mouse sensors for sufficiently high DPI (it's a hardware vs software difference) but negligible for common ranges. Similarly for my reticle, I use a green dot. It doesn't matter much, but green helps with the contrast of red enemies, dot is the most important for targeting headshots, and crosshairs only make slight difference to help with lining up at the cost of minimalism where you can concentrate more on your target.\n\nI use default keybindings and with push-to-talk set to mouse-side button up. I use low settings for all FX, high settings for model and textures, and low music volume. I chose to play support (Ana main with primarily Baptiste as side) as I wanted to switch up my playstyle from other RPG-style games. Ana has the highest skill cap, and I like the emphasis on aiming, hybrid damage/healing, crowd control, and map positioning/situational awareness. Other support are useful when I need to play closer to my team (e.g., control maps, bad line of sight maps, flanks) or more aggressively. For tank, I play Roadhog or Reinhardt. For damage, I play McCree, Genji, Tracer. I'm not good at these heros, but I do like playing characters that force you to improve your fundamental aiming and are the most iconic and influential DPS. From my Overwatch profile as of 3/26/21, I played a total of 193 hours.",

Its art style and animations make it fun to experience just as a visual spectacle, adding further to its frenetic gameplay.\n\n__Story.__ It's like an extension of Hotline Miami: drugs, loneliness, feelings of loss and violence. The story is more coherent and tropey here, and my opinion is mixed on whether the added character development and setting was good. I do like the various choices as you interact with the story, even if many end up being an illusion of choice. The skippiness with time and various hallucinations adds a degree of surrealness that Hotline Miami doesn't.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Like hotline Miami but a 2D viewpoint. Controls are simple, deaths are instant, kills are gratifying, frequent checkpoints, even the sequence of levels followed by conversation interludes is the same. One benefit of this game are its bosses, which are each dynamic and unique in their moveset. Gameplay variety is a lot less though: from how to tackle a given area in eliminating everyone to the weapon and item variety (there is none). Having Fifteen as a playable character, with a new move, shows the potential in enabling more gameplay variety. I wish at least they would enable Fifteen as a playable character for the full game after you beat it once---similar to the other unlockable options like Speedrun and Hard Mode. A more ambitious goal would be more time-based abilities, pushing further than the current two of Slow and Dash.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ I like the mix of pixel art, neon colors, and synthwave soundtrack. It reminds me of Hotline Miami but with an even better soundtrack.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ It displays the soundtrack names as they play.\n+ The timing of interactions. You have to explicitly wait for the person to finish talking to move to the dialogue options. Otherwise you interrupt them and end the conversation.\n+ Although it was only for one level, you could play as Fifteen who not only has a Slow but also a Dash move.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ No native borderless support. Borderless Gaming doesn't work either, cropping much of the screen. At the least, you can go windowed and resize it.",

It also features great core combat, enemy variety, and plenty of dungeons and items. Flaw-wise, the rigidty of completing dungeon after dungeon is too repetitive. Unlike Ocarina of Time, there are no side quests or interesting deeper characters (supporting or otherwise). There's just too many dungeons, 11, each of which feature the same music and don't vary enough in diversity to validate the amount.\n\n__Story.__ LTTP introduces the idea of parallel worlds, further built on by, e.g., Ocarina of Time.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Core gameplay builds on prior titles, combining elements of overworld exploration, RPG progression, and dungeons. Camera-wise, LTTP did the correct choice of a 2D overhead perspective over Adventure of Link's sidescrolling perspective, and there are no camera issues or handling of multiple enemies such as with Ocarina of Time's lock-on and lack of manual camera control. Controls are minimal and tight: only a few moves and you can now walk diagonally and the sword has a larger swing. The 2D combat is excellent. Dungeons are more linear and combat-oriented than solving specific puzzles, and the combat difficulty is relatively quite high on par with its older titles.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The graphics are at the peak of 2D pixel sprite graphics, and with an iconic 16-bit soundtrack.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Unlike its successors, there's only one item shortcut, with the game designed such that you don't need to swap as often (though you still do).\n+ You accumulate arrows and bombs and no longer spend Rupee to use them.\n+ [No missable items.](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Permanently_Missable_Items)\n+ You get infinite restock of bombs and arrows with the Mysterious Hut in Kakariko Village.\n+ Like previous titles, LTTP's Master Sword has Sword Beam if you have full health. It's a little overpowered however and is like a rich-gets-richer scheme, helpful more for advanced players.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Fortune Teller hut. You pay rupees for ingame hints on what to do next. Usually, games give this out for free!\n+ The effectively infinite Rupee dump, at least for the duration of a playthrough, for upgrading to a maximum of 50 Bomb and 70 Arrow capacity.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ You can only save and exit. When you load a game, you start from Link's House or the Sanctuary.\n+ Secrets and puzzles are occasionally too cryptic in this game compared to its successors. For example, cracks in the wall that you must use a Bomb on for a Piece of Heart. A hidden tile to activate or move in order to open the door.\n+ Too many optional items that only have a single required use or are only used to assist in battle. I greatly enjoy Ocarina of Time's removal of all these items, overloading new items to serve both exploration/puzzles and combat.\n+ Compass only shows your location and the boss room. It doesn't show all hidden Treasure Chests like Ocarina of Time and beyond.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [overworld map](https://www.snesmaps.com/maps/ZeldaALinkToThePast/ZeldaALinkToThePastBG.html)\n+ [zeldadungeon.net](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/a-link-to-the-past-walkthrough)\n\nI played on an SNES emulator (Higan). I lost my save at Turtle Rock and skim-watched the rest of the playthrough on Youtube.

The biggest change in controls is the characters, with two of Diddy's agility from the first game which is a big quality-of-life improvement.

Controls are significantly improved from the PS1 games: movement and aim with an analog stick, a manual camera, lock on, left/right actually move the direction instead of just turn, you can stealth kill from multiple angles (e.g., a jump, from a ledge), and double jump greatly improves agility, one of the special move is parry (Ninjutsu Block). The grappling hook no longer clips through walls. The alert system is also significantly improved as there's a heartbeat that better signifies the possibility of being spotted prior to the alert going off.\n\nThe level design is also greatly improved. There is more variety in environments, including verticality, and more involved objectives than simply going from point A to B (e.g., get a key first). You can hide in bushes. The map now has objective markers. Levels are more linear, and I greatly enjoy this as it means the experience with the guards is more handcrafted.

    "comments": "As with Thief and Metal Gear Solid, Tenchu helped pioneer the stealth genre, notably with stealth kills, platforming parkour with the Grappling Hook, and emphasis on stealth movement controls. Tenchu is a stealth-action hybrid, with a lot of gameplay on a pretty strong block/parry/attack moveset system. Playing in 2020, the game doesn't hold up: the worst view distance I've ever experienced where everything past a few feet of you is enshrouded in fog, camera control, no analog stick for movement and other wonky controls, blocky textures, formulaic story, not even a hint of where to go. These all contributed to frequent frustrations.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Most unique to Tenchu's style of stealth over Thief and Metal Gear Solid, Tenchu emphasizes movement, stealth kills (and their many unique animations), camera control, pressing behind and climing up a wall (like Metal Gear Solid), and Ki meter to sense enemies (this happens before you see them especially with the limited view distance). There are several playable characters, with slight differences in movement speed combat damage/reach, and certain mission events. The Grappling Hook is a core platforming item. I think the idea of crouch as an impractical movement speed is interesting. Here, rolling is the approach to sneak as sneaking's movement speed is too slow, and you can run behind an enemy's patrol before they turn around to kill.\n\nThe alert system is local unlike Metal Gear Solid with its infinite respawning guards. Combat is basic but works well, with block, attack, and a number of items in your toolkit. You're strong enough that killing an enemy or two undetected is not a problem. There are no objectives, only vague ideas from the synposis on what to do, making it even more cryptic than Thief. At least there's a map that shows your current location.\n\nThe controls are wonky. Camera control is part of the gameplay difficulty: instead of a manual camera control as a standard for 3D games in the near future, you have to steer your character appropriately while also toggling with L1 to swap to the character's point of view (closer in but not quite first-person). Leaning against a wall doesn't work reliably (and it flat out doesn't work on even slight inclines). You have to exit crouch to turn left/right. There is no strafe. There is no native analog controller support (left) as it was released prior to DUALSHOCK being widely supported. Grappling hook doesn't always work, particularly for any horizontal movement on roofs instead of above you.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The graphics have enough realism to keep it interesting. The blocky textures and character models don't age well. Soundtrack is forgettable. Most noticeable from a gameplay perspective is the significantly narrow view distance, with everything enshrouded in fog, and everything overly dark. English voice acting and dubbed script is bad, with some hilarious B-rated lines.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Pause turns off all sound, ambient soundtracks included. Perfect for alt-tabbing/multitasking.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Moving bodies is possible, similar to Thief and Metal Gear Solid. However, because all performance is based on the player's point of view, if you move away enough from the body, no nearby guard will continue patrolling (let alone discover it).\n+ It's the first time stealth kills appeared in a game, and the mechanic has developed much further since then. Here, you can only do a stealth kill from a flat ground and sufficiently close to them before they notice, raising their weapons. You can't do a stealth kill from an above position to jump on them, or from a wall position, or crouched underneat something.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ For a stealth-action game, they force you to action with the bosses.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Moveset controls](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Tenchu:_Stealth_Assassins/Controls)\n\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/tenchu/comments/79lua6/which_game_should_i_play_first/\n+ [Lobos Plays Tenchu: Stealth Assassins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMZm-sZlKW8)\n\nI played this as my first experience into the Tenchu series. I played with a Playstation 1 emulator: Mednafen with Beetle PSX HW (the RetroArch fork of Mednafen, which adds a GUI). Guide I followed for setup came from the [wiki](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/PlayStation_emulators): [here](https://www.maketecheasier.com/retroarch-ps1-emulation) with internal GPU resolution set at 8x (roughly 1080p native; I'm playing on 2560x1440p so still need to rely on AA; my hardware showed consistently 30 FPS at 16x, but sound was choppy). I played on Normal difficulty, and Ayame over Rikimaru as she's faster at the cost of worse range and combat damage. I played with [Japanese voice turned on](http://www.cheatcodes.com/tenchu-stealth-assassins-playstation/) as the game has English subtitles (it works only partially). I extensively used the emulator's quicksave, treating it like a Deus Ex or Dishonored PC playthrough. It would be annoying to do full stealth playthroughs otherwise.",

    "comments": "Wind Waker is an excellent synthesis of the Legend of Zelda series' strengths: storytelling with rich characters and world, exploration, dungeons, combat, and progression elements. It stands out most against other titles in its timeless cel-shaded graphics and seafaring theme. It is also the first to use a second analog stick, greatly benefiting over previous titles like Ocarina of Time with better aiming. Unfortunately, the overworld's sailing is more tedious than fun, making the world feel disconnected.\n\nOn general flaws for the series, I've always had mixed feelings with Legend of Zelda's use of so many items and with so few keybinds, constantly needing inventory management to swap them as you need them. The game would be better overloading the D-Pad like Dark Souls, or on PC with a keyboard. At the least, provide poweruser shortcuts based on modifier+key. In addition, the difficulty is universally too forgiving, with too few health containers lost when attacked; infinite replenishment of ammo over respawning jars. The optional Piece of Heart collectibles are unnecessary from a gameplay perspective. And the classist, sexism, and racism: Hylian's fair-skinned, blue eyes, light hair whose pure-blood is necessary for max magic power; and Gerudo coming from more the Gerudos with origins like the Middle East or Southeast Asia. \n\n__Story.__ I like the slight changes to the save Zelda the princess formula, with Tetra as a non-traditional Zelda closer to Sheif's role. This time, the story builds on an ancient Hero legend as well as Link departing from a rural area in an attempt to save his sister. Tetra and King of the Red Sea are the cloest replacement to Na'vi, but otherwise the fairy doesn't exist. And a pirate theme!\n\n__Gameplay.__ Core gameplay remains the same with exploration, combat, RPG elements, and puzzles in dungeons, and musical soundbites. New to the combat is a parry system. This all works excellently. Most new to Wind Waker is its world environment with exploration through a 7x7 grid of sea, using bait to fill in each square from a Fishman, and tons of Treasure Chart rewards to find after collecting Treasure Charts. I like the overall idea of it. However, the world is too empty (this is realistic to sea navigation, but doesn't mean it's necessarily good gameplay) and the mechanic of directing wind via a song before you can ever make a turn. The sea in practice makes for a disconnected world, traveling from point A to B. Typical overworlds are on land, benefitting from changes in terrain, trees/bushes/etc., enemies in the overworld, and much more. Nwe to the HD remake, Swift Sail is a crutch upgrade in the midgame that no longer has the second flaw.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Cel-shaded graphics are timeless. I love Wind Waker's orchestral soundtrack.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ [Not any major missable items: only figurines in the Nintendo Gallery sidequest which only rewards a gallery.](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Permanently_Missable_Items)\n+ The Grappling Hook also serves multiple purposes beyond its initial one of latching onto certain obstacles. As a combat purpose, you can steal a power-up/item, which is guaranteed as opposed to relying on drop rates. On the boat, the Hook serves as a crane to pick up sunken treasures.\n+ Like Majora's Mask and other titles, [Wind Waker's fastest movement speed is rolling](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/tww/general-knowledge/movement-mechanics).\n+ There are sufficient places to dump Rupees that you accumulate to avoid reaching the wallet limit: Auction House, Beedle Shop, translate 3 Trifoce charts with Tingle (~1200), Legendary Pictograph for Nintendo gallery (150 each), Guru Statues from Zunari for cosmetics (500 each).\n+ Using a conductor's wand as the instrument.\n+ Forbidden Woods' flower-boost and Leaf item as an approach to Majora's Mask's Deku.\n+ In Wind Waker HD, the tedium in collecting all Triforce Shards is greatly reduced.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Having multiple bags to carry things: monster loot, bait, letters.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Weather time-based system. This overcomplicates the simplistic nature of exploration as now you must also trigger events within certain timeframes.\n+ Fuck 500 hits for Orca's sword training game.\n+ No musicbook to remember the song notes. I have to keep a wiki page open.\n+ Unlike Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, Wind Waker finally benefits from the Gamecube controller's right analog stick for aiming (e.g., bow, manual camera control). However, the mirror shield aiming still uses left analog stick for some reason. I liked the overall idea of using two Mirror Shields in the Earth Temple. But the Mirro Shield's aiming and required switching to Medli is tedious.\n+ It's RNG which parry attack you'll perform against Darknuts. This is particularly annoying when you're fighting multiple, and the roll-backstab against one Darknut's attack immediately runs you into another. Dark Souls doesn't have this issue by either parrying, then hitting a second attack to do riposte which in most titles is an invincible animation.\n+ On Cemu, pressing Tingle Bottle while using the Picto Box softlocks you. It's probably supposed to connect to the web but stops.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI played the HD remaster on the Wii U with the Cemu emulator. I played with the Resolution and Shadow Resolution graphics packs, boosting to 2560x1440p from the original 854x480p resolution; the 30 FPS is locked because of its game speed. I played blind for the majority of the playthrough, using a walkthrough when I get stuck and to pick up all the major upgrades. According to Cemu, I beat the game in 25 hours.",

I wish it were more integrated across the individual levels though. It's fairly sparse otherwise.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Sly Cooper contains elements of 3d platforming, collectithon, and stealth. Interestingly, there is no health: you die from a single mistake although there are generous checkpoints. Coins accumulate to a 100 for an extra life like Super Mario. Clue Bottles enable cracking a vault which adds a new power-up. Other examples are the core platforming controls, platforming-style bosses, hub world.\n\nThe collectithon element with Clue Bottles does not pan well with the linear level design. Backtracking is either impossible or wildly impractical. Fortunately, the power-ups aren't all useful and they all use the same control scheme. For good and bad, the only useful ones are: Fast Dive Attack (1 vault), Dive Collection (4 vaults), Coin Magnetism (5 vaults), Explosive Hat (6 vaults), Water Safety (8 vaults), Move while Invisible (13 vaults), Defy Gravity (14/15 vaults); and none are essential. The way I found the game most enjoyable was to go through a level collecting Coin Bottles as I go, but never backtracking if I don't reach the total number.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The cel-shading and 3D models age well, albeit somewhat in the uncanney valley as the early stage of 3D graphics.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Minigames like At the Dog Track are infuriating without savescumming.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nMotivated to play this after loving the 3D platformers of the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 generation: for example, Super Mario 64, Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, Banjo Kazooie, Conker's Bad Fur Day, Donkey Kong 64, Psychonauts, Jak and Daxter, Ratchet and Clank.

    "comments": "Developed as a spiritual successor to System Shock 2, Bioshock streamlined the experience and added much needed improvements to still enjoy the game in 2020. It captures the essence of System Shock 2's strengths---gripping atmosphere, characters, subtle sound design and enemy ambush cues, logs and ammo to incentivize exploration---and greatly improves upon the combat and RPG elements with streamlining and more modern FPS elements.\n\nFlaw-wise, the shooting gameplay sees its age with no precise aim using a broad crosshair without iron sights, no movement or hiding controls, and generally bullet sponge enemies that run straight at you. I found the enemies particularly turned into bullet sponges late game, costing an inordinate amount of ammo and where it became annoying to use your weapons and limited your gameplay options (Hard difficulty). When it comes to immersive sims, I also found Bioshock somewhat disappointing as it's largely linear with few opportunities for emergent gameplay.\n\n__Story.__ The premise keeps the initial story exciting: exploring an underground civilization after a plane crash, discovering its oddities, desolate culture, and the madman behind it all of Andrew Ryan. The atmosphere with the sound design, ambushes, and enemy aesthetics add to the horror. The plot twist of betrayal.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Bioshock captures the atmosphere of survival horrors, emphasizing exploration by scavenging, resource management in currency and ammo, and maintains light RPG build elements. Enemy types in Bioshock are more memorable and distinct, e.g., Big Daddies. The spiritual succession of System Shock shows. Combat types follows System Shock 2 with plasmids (psionics) and weapons featuring multiple ammo types. Build progression is streamlined with two currencies, dollars and ADAM, tonics as a replacement of skill points, and weapon upgrade machines; you drag-and-drop tonics instead of having to commit to a build; and taking pictures of an enemy type with the camera replaces having to research organs with chemicals in order to gain a passive damage bonus. Level progression follows System Shock 2's but the levels themselves are far more linear with a quest compass (to Bioshock's benefit; System Shock was a maze). Navigation includes hacking stores, turrets, and security cams; and looting items from corpses. Checkpoints are Vita-Chambers, which regenerate your body after you die (surprisingly, with no death penalty including any loss of currency) and do not alter the game state: all enemies killed or partyway damaged before you died remain at that state.\n\nUnlike System Shock, Bioshock includes moral decisions with Little Sisters.\n\nCore gameplay loop ages well. Explore a new area, loot things, explore every crevice and beware of traps or ambushes. The movement and shooting controls are simple and work well: move, shoot, right-click to swap plasmid and weapon, middle-click to swap ammo type, keybinds to quickswap to an item. Enemies only occasionally feeling like bullet sponges but otherwise featuring mechanics that make you feel like you know the right approach to tackle them or dodge their attacks.\n\nLate game, the game replaces enemy variety with health and damage scaling. This makes enemies bullet sponges, where you're forced to blast Splicers with multiple shotgun rounds at point-blank range. Pistol and machine gun are worthless.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The atmosphere is gripping. I'm frequently jumpscared by my own volition with the enemies stalking around. The graphics in the remastered are perfect: it's detailed yet with its own style that feels like it could have been released in 2020. I love the sound designs, particularly in the enemy dialogues that give a sense of their despair while also clueing you into exactly where they are.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ The camera is a perfect example of Bioshock's streamlining to its benefit over System Shock 2. It retains the core idea of putting effort into mastering individual enemy types. And it removes the tedious element of managing an inventory of chemicals of corpse items. Instead, it builds on the core FPS mechanic of shooting, encouraging you to use the camera during action rather than as a separate activity.\n+ Double usage of plasmids for both combat and environment interaction.\n+ Gene banks are great balance between being able to swap out tonics on the fly and having a fixed build in a single playthrough.\n+ Levels have a Little Sisters counter.\n+ Monster infighting between Big Daddies and Slicers.\n+ Aside from the negligible ADAM/Tonic missables with the Save or Harvest Little Sisters choice, there are few missables in the game. The one exception is not killing Sander Cohen to get a Power to the People machine.\n+ I enjoy the hacking minigame. Perfect level of difficulty.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Enemies respawn.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ No accessible menu to see the tonics you equipped or your research level.\n+ Collecting junk items to turn into items in the U-Invent. Did not make a big enough impact in the game. I do like that you can craft not only the rare ammo types but also certain Tonics.\n+ No native borderless support. Fortunately, windowed mode with Borderless Gaming works.\n+ While I enjoy the weapon variety, it's not true weapon variety in encouraging a specific approach for a specific enemy. The pistol and machine gun simply become too weak later in the game, where you rely on close-range Shotgun (of which the 4 max clip isn't enough by Point Prometheus), AOE Chemical Thrower, headshot Crossbows.\n+ Hilarious, I learned from the keybind screen that you can toggle zoom (aim down sights). Hip-fire accuracy isn't actually any lower so there's no real reason to use sights.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.playstationtrophies.org/forum/topic/282669-gatherers-garden-guide-spending-adam\n\nI played the remastered version in BioShock Remastered (2016) on PC. I chose to save the Little Sisters. This makes the beginning more challenging (requiring better gameplay to learn) while giving better rewards in the long run: [the difference in Adam is negligible as you can still buy everything, while you get unique unpurchaseable plasmids from saving](https://bioshock.fandom.com/wiki/Little_Sister_Gift). Otherwise I played blind and on Hard difficulty. This is one step below the hardest (Survivor). I used default keybinds except rebound Equip Weapon 7 (Chemical Thrower) and Equip Weapon 8 (Crossbow) to Q/Z.",

    "comments": "Super Mario 64 (SM64) set the precedent for the 3D platformer genre. Controls with analog stick in a 3D world were innovative, and Mario's moveset significantly increased in complexity with the ability to express personal style. Played in modern times (2020), Super Mario 64's moveset remains one of the most nuanced of all time, favoring momentum over precision. Levels are also well-designed to take advantage of the 3D, and there's a wide variety of enemies and platforming challlenges. The core theme of a platforming world teeming with secrets was executed perfectly.\n\nCon-wise, the game's camera does not age well, being wonky with the lack of proper manual control. I also prefer more direction in knowing the objective where each star is instead of wandering haphazardly. It can be quite annoying overcoming a platforming hurdle but the star is nowhere to be seen.\n\n__Story.__ Typical of Super Mario games.\n\n__Gameplay.__ New to the series, SM64 introduced the concept of a collectathon: a hub world with a core collectible, Power Stars, scattered throughout 15 stages, with a requirement of 70/120 to beat the game. This paved the way for a whole subgenre including games like Spyro, Banjo Kazooie, and Jak and Daxter. HP is renamed the Power Meter with 8 HP, with Coins and Spinning Hearts replenishing them (no longer do you need 100 to do so!). Death means forcible removal of a stage with Game Over returning to the Title Screen. Fortunately, because each level is fairly short, and you forcibly exit the stage and save after every Power Star, SM64 makes for the most forgiving Mario game during its conception.\n\nSuper Mario 64 introduces a myriad of moves to its moveset, placing emphasis more than ever on momentum as king: higher jumps and faster movement at the sacrifice of quick turns and precise air control like its SNES titles. The moveset inherits the usual tap vs hold Jump, Run, Crouch, Ground Pound, Pick Up. And it introduces Double Jump from timing the second jump (Single, Double, and Wall Jumps of which can be made higher by holding the Jump button and/or running), Triple Jump (timing after Double Jump and while moving at a certain speed), Punch with B (Dive with run+B followed by Rollout with A as you land, Kick with jump+B, Slide Kick with run+crouch+B, Sweep Kick with crouch+B), Backward Somersault (a more animated and backwards-moving version of 2D Super Marios' crouch-jump), Long Jump (run+crouch+jump), Wall Jump (jumping toward a wall), Sideflip (run then halt, then choose a direction and Jump), Crawl (with crouch+movement), Ledge Grab.\n\nWhile not all these moves end up being part of a regular gamer's toolkit, they enable emergent patterns. For example:\n\n+ Dive+Rollout for fast ground movement.\n+ Long Jump for far stationary jumps and accelerating from a standstill.\n+ Kick+Double+Triple Jump for highest jumps.\n+ Backward Somersault or Sideflip for high stationary jumps.\n+ Kicks for jumping up slopes.\n+ Rollout off cliffs to circumvent fall damage.\n\nI love the open-endedness of the compactly designed levels. The fast iteration loop with collecting each star is excellent. Most of the time it feels very rewarding to start a new stage and start to pick up all its Power Stars. Each has a sufficiently diverse objective to not feel redundant. Some also have quirks, such as where you enter determining the amount of water in the world, Tiny vs Huge, or Tick Tock Clock.\n\nTerrain includes standard, slopes (with slope areas), hang climbing, snow, sand, water. Power-ups are unlocked by going to certain areas after unlocking enough Power Stars, including Wing Cap, Metal Cap, Vanish Cap.\n\nSM64's camera control is its worst element. Super Mario 64 helped the idea of a manual camera control and is often touted for setting the precedent. But its implementation is not the right one: there are only two buttons to move left and right in the camera, and the camera defaults back to the original view making you feel like you're fighting against the camera as it's stuck to mostly the game's prediction at the best camera angle. In reality, Super Mario 64's camera control is more like Super Mario World's where you can use pan a bit farther to the left/right of a level but you always default back to the game-directed camera. In addition, SM64 features two camera modes: Mario and Lakitu view; and a zoomed-in, normal, and zoomed-out view. You almost always want to stay at the zoomed-out view with Lakitu.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Holding no nostalgia for this game, Super Mario 64's graphics are at the 3D console era where they don't age well. The character models and environments are blocky and pixelated, lacking the pixel precision of its SNES parents and the artistry of succesors like Super Mario Galaxy.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Each Red Coin you collect highlights the current number Red Coins you've collected. No need to count to 8!\n+ There are so many variations given Mario's moveset to be able to obtain a Power Star. Tons of replayability.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ N/A\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Cutscene dialog takes up the whole screen instead of the bottom.\n+ Super Mario 64's underwater stages: fuck Jolly Roger Bay and Dire Dire Docks. Swimming is bad in almost all games (see also, e.g., Banjo Kazooie's Rusty Bucket Bay and Ocarina of Time's Water Temple).\n+ Some stars would be infuriating without the benefit of emulator savescumming. For example: Snowman's Lost His Head, Big Boo's Balcony, Free Flying for 8 Red Coins, Over the Rainbows.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n+ [Super Mario 64 movement guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyu1KO3x5Ps)\n\nI played the remake on the DS via a Nintendo DS emulator (DeSmuME). The remake adds more content with stars, palyable characters, and polished graphics; but the DS lacks an analog stick which even with the 3DS' Circle Pad does not fix. I originally played the game in April 2019 but did not get far. Picking it up again, I replayed the original on Project 64. I got almost all Power Stars (95) except for the ones in each stage requiring collection of all Coins. I found those ones too tedious. I followed the Mario Wiki to find out where all the Power Stars and Secret Levels are as I didn't have the patience to go searching myself.",

    "comments": "As with all Zelda games, Majora's Mask (MM) excels in a number of core assets: lock-style battle mechanics, a classic story rife with colorful details, supporting characters in a world of Zelda-specific bestiary and races, level design, and music (from the background to how it drives the game with the ocarina). What makes Majora's Mask stand above all other titles is its atmosphere, namely in its surrealism and sinisterness. Its side quests and characters also stand out: Skull Kid, Mask Salesman, Bomber kids, Tingle; and sidequests like Anju & Kafei; Business Scrub Scramble; Zora Swan Song.\n\nControversially, MM's world design goes further than just a metroidvania, abiding to a 3-day cycle---an alternative to Ocarina of Time's past and future world timelines. I find the 3-day cycle conceptually interesting and pragmatically infuriating. Time management is tedious, requiring you to complete tasks at the right period, and it was borderline impossible to make progress without a walkthrough in hand. If you don't complete a task in time, say, if it's required in Day 2 or you're 90% through a temple, then you have to go ahead with resetting back to Day 1, then hitting the Song of Double Time to skip to Day 2 or redo the temple. Certain quests also require multiple trials. For example, recompleting Snowhead Temple so you can get the Gilded Sword, re-trekking dungeons for the Frog Choir, or doing most of Anju-Kafei quest to obtain the Sun Mask, Bottle, and Postman Mask. The game is certainly beatable without a guide. But a guide is necessary for MM's core strength, which are all the sidequests.\n\n__Story.__ Main story is darker than any other in the series, with a grim atmosphere of impending doom, progression and lack thereof from the loss of memories. I love its focus on the supporting characters while having a shorter than typical main quest.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Most of the core gameplay is the same as Ocarina of Time with Z-targeting; a sword, bow, items like bombs; heart pieces; ocarina; metroidvania world design; and enemies and races. As part of the N64 era, MM like OOT has some clunky controls, with Z-targeting not always reliable (and if it fails, it changes your camera angle so it's hard to use when trying to target an enemy); and aiming your bow with your left analog stick. Majora's Mask introduces masks, allowing Link to transform into creatures like Deku, Goron, and Zora for new abilities and their own instrument; as well as other masks like Bunny Mask for faster movement and Blast Mask for infinite close-range bombs. I found this mechanic immensely enjoyable: it added depth to Majora's Mask as you use the variety of masks across your journey for exploration; and it adds a collectible. Another major change is the 3-day cycle instead of Ocarina of Time's two-time time travel between future and past.\n\nI greatly enjoy the 3DS' quality-of-life additions, making it my preferred version (see details below).\n\n__Aesthetics & Sounds.__ Graphics are impressive. I especially like the polished detail and less muddy textures in the 3DS remake. 3DS' improved framerate from 15FPS/50hz (PAL) or 20FPS/60hz (NTSC) to 30 FPS is very welcome.The soundtrack is iconic.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ As with all Zelda games, jumping, climbing, etc. is automatically handled for you.\n+ On 3DS, third-person camera control is now possible. This is almost a must-have for modern playthroughs.\n+ On 3DS, Owl Statues no longer provide one-time saves but permanent saves. This is a significant improvement over the need to use Song of Time for every permanent save on N64. In addition, the 3DS remake adds Quill Statues, which add additional save points for easier progression, but do not add to the warp points with Song of Soaring.\n+ On 3DS, Song of Double Time lets Link jump to a specific hour of the current day, making side quests signifiacntly easier to progress.\n+ On 3DS, the main screen's HUD is more minimal than in the original game.\n+ On 3DS, the Bombers' Notebook is expanded, listing Events as a checkmark that you've completed them in a more fine-grained form than the Happy Sticker for each character upon completion of all their quests.\n+ MM requires you to play the songs, so you end up remembering the tunes by muscle memory rather than just click on them from a songbook.\n+ To move the fastest uses a notable mechanic: rolling as Child Link < Bunny Mask < rolling with Goron Mask. Epona is also fast but more difficult to control so it's often not worth using her.\n+ While the game is renowned among all Zelda titles for being difficult to play blind, [MM at least has no permanent missable items or content](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Permanently_Missable_Items#Majora.27s_Mask).\n+ The Restoration Project mod for Majora's Mask 3D fixes Zora swimming, Inverted Song of Time, and, as my favorite quality-of-life improvement, it adds multiple keybinds: the 4 primary masks to the D-pad, I and II buttons to ZR+X/Y, the Ocarina of Time, Item, and Gear menu, and fast Arrow Switching!\n+ The Frog Choir is perhaps the most tedious in terms of tasks. You must recomplete a dungeon boss (Goht) as well as traverse mid-way through Woodfall and Waterfall Temples to defeat their Gekko mini-bosses.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ N/A\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ There are too many items with too few hotkeys as a console game. On 3DS, the I and II buttons have no keybind. You must tap them. In N64, you have 3 keybindable buttons while in 3DS, you have two keybindable and two non-keybindable. MM would be perfect as a keyboard & mouse PC game. There are too many items to use in an area, requiring frequent item swapping for their hotkey which hampers the gameplay, and bow/hookshot/mirror shield aiming is precise with a mouse. [Fortunately, there's a workaround on emulator using Steam Overlay](https://www.reddit.com/r/Citra/comments/fdu5rf/majoras_mask_3d_project_restoration_menu_controls/fk2mdtx), and Project Restoration also adds more keybinds.\n+ All the Piece of Heart fragments in each dungeon. This makes it tedious to find as they're not on the Compass Dungeon Map, so you must resort to a walkthrough.\n+ On 3DS, Link's menu must be tapped and cannot be navigated through the controller.\n+ [On 3DS, Inverted Song of Time is nerfed from 30% reduced in-game time to 50% reduced in-game time](https://github.com/leoetlino/project-restoration).\n+ On 3DS, the most controversial gameplay change is simplifying Zora to a slower swim. I somewhat agree as 3DS misses the fun mechanic of dolphin swimming.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ http://www.zeldadungeon.net/majoras-mask-walkthrough. Caleb Simpson is knowledgeable about the game's trivia, providing unique insights that I wouldn't glean without individually reading up on all the obtuse source references. The walkthrough is thorough and engaging. Just as great as Caleb's Ocarina of Time walkthrough.\n\nI started playing in 2012 right after I played Ocarina of Time. I played via the Project 64 emulator on PC with a Gamecube controller. However, I stopped after Great Bay Temple and right as I started Ikana Canyon. Fortunately Majora's Mask is not so long that starting over is impractical and which I already forgot most details. I played again via the Citra Nintendo 3DS emulator with Majora's Mask 3D at 1440p (my monitor's resolution), 7 years later on 1/6/19, and using a Xbox One controller. I dropped the game yet again right before entering Goron Village but picked it up again on 11/27/20. I installed the [Project Restoration mod](https://restoration.zora.re) (v1.5.8) which greatly added quality-of-life benefits (my most significant complaints are the lack of hotkeys and the nerfed Inverted Song of Time). I reserved any HD mods (HUD, textures) for future playthroughs. I did 100% completion.",

Core combat mechanics are deep in large movesets and weapon variety. Progression system works well with crafting and incentivizes exploration in levels.\n\nFlaw-wise, I wish the game were more challenging in terms of punishing mistakes. Part of this is that unlike Soulsborne games, MHW is more about endurance through a long battle. But I think this style could be made tense: Slay the Spire/Darkest Dungeon are punishing and the major mechanics also lay in macromanagement. I don't prefer this slowness in combat, from enemy moves to your movement and attack speed. I also greatly prefer minimal movesets over MHW's fighting game-style weapon combos.\n\n__Story.__ Apparently a rehash across all entries of the series in the same way Pokemon always tells the same story. It's basic and serviceable. The silent protagonist irks me.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Combat-wise, Monster Hunter World's most unique and interesting elements are: deep weapon movesets and weapon variety, the preparation stage of combat (including monster research, equipment and item loadout, food); movement speed and actions available when sheathed vs unsheathed; resharpening your weapon; recoverable health; potion effectiveness depending on standing or walking; monster mounting mechanic. Combat controls use a fighting game-like moveset with a variety of combos. I don't like this needless complexity, but it's great that after reading online, there is a convergence of just a handful of combos to execute for most weapons. MHW also features strong core mechanics: for example, health and stamina bars, dodge, deliberate timing in weapon moveset execution and enemy attacks; location-based weaknesses on an enemy; environment interaction during monster fights.\n\nMonsters are effectively boss fights taking place over the full level. In the preparation stage, you examine monster research, equipment and item pouch loadout, cooking. In the hunting stage, enemies patrol and you track and hide from them, gathering monster tracks and the like by following your scoutflies. Exploration is incentivized by tracking monsters, collecting items such as gathering and mining, befriending Grimalkynes, talk to First Wyverians. I like the way scoutflies balance exploring to find tracks/items to pick of interest vs automatically showing you where all the monsters are on the minimap as you level up. In the combat stage, it plays like an endurance race. I don't like how this combined with the lack of enemy stagger (on most attacks) often makes the bosses spongey where you need to smack at the enemy for a while. The multiple stages in fleeing and running, enemy moveset, and damaged enemy parts alleviates this a bit.\n\nShops/NPC pitstops are Canteen, Forge, Quest Board, Resource Center, Ecological Research, Provisions Stockpile.\n\nProgression system notably has a lack of RPG tropes like player levels (hunter ranks are meaningless), stat points, and skill trees.\n\nThere are multiple mission types: main mission, optional (side quests), investigations (typically to farm certain monsters so you get bonus rewards), online events, and expeditions (free roam mode). Resource Center has bounties you can complete as additional objectives across missions. Each mission falls into a few different base formulas to keep it diverse: monster hunting, monster catching, escort, fetching items, deliverying items, complete deliveries to set up camps (in resource center).\n\nCrafting system lets you upgrade weapon and armor, as well as combine ingredients to concoct items. Auto-crafting is a great mechanic.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Graphics in the detail, environments, and facial animations are all great. Lip syncing is awful. Only partially voiced.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Fainting's \"death penalty\" is forgiving. There's only a limit for missions, and it only reduces the Zenny reward and food buffs. No dropped items, item durability, or currency.\n+ Like Soulsborne games, you can't pause the game.\n+ You can downgrade (most) weapons and get all materials back. Makes crafting zero cost.\n+ It's always better to capture than kill monsters, when possible.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ The HUD is so busy.\n+ You can't save and quit during a quest or expedition. At least with Soulsborne you could do this.\n+ Missions have a 60 second return timer once you complete them.\n+ Game only autosaves after you complete a quest. It should save before you start one too, as otherwise you lose out on all that preparation and post-quest bookkeeping if you quit on the new quest.\n+ The level mechanics of scoutflies are convoluted though with an unexplained split of scoutfly levels (which is a max of 4 levels across monsters and can decrease) and research (which provides monster information, and never decreases).\n+ Mission objectives, particularly in Optional quests, don't outline very well where objectives you need to gather are located. This is fine for capture/slay quests, where hunting is part of the fun. It's not fun however to parse the obscure map to find the necessary quest objective to loot an item.\n+ MHW is the most streamlined of the series, but it still omits lots of details in explaining mechanics.\n+ Lock aim is dog shit. Free aim works well and fine in this game, so the feature should just be removed.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nThis video analyzing MHWâs combat inspired me to play the game. It adds a bunch of interesting ideas to the table beyond what innovators in the genre like Dark Souls, Devil May Cry, and Sekiro have established. To motivate myself to get into the hurdle of Monster Hunterâs depth, it helped to 1. think of the lore as an new world+guild entrypoint like Toriko the manga; 2. start blind, and learn strategies by reading online after I get acquainted with the basics; 3. easy to eventually go deep into like I did recently for another series (Divinity).\n\nI played with Japanese audio and English text as the game was developed in Japan. I played with controller. I tried to play blind, but resorted to guide whenever I got stuck for too long and wanted some guidance on quest order. Cosmetics-wise, my hunter uses the Geralt-like gruff middle-aged  man preset, and my Palico uses default appearance (named nil and Palico). Quest-wise, I prioritized in order: optional quests that unlock a new mechanic (have a chat bubble), main quests on equal or lower hunter rank, and optional quests to grind hunter rank. I only did investigations for farming; and only select events.\n\nBuild-wise, I first tried the Longsword as my weapon of choice. This was because I prefer a Dark Souls-style DEX build to start things off as it prioritizes positioning, enemy movesets. In contrast, for example, Dual Blades is fairly attack-spammy; and Great Sword is very slow. I chose Chainmail as my starting equipment for aesthetics; I deliberately avoided the Guardian alpha+ and Defender weapons so I could complete base game at its original pace before Iceborne. I swapped to Great Sword as I didn't like the Spirit meter management. Following recommendations online, I upgraded equipment and weapons willy-nilly as I got crafting materials as they're not really used in endgame anyways. I stopped playing the game after the main mission of hunting Diablos.",

Flaw-wise from Doom (1993), it's clear why the latter ages better: Wolfenstein 3D's level designs are tedious 90-degree angle mazes with not enough variety or verticality, and arbitrary secrets gatekeeping progression in certain levels; enemies have significantly less variety and do not encourage diverse weapon usage rather than sticking to only one (no weapon is as iconic as Doom's).\n\n__Gameplay.__ The core gameplay is clearly where Doom (1993) took a lot of ideas: the core FPS controls with movement and interact key, navigating in 2.5D environments, weapon variety, enemy variety, keys, the stats screen at the end of a level, the theme of a fully evil entity that no one would have qualms killing, automap. Coming from the arcade times, treasures serve as a collectible.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Sprites age well. Walls don't.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Wolfenstein 3D was too early to have strafe left/right instead of turn left/right for its movement keys. This makes the original game abysmal in modern times unlike Doom (1993).\n+ All weapons share the same ammo, so you tend to just use the best weapon instead of them all.\n+ Like Doom (1993), dying means restarting the level and losing all your accumulated weapons/ammo.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ maps (but no keys) | https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1325446230\n+ maps with hints including keys | http://www.wolfenstein3d.co.uk/walk1.htm\n\nI played with a map. This helps with one of the most tedious elements of the game, which is navigating where exactly to go. I played on the lowest difficulty \"Can I play, Daddy?\" as I enjoy the power fantasy more than any difficulty in Wolfenstein games. I played on the source port ECWolf, with Borderless Gaming for borderless, and replacing the Steam filename so [Steam monitors my playtime](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2270/discussions/0/540740501104787799). ECWolf adds must-have quality of life features: fullscreen resolution that doesn't go back to windowed mode after alt-tabbing; strafe left/right controls; 16:9 support; always run option; exit in-game menu on pressing Esc again. I also love that it includes the in-game manual which the original game does not feature.",

Each enemy has a unique moveset, requiring you to understand and master how to react. Core gameplay is pretty brutal: you don't restore any health over the course of a Stage unless you find secret walls. Game over after losing all your lives means restarting the Stage.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ 2D sprites age well.

I played a bit of Castlevania games as a child but never a full playthrough. Version-wise, I played the original PC Engine release. It is Japanese-only, so I only played a fan-patched copy taking the English translation from the PSP remake (\"Rondo of Blood (v1.4) win32\" by paul_met). The PSP remake Dracula X Chronicles (DXC) is 2.5D overhauling the 2D sprites with mixed reception. [Additionally, DXC stretches the original PC Engine resolution of 256x224 into 296x224](http://blog.hardcoregaming101.net/2010/03/castlevania-dracula-x-chronicles-pce.html). The Castlevania Requiem rerelease on PS4 is an upscale of the PC Engine, but I prefer playing on PC. The SNES remake Dracula X changes the art style and level design. This game requires quite the patience: I savescummed on the emulator just to experience the game but tried to restrict saving to at the beginning of every zone (unless I started to get frustrated, which was often).",

New is that companion NPCs you come across may also have special abilities like the medics and demolitions to open the next area.

    "comments": "Half-Life is a staple in cinematic linear FPS, combining elements of survival horror, action, and environment action unlike that of any other FPS title. It makes leaps in storytelling in video game history, going beyond prior titles like Unreal, Quake II, and Shadow Warrior, and released around the time of System Shock 2, Deus Ex, and Silent Hill. The core gameplay is also excellent in its level design encouraging exploration, enemy variety each with distinct roles encouraging different weapon usage, and environment variety. Development-wise, Valve's focus on open-source code and engines have also paved the way for titles like Counter-Strike and Team Fortress. As a remake, I don't know what really changed, but it's obvious that Black Mesa's significant overhauling of the Xen four chapters was an improvement. Xen is Half-Life's equivalent of Dark Souls' Lost Izalith. Xen is still Black Mesa's worst part of the game, particularly Interloper.\n\nFlaw-wise, there's little even when playing and evaluating the game without its historical origins. Game relies on manual saving moreso than checkpoints. Enemy AI is wonky, particularly HECU who have auto-aim and with the lack of stealth. Some controls are dated.\n\n__Story.__ Story holds up in 2020. As a Ph.D. myself, I find the trope of geniuses gone wrong still works well here. Loading screens are abrupt in freezing the screen.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The game is part survival horror (just as the game was figuring out its genre elements with smashes like Resident Evil and Silent Hill), part FPS action-adventure, and part puzzle-solving with environmental interaction and exploration. Solid core FPS, with exploration for ammunition and weapons within linear areas. Light physics environment interaction is revolutionary, enabling more varied approaches to progress in level and solve some light puzzles. Excellent enemy variety.\n\nControls are simple and intuitive. I'm pleasantly surprised just how much of the controls haven't changed much since then, showing Half-Life was really at the peak of where the FPS genre solidified. For example, Doom was still earlier in the stages without even mouselook until years later. My only nits are the weapon selection in pressing a button to select a weapon type (e.g., medium weapon) followed by the specific weapon (e.g., Assault Rifle). There's too many choices here. I'd prefer Call of Duty's approach of limiting a select number of weapon carries and forcing you to choose which ones to keep around, or Doom's approach of keeping the full variety but distinguishing the role of each item. Long jump system is also weird in that thjere's a meter you must explicitly monitor.\n\nThe overhauling of Xen in graphical fidelity is great, and I loved roughly the first two hours with the game treated much like a survival horror. Hours, my patience started to run in as the facility (Interloper chapter) especially just felt extremely tedious to find where to go next. Xen feels closer to a DLC/expansion standalone rather than the final chapters of a game, where you would wish it would end already.\n\nWeapons feature enough variety and serve core purposes, each with a primary and secondary style to their attack. The crowbar is perhaps the pinnacle representation of Half-Life in its use as both a powerful infinite melee attack and in destroying obstacles in the way. This is also one of the first games with environment-based weapons, i.e., turrets.\n\nHealth system uses the Doom approach of 100 max health, 100 max armor. There are First Aid stations that allow to heal up to a limit, adding to the feeling of finite health.\n\nDeath penalty and save system is reliant on auto saves and manual saves. Like many PC games at the time, Half-Life is designed with quicksaves in mind as the autosaves are too infrequently to rely solely on.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Remembering brief scenes particularly in the beginning of the game, I'm astounded by the increased resolution, lighting, and soundtrack. I don't know what artistic differences there are from the original game, but Black Mesa is truly a modern rerelease in terms of polygon count and graphics polish. The graphics show visible age in 2020 rather than 10 years ago. The soundtrack is particularly impressive. Some areas are more visually upgraded than others, leading to a weird inconsistency sometimes. It has voice acting!\n\nThe environment variety is quite impressive for its time. Facilities (across many different parts, from the scientific research areas to partially sunken areas to recycling), New Mexico outdoors, Lambda facility, Alien outerworld. Xen is especially a marvel in artistic flair, clearly taking on an aquatic inspiration. I love its integration of human settlement assets early in the levels, showing a progression of where the Black Mesa Research Facility had already explored until later where you've gone where no man has before.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Unlike any other game, all cutscenes are rendered in-game. This was done at the same time as Metal Gear Solid (1998).\n+ Black Mesa has quality-of-life game options like Always Run (otherwise you would hold Sprint) and Fast Weapon Switch (you don't have to use the archaic system of selecting a weapon with your hotkey, then pressing the mouse button to swap to it).\n+ All the NPC side companions you bring along in the beginning of the game for a brief amount of time. Whether you save them or have them die is purely for amusement.\n+ Monsters vs human NPC fighting. I love the feeling of pick off a side so that both forces end up being greatly demolished.\n+ Unlike a linear FPS like DOOM (2016), the game doesn't really have the feeling of synthetic \"arena\" fights. There is some artificial enemy spawning, but the levels mostly feel more natural as enemies already appearing, and you encountering them as you progress.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ N/A\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Black Mesa's human enemies HECU have perfect aim, which can be frustrating.\n+ Like most old FPS games, projectiles like frag grenades are treated like any other weapon and therefore a bit of a drag to use.\n+ You wouldn't expect advanced AI in a game this old. But it would be nice to at least enable some stealth option. They just immediately detect you so there's little no element of surprise.\n+ There was a frustrating jump pad that I couldn't get to land onto a tree path, even after watching a walkthrough to precisely land the jump. Not sure if bug. I just enabled noclip to fly onto it.\n+ The facility platforming area in Xen after you beat the Gonarch is so tedious. Had to resort to a walkthrough as the pathing often is arbitrary.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI first tried this game in October 2012 and did not get very far. Playing it again, I initially tried Black Mesa difficulty (the Normal equivalent in the original Half-Life). Challenging FPS combat is not necessarily Half-Life's strong suit, and so I simply chose for what I expect to be the most balanced and developed difficulty level. However, as I started to fight HECUs, I found the duck and shoot, savescum if you lose too much health, approach to be too overbearing for enemies like marines so I just kept it on Normal (equiavlent to Half-Life's Easy). Playing this game in 2020, I'm evaluating the game by itself, not in contrast to Half-Life 1 which I barely remember having played it more than a decade ago as a kid. I played blind, only resorting to a walkthrough whenever I get lost.",

There is no run. Health is defined by moving too far from Baby Mario for a total of 10 seconds, and which slowly refills. Levels no longer have a timer. There are still power-ups, e.g., helicopter, Poochy, Super Baby Mario, mole, car. There is no climbing platforming, replaced with mini-platform stairs. Bosses are all uniquely designed and creative.\n\nDeath penalty-wise, Yoshi's Island is one of the earliest games adopting the modern trend of auto-saving, enabling permanent completion of a level (~2000-2020 at least). Here, the death penalty simply means restarting the existing level and at the latest checkpoint. Game Over after running lives means losing checkpoint progress, but not multiple level progress as in all previous titles.

I found this game very enjoyable to play in modern times: this is partially attributed to being an original Crash and Spyro platformer, already appreciating the horizontality with spin/roll attacks over speed-momentum-based jumps and power-ups; and the art just holding well (SNES games are the pinnacle of 2D platformer art). \n\n__Story.__ There's not much of a story in DKC much like Super Mario. Unlike a damsel in distress, I like that it's more simply a friendship between Donkey and Diddy Kong and the aim to restore their stolen bananas from the Kremlings.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Core gameplay shares traits with SMW: world map and level progression, Bananas and Super Coins to fill up Lives, a death penalty when running out of lives by restarting at the latest save point, secrets, and a mount. Control-wise, Small Mario and Super Mario is replaced with Donkey and Diddy Kong who each have unique traits: to highlight several, Donkey has Hand Slap; and Diddy moves slightly faster and jumps higher but cannot roll through enemies like Krusha. Roll/Cartwheel replaces Mario's Spin Jump. Holding the jump button still determines height, as well as whether one is running. There are five mounts (\"Animal Buddies\"): Rhino, Swordfish, Frog, Ostrich, and Parrot. Star Barrels serve as the approach to checkpoints within a level.\n\nGiven the new IP, Donkey Kong Country comes up with significant number of ideas in level design, emphasizing horizontality over Mario's verticality, and which reminds me of Crash Bandicoot games (especially given that Roll is like Crash's Spin). Rainy areas cast darkness on areas. Barrels enable alternative platforming to Mario's Pipes. Red light Green light. There is no timer on levels, incentivizing exploration. Unlike Mario, there aren't puzzle levels like Ghost Houses: it's always straightforward that the farthest to the right area is the end of the level, which I appreciate.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The platformer took a unique approach distinguishing itself from the Mario series with its blended 3D realism fused into the 2D environments. Environments focus on jungles and exotic creatures.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Boss fights are standalone levels. This is significant quality of life improvement over SMW, where to even do trial and error on a boss you have to run through an entire level all over again. That's even worse than the infamous Dark Souls run to bosses!\n+ Unlike Super Mario games prior to it, DKC has no timer in levels. This is a clear relic of arcades as part of a scoring system and it's not surprising that Nintendo removed it from future games.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Mine Cart Carnage is a breath of fresh air in terms of a new level and platforming challenge. The difficulty spike is pretty insane however and I'm sure I wouldn't have enjoyed it if I didn't savescum by reloading the game, effectively assuming I had infinite lives. The secret in the level to skip it is a hilarious punch in the gut.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Like SMW, the ability to save is obtuse. You have to find Candy's Save Barrel, which requires finding candy or funky in the world. Otherwise you must go back to the previous world either using Funky's Flights if you unlocked it in the level or manual traversal to get back to Candy's Save Barrel. It's at least an improvement over SMW's save point system which requires you to re-complete certain levels. Similar to SMW, I just used the emulator to save at each level so that I don't deal with this.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI played various parts as a kid somewhere around 1997-2000 but never completed it.

    "comments": "Super Mario Wold is a more polished SMB3. Ultimately I find it the more replayable game with its more forgiving save point system, 16-bit SNES pixel art, and simply better gameplay. I find both to be truly excellent, reigning among the best platformers of all time. I attribute SMB3 only slightly more in terms of innovation and attribute SMW only slightly more in terms of overall gameplay.\n\n__Gameplay.__ SMW is SMB3 but refined even further: more diverse levels (e.g., in environments and types such as Ghost Houses, caves, new renditions of lava levels with moving platforms to follow the entire level), refined character controls, enemies, and checkpoint system. Novelty-wise, it's the first game with Yoshi who effectively provides an infinite life source on levels he appears (if you can get him back after he runs away when you get hit), double jump, various attacks after consuming an enemy or berry. Spin Jump also becomes the new A button, replacing Pick Up Item / hold to Run which now becomes Y, alongside Jump as the first. Features new power-up of Cape Mario which is even better than Tanooki Mario and generally the best power-up, hence the default over Fire Mario. Simplifying things from SMB3, there is no longer a P-Meter which I felt was unnecessary, but SMW still enables momentum in moving faster up to a limit does increas your jump height and enable you to fly when as Cape Mario. There is also no overworld collection of items, instead having a single item slot not unlike Mario Kart games. Yoshi coins offer another approach to gain more lives. You can now aim up when shooting Koopa shells.\n\nPlatforming and overworld-wise, SMW introduces Dotted-Line Blocks which require visiting a Switch Palace in order to make interactable. There are Midway Gates and Giant Gates. Climbable fences.\n\nDeath penalty-wise, for the first time in the Super Mario series, you have a save point every few levels, based on the latest completed castle, fortress or haunted house. Now you no longer have to deal with the punishing Continue system, which either did not exist (SMB1), was finite (SMB2 and SMB3 JP version), or was still quite brutal for harder worlds as it always reset the entire world sans a few elements (sometimes this is 9 whole levels). Technically, you can manually save in Super Mario World by re-beating a Ghost House. This is obvious quite menial, and it's no wonder future ports enable a more explicit save option. In addition, SMW features Midway Gates which serves as the first explicit checkpoint system in the series. I still savescummed as I wanted to breeze through the game without getting frustrated, but I only saved at every checkpoint. This proceeds as if I continually farmed 99 lives by grinding a certain level (particularly the Koopas in 1-2).\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ As the first game to be released on the SNES, Super Mario World is far more colorful than prior titles in the SNES leap from 8-bit to 16-bit. The soundtrack is more expansive and remains iconic. SNES games are truly the pinnacle of pixel art and I would enjoy SMW even if it were released in modern times as if it were another indie 2D platformer.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ The game is perhaps the most user-friendly of the series with ? blocks that provide tutorial information about controls.\n+ You can get Bonus Stars from cutting the tape, and depending on the height you cut it at, when reaching the goal; otherwise you just get 1 Coin. Bonus Stars accumulate to play a minigame that rewards Mario Lives. It's a nice bonus but is never truly necessary as it's very easy to farm Lives.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Pressing L/R provide the camera control in select levels.\n+ The secret exit necessary for Forest of Illusion's Roy Castle. And other exists like the cape flying over a bottomless pit in Chocolate Island 3.\n+ Castle levels remain fairly unforgiving in their difficulty with the lack of any checkpoints.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI played on the emulator Higan as it is the most accurate SNES emulator.",

It feels most like a complete game.\n\n__Gameplay.__ SMB 3 notably introduces a world map for the first time in the series with fortress and enemy levels, and also features several new power-ups: Tanooki (Racoon), Frog, Hammer.

This is coming 2 years after the first Legend of Zelda game, which featured a save. SMB3 should have had this too. I personally did not have the patience still so I ended up savescumming in order to treat the platformer more casually.

There are several distinct gameplay elements as it originated from Doki Doki Panic. Level designs are far more creative and diverse than SMB1. But certain levels are quite frustrating in trial-and-error, ultimately making some aspects of the game punishing in its few lives and continues.\n\n__Gameplay.__ SMB2 has distinct gameplay elements from other Mario games, coming from its base of another Japanese game Doki Doki Panic. Instead of instant death, you now have a Health Meter. There are no coins. Foes can no longer be defeated by jumping on them, relying on lifting up items/enemies to throw at another. There's huge enemy variety each different but introducing new ones to the Mario series, ultimately derived from Doki Doki Panic, e.g., Shyguy. SMB2 also introduces new items like POW, cherries, bombs, and potions. There are significantly more bosses, making it mechanically quite challenging given the few amount of mistakes you can make. Some of the flying levels are especially punishing in trial-and-error, effectively wasting tons of lives to both learn and retry if you didn't play the level before.\n\nCore platforming controls are same as SMB1. There are some slight differences: high jump by holding B is replaced by a squat jump down by holding Down, then pressing B. There are climbable assets and doors you enter with Up. Instead of running into a shell to pick it up like SMB1, you can more simply press A when above it.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Colors are vibrant and age well.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ For the first time in the series, you can go backwards within the level.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ N/A\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Death penalty-wise, SMB 2 adds 2 extra Continues after lives run out.

Much of it plays like Doom and excels for those reasons.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Plays effectively like a 3D Doom, with vertical aiming required: unique enemy types, navigation with keys to unlock doors, secret areas, health/armor/ammo resource management, and weapon variety with no reloading. Keeping \"always run\" makes movement speed feel quite fast similar to Doom. Like Doom, the game's core gameplay loop holds well in modern times. Interestingly, unlike Doom, Quake doesn't have a Use key, with things automatically opening when you get close. One huge quality-of-life change over Doom and Doom II is that the death penalty restarts the level, but you still retain your original weapons, ammo, and health/armor. In Doom, dying is such a harsh penalty reverting you back to the pistol, and while maps are designed to enable you to succeed with just the pistol, it's a huge step back from your original position. Levels spanning over 10 minutes are still hugely punishing in terms of the death penalty though, so later in the game I went back to save scumming and not enjoying it as much.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Graphics remind me of Thief. The soundtrack is more ambient than metal like the Doom series.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Many weapons are strictly useless: shotgun, nailgun, and grenade launcher as they each have an upgraded counterpart. It would be good to have default keybinds that just leverage those 3 upgraded variants; and be able to separately keybind the lesser versions for advanced players. Otherwise you have to awkardly weapon switch with 3, 5, 7.\n+ It's easy to have accidentally picked something up and not noticed. The prompt is easy to miss; modern games, e.g., also incorporate a sound and better animations.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [How to track Steam playtime with sourceports?](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2310/discussions/0/1471967615851328227)\n\nThis entry does not include the two expansion packs and only evaluates the single player campaign.

I don't always have patience for boomer shooters, so I played at Normal difficulty just to experience the game; and then went down to Easy for the last two episodes. I figure if I enjoy this, I'll enjoy further 3D Doom-like games such as further Quake titles, Dusk (and other New Blood Interactive games), and Serious Sam.",

    "comments": "BL3 improves upon previous titles in its core controls, level variety, action skill variety, and item drops. It adds two core flaws: poor main story and bad level design. The main campaign is completely lacking across story and characters, making the overall grind in traversing level to level to complete missions somewhat of a chore. The level design also feels lazier in its emptiness and disconnectedness, encouraged by the new ability to fast travel from the map which I despise, and with the disparate planets with a disconnected hub.\n\nMy criticisms may partially be attributed to a different mindset where I may have gotten tired of the formula since BL1, BL2, and BL TPS. However, the two new flaws strongly ruined my enjoyment, and the looter shooter's core flaws persist with the early grind in lacking powers/weapon variety, the bullet sponge combat, lack of distinguishing enemy designs (c.f. DOOM) that fundamentally change the rhythm of combat, and unbalanced endgame.\n\n__Story.__ Borderlands 3's biggest flaw is its story. You play a side character to a boring main character, Lilith, and fight against forgettable villains of Tyreen or Troy who are Twitter personified (namely, cringe). I enjoy the quirky characters in the overall Borderlands series. However, BL3 teeters on quirkiness for the sake of quirky, and the joke writing is too transparent and lacking depth. For example, the way Maya just dies is insulting compared to how Roland was at least handled in BL2; it would have been more impactful to have Lilith die. Ava as Maya's preteen replacement sucks, and recurring characters like Marcus, Moxxi, Claptrap, and Tiny Tina don't make much of an appearance to shine or develop unlike previous titles.\n\nI despise the decision to go to any fast travel stations from the map. It breaks world connectivity, and makes areas more like a disparate set of continuous paths, only continuous for completing a certain mission and otherwise you teleport out. This maks BL3 the least \"open world\" of the series.\n\nOn the positive side, I do like that they introduce manufacturer characters, adding more depth to the persistent world across games. Side quest stories I played are forgettable, but there are apparently some good and quite dynamic in quest objectives that I didn't play.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The core gameplay loop remains the same with tight FPS combat with ability skills; RPG progression in leveling, skill trees, and loot; and quest-based semi-open-world navigation. Enemy movesets seem noticeably more diverse and responsive with dodging attacks. There are more bosses in the campaign each with varied mechanics. Controls are more responsive and newer movement options: sliding and mantling; it also carries over BL TPS' ground pound. Radiation element replaces BL2's Slag although it isn't ever made a core part of the game so it ultimately becomes a useless added mechanic. Classes now feature multiple action skills. More weapon modifiers and variety, such as switching between elements on one weapon with alternate shooting modes. Guardian Ranks are a variant of Borderlands 2's Badass System: however, it's accessible only at the endgame and account-wide instead of character-wide.\n\nOn endgame. BL3's TVHM replaces Borderlands 2's third playthrough of UVHM, which is greatly appreciated for the campaign grind. Mayhem is the take on OP levels, failing in being an unbalanced health and damage scaling at high levels. However, it does add enemy modifiers to at least make it more mechanically challenging than BL2's OP levels.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ BL3 inherits the iconic cell-shaded style, advanced further in seamlessly blending with realism. For example, the game has more unique shooting animations per weapon type, making gunplay feel more weighty. Objects are also interactible, enabling destructive cover. Borderlands 3 newly involves planets across levels, enabling more creative freedom in variety than Borderlands 2. However, it sacrifices Borderlands 1 and 2's interconnected levels, making BL3 feel less like an open-world game. Character designs push even further in diversity of LGBTQ, which I think is great in strides (e.g., Ellie being a lesbian in The Last of Us) but feels too forced when it's every character like in BL3.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ You can press a single button to refill all ammo at the vending machine. Holy shit, what a quality of life improvement!\n+ You don't have to spam E to pick miscellaneous items like money and ammo! I think Borderlands 3 was the first to make this quality-of-life improvement.\n+ For the first time, fall damage no longer exists.\n+ You can use [ and ] as a shortcut to cycle the tracked quest. No going back to the quest log to identify what quest objective is closest.\n+ Lost machine helps you guarantee getting all loot you may have missed.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ The even more cosmetic options, with customizable vehicle parts, weapon trinkets, room.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Unlike BL2, there is no ignore mission to more easily organize missions.\n+ Mail option. Unnecessary bloat feature.\n+ Borderlands Science minigame. Unnecessary.\n+ Eridium still exists as a secondary currenct on top of $, but there's literally no purpose to them anymore (unlike their need for SDU upgrades).\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://bl3skills.com/beastmaster/#5050301330510000000000000530030533121\n+ https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Borderlands_3_mission_flow\n\nI played on normal (the maximum) difficuly. The story was forgettable and I played much of the game with a stream on the side monitor. Similar to my playthroughs for BL1 and BL2, on my first playthrough, I did minimal side missions to be on-level or slightly under for main missions. TVHM benefits from level scaling and replaying quests from scratch, leveling Guardian Ranks and playing in Mayhem Mode in the meantime. However, TVHM doesn't really add anything the frequency of badasses and annointed enemies, so I decided to skip it altogether and I didn't feel compelled to even play the DLCs. Ideally, starting TVHM, I would main misisons, any side missions I did not already experience to level up, then obtain max level (when I played, this is 65) at Mayhem 10 (or the most balanced Mayhem, with maybe Mayhem 6 at minimum for all Mayhem-exclusive items), and then complete DLCs in chronological order. This lets me appreciate a good amount of content under endgame balancing, which I enjoyed in my BL2 playthrough.\n\nI chose Fl4k as I most enjoy the high DPS, aggressive run and gun, and glass cannon style with pistols from BL1's Mordecai and BLTPS' Nisha, increased movement speed, and an active action skill. I ruled out Amara as I don't want to play another Lilith from Borderlands 2. I ruled out Zane who's apparently the BL3 version of BL2's Axton and the weakest of the 4.",

These elements include atmosphere, nonlinear exploration, inventory and resource management, and upgrades. Playing in 2020, I found some elements of the resource management and the clunky combat too tedious to truly enjoy. However, I can appreciate its influence. The backtracking in getting lost, combined with enemy respawns, gets frustrating.\n\n__Story.__ Pretty standard ship gone wrong with AI and infestations. It's the presentation that makes it more interesting than the core story though.\n\n__Gameplay.__ System Shock 2 is about exploration, with build variety, FPS combat, hacking, resource management, psi skills. I enjoyed the core loop of exploring a new area, picking up PDAs and playing them as you continue exploring, killing off enemies while you scrounge for resources and complete the next objective.\n\nThe UI is needlessly complicated. Fortunately, it's at least a significant improvement from System Shock 1, which I found unplayable. Too many things seem neat in adding to the realism but ultimately add to the tedium in practice. For example, I like the idea of chemical storage rooms that are cluttered with resources, and limiting what you can actually pick up due to limited inventory space. However, it's just annoying to have to backtrack to this area, or otherwise wait in this area, as you research new unidentified objects to pick up the necessary chemicals.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Graphics remind me of Deus Ex, which came a year later.

I found this vital for rushing through the game when I got too bored and would otherwise abandon playing.\n+ In Easy difficulty at least, you get infinite revives so health is effectively infinite.\n+ There are mission objectives that give you some guidance on what to do next but aren't blatantly obvious.\n+ Surprisingly, you can mantle in this game.\n+ When you purchase from the vendor, it doesn't automatically go into your inventory. You have to pick it up.\n+ Resources like items, ammo, and chemicals appear realistically: corpses, storage rooms, enemies.\n+ Everything happens in realtime. I would occasionally get jumpscared when I'm busy managing my inventory, turn around, and there's an enemy jumping me.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ You can't sell items at a vendor. You must rely on picking up a recycler.\n+ Radiation and toxic areas are a pain to explore if you're playing blind. Much save-scumming here.\n+ Default movement speed is abysmally slow. Fortunately the build I'm using starts the game with 2 Agility.\n+ Enemies respawn. Then again, this is the only way to accumulate otherwise finite resources.\n+ Implants require recharge. I wish they didn't so you didn't constantly feel time pressure to otherwise backtrack to the recharge station.\n+ Like the original game, grenades don't have their own hotkey making them a pain to use.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ most popular build on steam | https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=569509913\n+ https://shodan.fandom.com\n+ guide with pictures |https://portforward.com/games/walkthroughs/System-Shock-2 \n\nI played on Easy difficulty given the unforgivingness and tedium of old games.

There aren't emergent gameplay elements, but there are enough random encounters to keep it interesting for a few hours. I enjoy the various options for navigation, and with narration. The turn-based combat is sufficient, not excelling or being a pain to play in managing actions to take over a bar not unlike tactics games like Divinity with AP.\n\nProgression is about resource management. I liked the various options in managing Stamina (health), Reason (like Darkest Dungeon's sanity), Funds, stats that are important for skill checks, and combat stats (STR/DEX/PER).

I hate that it's unexplained exactly what each stat does, making it difficult to determine what's important for what.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The art stands out and is why I picked up the game.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ The UI is hard to navigate, but it does grow on you once start playing as it appeals to the weirdness of 90s RPG UIs like System Shock.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ No borderless support. Windowed mode + Borderless Gaming works though.",

    "score": "7",
    "date_started": "10/15/20",
    "date_finished": "10/23/20",
    "comments": "Persona 3 is a unique mix of the JRPG and visual novel genres. It blends well the two core loops of combat and relationship-building. I like the rhythm that the game offers in balance. Both are slightly grindy but feel great in its formula of progressing both: spending days maximizing Social Links, and then evenings in Tartarus for some days and maximizing attributes during the rest. I like both the novelties in balancing both elements as well as the new mechanics for JRPG combat such as Personas and emphasis on exploiting elemental weaknesses.\n\nFlaw-wise, the combat can be tedious and heavily RNG, trial-and-error-based, and frequently with difficulty spikes: I hate going to Tartarus as opposed to increasing my Social Links. The reliance on party member AI adds to the RNG. In addition, there's quite a bit of missables and lack of explanation around mechanics like who exactly to contact for Elizabeth's requests or some Social Links. The managing of up to 21 Social Link schedules can also be quite annoying without constant referencing to a guide on who's available for a certain day. Finally, the game runs a little too on the long side, feeling a bit redundant around November; they could easily cut out July/August events in the game. By December I steamrolled through the game just to finish it.\n\n__Story.__ It's a somewhat generic anime story, appealing to the Japanese artistic sensibility of abstraction and weirdness even when unnecessary. For example, shooting oneself with guns is obviously a stylistic choie, but only adds edge rather than meaningful symbolism. Things just happen in the overall story without much explanation or substance: various people die, betrayals happen, and there aren't motivations underlying them. \"The power of friendship surges in you!\" Persona 3's story does do well in standalone character background.\n\n__Gameplay.__  Persona 3 combines JRPG and visual novel elements.\n\nJRPG-wise, Persona inherits the turn-based combat standards while also featuring several novelties: the 1 More mechanic and All-Out attack from knockdowns; exploiting elemental affinity (strengths on you, weaknesses on enemies) for such knockdowns; striking enemies when they appear during area navigation for a preemptive turn; inheriting skills from Personas which themselves level and can fuse to make new ones; and a select one-of-X card-based loot system almost reminiscent of roguelikes. Persona also introduces a condition, which affects combat, encouraging you to balance well between not going purely to Tartarus every day.\n\nThe combat is fun, appealing to a grindy Dragon Quest style with its own rock-paper-scissors quirks like Pokemon. It's a trial and error whenever you first attempt to identify an enemy's weakness, lacking Pokemon's obvious visual style that makes it easy to tell a Pokemon's type at first glance. Once you do know weaknesses, the repetitiveness can be quite fun in adding a sort of rhythm. The game can be frustratingly RNG-based in its one-hit-kills though.\n\nVisual novel-wise, Persona inherits character story paths in the form of Social Links, and which have light combat effects. Social Links can be largely ignored from a gameplay-only perspective, adding increased benefits from fusions and adding a new Persona after max rank for each Social Link; these benefits are minor, and I like this this choice because of how easy it is to miss Social Links. I wish however that Social Links were easier to track, find, and not ultimately be missable: by doing this, you can be safely ensured to have experienced the content from a blind playthrough, and therefore Social Links can also be designed with a bigger gameplay impact.\n\nPersona also features social attributes---Charm, Academics, and Courage---which enable various activities (e.g., Home Economics Social Link is only available when Academics is improved). The idea behind these make sense, and they indeed remain a staple in the Persona series as a way of defining \"stats\" for Persona's social half. In practice, however, Persona 3's three social stats only enable a handful of Social Links in the game: Home Economics, and three others each for maximizing a social attribute. I wish Persona had better integrated social attributes into the dialogue and rest of the game, similar to skill checks in western RPGs.\n\nBlending JRPGs and visual novels, Persona 3 progresses on a day-by-day basis with story events appearing on a per-determined basis, and with a set number of months before the game truly ends. This places you on a time limit to complete each dungeon to be ready for the next Full Moon boss. I find these deadlines worked well: it encouraged you to level up and progress in combat, but also know when you should stop and start spending the rest of your time on maximizing Social Links and attributes.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ I'm a fan of the art style. It ages well playing it more than a decade later. The soundtrack is awesome albeit repetitive 50 hours in. Not even knowing the story when initially playing, I was hooked by its score. Dialogue is mostly voiced.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ L1 + select enemy lets you see an enemy's weakness, or analyze it if you haven't already analyzed the enemy type.\n+ Level 1 of Tartarus party heals. You can do this anytime, with the tradeoff of it cutting you off if a party member is Tired, or you don't have a waypoint to go back to the specific floor. This also means your HP and SP go full when you start a new day.\n+ The Split Up feature is pretty useless. By the time this is viable for individual members to take on shadows, it's better off fighting at higher floors as a party rather than dealing with unequal XP gain.\n+ You can use a button that's not X to advance dialogue. But it won't select a choice, so you can use it for spamming dialogue so you don't accidentally make a wrong decision.\n+ Magic spells have an easy to follow prefix/suffix: e.g., agi is base, mag+ means \"apply to all targets\", and +ion/+dyne are stronger versions.\n+ It's not too hard to control the RNG from fusing Personas. Just exit the fusion menu, then reenter to see a new outcome.\n+ In FES version, you can walk Koromaru at nights. This doesn't do much with the occasional item reward or happiness-building in Social Links. I like that it's a nice filler for Evenings however when you have nothing else to do, namely, after exhausting attributes and night-based Social Links.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Missable social links and Elizabeth's Requests if you don't complete them in time.\n+ Too many loading screens filled with small maps.\n+ You have to talk to your party members in order to see their status and equipment. Much more annoying than just changing from the main menu like your main character.\n+ You can only save your game at night or before beginning Tartarus. This is too infrequent, sometimes over 20 minutes in difference.\n+ You have to remember the specific set of Persona cards that you own. Otherwise you may pick a Persona during card selection that you already own, which is a waste.\n+ You have to remember each Persona's skills and weaknesses. You can only select one in battle, so it's effectively trial and error until you know not only the enemy's weakness but which Persona you have that best matches it.\n+ In typical visual novel fashion, you can't just be very good friends with a girl. Social ranks >=5 with girls mean dating them.\n+ To do best in exams, you need to maximize academics very early, sacrificing time spent elsewhere. And the rewards are meager.\n+ Item selection per party member and skill selection per Persona is very tedious. There's no global menu making it easy, e.g., who a new item can be given to.\n+ Certain time periods are not handled well. In the summer, \"after school\" is effecitvely replaced with daytime, and you lose access to upgrading all Social Links at school. Instead you have mini-dates in the daytime that don't actually progress the corresponding Social Link. I would rathey they don't provide any mini-dates since they're deceiving; instead, just recommend to use the time to maximize non-school Social Links.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://shin-megami-tensei-persona.fandom.com/wiki/Pop_Quiz_dates_and_answers\n+ https://www.neoseeker.com/persona-3/faqs/153211-attributes-theellimist.html\n+ https://sites.google.com/site/persona3fessociallink/\n+ https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/937269-shin-megami-tensei-persona-3-fes/answers/21873-who-is-the-best-party-for-you\n\nBy fandom references, I chose this one as my first entry to the Persona series (and I suppose Shin Megami Tensei more broadly). It's the first true Persona game in the modern style as the first two are closer to SMT. Version-wise, P3P's significant changes are controllable party members and a female MC option; P3P removes the epilogue (The Answer), anime cutscenes, and walking around the overworld. Therefore I played FES using a PS2 emulator (PCSX2 v1.6.0 with 4x Native so from 480p to roughly 2560x1440), Xbox one controller, and with the following additions: a ROM with undub and \"original BGM\" (I assume original means an option for undubbing; it wasn't clear to me if there's a soundtrack change from original Persona 3 to Persona 3 FES). There's both a controllable party members and a widescreen (16:9) patch but I prefer to play according to the original.\n\nI mostly played blind but did use guides for maximizing exam answers, attributes, most Social Links, and knowing teleport levels for Tartarus. I played on Normal difficulty; in retrospect, I almost wish I played Easy because of the grind, RNG, and difficulty spikes. I felt my playthrough could have been easier if I spent more time monitoring skills obtained during Persona fusions and maintaining good equipment purchases; but I didn't enjoy this micromanagement. I beat The Journey in 58 hours (according to save game data; I wish I learned about PCSX2's Turbo mode much earlier, not in January!); I did not play The Answer as I got bored of The Journey.\n\nI generally go to Tartarus ASAP to complete the section until the next block, halting when my party members get tired. Then I go to maximize Social Links (typically afternoons) and attributes (typically evenings).\n\n+ Social Link-wise, I try to level them all equally. Aside from balancing Persona fusion benefits, this benefits from more options to prioritize when anyone appears during lunchtime or asks for a Sunday date for guaranteed rank ups. I do prioritize girls I'm dating so I can move on to date another once they're maxed.\n+ Persona-wise, I effectively fuse everything. I care first about covering at least one of each elemental affinity for One More! attacks (Agi, Bufu, Zio, Garu), a party heal (Cadenza or Media), and in later game, defense debuffs and attack buffs (Rakunda, Tarukaja); and second their Persona level.\n+ Party-wise, I focused on the following instead of leveling them all up: Yukari, Akihiko, and Mitsuru. This party has heals as well as an elemental affinity for each party member. Exploiting elemental instead of physical attacks is the game's meta. I prefer sticking with one party when posssible because this means less grinding.\n\nI sometimes used PCSX2's save/load state if I find the save points too sparse and frustrating if I die. However, I never used it as a crutch for riskier gameplay except for frustrating difficulty spikes (see Sleeping Table).",

    "date_started": "10/9/20",
    "date_finished": "10/15/20",
    "comments": "Divinity is one of the best RPGs this decade, standing out as the modern CRPG while other RPG titans are western RPGs (e.g., Elder Scrolls) and JRPGs (e.g., Persona 5). It leverages standard CRPG elements, excelling most in its deep turn-based environmental combat and build variety.\n\nFlaw-wise, there are a few. First, Source Skills/Points are the only bad new mechanic, introducing a consumable that can either be replenished too often making fights too easy or too rarely used. Second, like Divinity 1, the story never reaches the worldbuilding and character depth of, say, Witcher 3. Third, Divinity 2 has a weird culture of save scumming, at times discouraging it (otherwise what's the purpose of accuracy as a mechanic?) and other times encouraging it, where it's hard to get through a fight without reloading to optimize for pre-fight shenanigans like positioning; or in dialogue options. Fourth, I find CRPGs outstay their welcome in slowly becoming repetitive and closer to a chore to finish. Fortunately, I think Divinity 2 compensated for this better than other RPGs by having an engaging endgame, so I kept looking forward to gear/skill upgrades and testing it out in the next battle. Divinity's many town and puzzle quests are not interesting to me though.\n\n__Story.__ I like the character origin stories as well as the various quests. The overarching story with Sourcerers is forgettable; like Divinity 1, it reminds me of a generic D&D campaign. I skimmed the dialogue to proceed more quickly to combat.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The core gameplay loop follows Divinity 1 with notable elements such as a transparent turn order; high difficulty; emphasis on elemental combos; crowd control and buffs over traditional tanking, and positioning; and seamless integration of free roam and combat. Progression and party-composition-wise, it's core comprises companions; attributes, skills; consumables like scrolls; inventory management. Story/level-wise, it's core comprises quests and side quests. As a CRPG, Divinity 2 stands out from other RPG subgenres in its isometric camera angle; flexibility of controls, with options such as thievery, attacking NPCs, teleporting/attacking your own party, and pet pal unlocking optional dialogue; emergent gamplay from its many abilities (see a larger list in my Divinity 1 entry); D&D combat system; non-obvious quest objectives.\n\nDivinity 2 features several new additions to the series. The armor system adds more depth to focusing, e.g., mages vs knights with physical vs magic attacks. Source skills offer powerful, consumable-like spells which I despise; it's clearly inspired by tabletop game's attrition mechanic that encourages care around resource consumption over multiple battles. Tags replace attitudes that depend on specific dialogue choices; I like this simpler approach of defining you a priori rather than dynamically and being careful of what you say. New to character creation are Origin Story characters, enabling the flexibility of custom heroes but with the freedom of adapting to a well-written character story. Divinity 2's entrance barrier is also a bit lower as you only have to create one character, creating the other three party members soon but not immediately. Crafting and durability is streamlined, with only weapons taking durability and does not require blacksmith skills for crafting/repair. I'm not sure how I feel about this streamlining, but I do like that in Divinity 2, civil abilities are separate from combat abilities, enabling party members to each specialize in a civil role without requiring an HM-like mule as in Divinity 1. Endgame gear now includes runes, frames for runes, and Eternal Aeterfact enhancements.\n\nUnlike Divinity 1, Divinity 2 doesn't have a weird meta where low-cost skills like low-rank melee CCs and summons are easily achievable, so there isn't an encouragement of hybrid builds for each character. Divinity 2's memory stat also avoids having 3-4 skillbars worth of spells for each character. And thank god there's less meta reliance on consumables like elemental grenades and arrows, and a ranger that manages elemental arrow consumables. Consumables may be more minmax, but they require tedious inventory micromanagement. Unfortunately, Divinity 2's meta is a race to strip armor from an enemy in order to CC it: this means DPS, initiative, initial positioning, high AP, and mobility are king. This improves upon Divinity 1's immediate CC and environmental effects taking hold, but still feels somewhat shallow as a mechanic ruining build diversity.\n\nProgression-wise, I would spend hours upon entrance to a new town, overrun with new quests and feeling slightly overwhelmed in traying to coomplete them all while not forgetting to talk to someone or miss a potentially important quest. This, combined with the inventory management, skill management, and overall party composition, makes the game feel overwhelming at times. I have this feeling in all CRPGs. Other RPGs like Witcher and Elder Scrolls can also be occasionally overwhelming in the amount of quests pursued simultaneously; and JRPGs can be occasionally overwhelming in party management. However, CRPGs do both.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Honestly looks exactly like Divinity Enhanced Edition.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ You can respec. You also don't forget learned skills when respeccing. You just can't use them until you meet the requirements.\n+ If you scroll up during a conversation you can see the conversation history. I don't recall if this was also in Divinity 1.\n+ You can see NPC/enemy sight range by holding Left Shift. This is helpful for sneaking or illegal activity.\n+ Unlike Divinity 1, you can immediately see everyone's inventory. No context switching.\n+ Unlike Divinity 1 but like Divinity 1 Enhanced Edition, party members dead during fight still gain XP.\n+ You can mark items in your inventory for auto-sell.\n+ Unlike Divinity 1, you can now Examine enemies to see more details such as highlighting status effects to see their descriptions, or their immunities.\n+ Skill bar is almost twice as long as it was in Divinity 1.\n+ Unlike Divinity 1, Divinity 2 is a bit more transparent about the effect of a trader's attitude toward each party member. It's not based on the conversation initiator but which party member is buying/selling.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ You can now fast travel from the main menu. You don't have to go back to a waypoint like in Divinity 1.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ As with Divinity 1, there's always a meta where the path to killing everyone rewards more XP than the dialogue-only route. Sometimes it's even worse where the optimal XP route is passivity followed by killing after the quest ends.\n+ Source points mechanic. Source points require zero usage or otherwise tedious back-and-forth between a Source Fountain and the original area; teleport pyramids help with this but at that point it's OP if used every battle. Midgame I only used it for quests and endgame I maybe used it too often since the endgame skills all use it and you would otherwise get it stolen from you.\n+ The quest pathing in Act 2 is confusing. Without a level map, you quickly run into areas you're outlevelled, not knowing whether to stay the course or quit to find another area.\n+ Weirdly, weapon skills are additive while general skills are multiplicative. This means Warfare is a greater DPS increase than upgrading weapon skills even though weapon skills is more specialized.\n+ Getting close to a Shrieker for Source Vampirism is just annoying. Would be frustrating without Chameleon Cloak.\n+ You can't use a Teleporter Pyramid to or from the boat. For example, you can't easily teleport to the respec mirror.\n+ I wish it were more obvious which vendors sold which skillbook schools. For example, the minimap tracker in World of Warcraft.\n+ Final fight and Death Room are not well-designed. In the final fight, the boss always gets the initiative and teleports you to the front, so you lose any positioning power. You're immediately put in a recovery position and it's hard to recover.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://fextralife.com/divinity-original-sin-2-party-combinations-guide-magic-physical-and-mixed/ | I like the fextralife guides because they cater to a class fantasy, providing general ideas. Sin Tee's builds provides further details on what's most viable from an optimization perspective.\n+ sin tee | https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1139237003\n+ areas by level | https://divinityoriginalsin2.vidyawiki.com/Areas+By+Level\n+ sworn pros and cons | https://www.reddit.com/r/DivinityOriginalSin/comments/bkkdj1/everything_i_know_about_being_sworn\n\nI played on Classic for my first playthrough. As with other RPGs, my favored approach in Divinity 2 is to only use guides for character building/mechanics and to play blind in terms of quest pathing. I can be completionist and minmax on a second playthrough when I play Tactician or Honor mode. I have the following open when playing: all 4 builds, Area by level tab for general direction; and Vim for editing this entry as well as a skillbook list of things I need.\n\nMy party is:\n\n+ 2H warrior/berserker. Lizard male (Red Prince) with Oud. Also serves as Persuasian with Pet Pal talent, Bartering, and shovel digger.\n+ Wizard in Pyromancy and Geomancy. Human female (Lohse) with Tambura. Talents include Glass cannon. Also serves as Loremaster and has the unique Summon Inner Demon skill.\n+ Ranger. Elf female (Sebille) with Bansuri. Talents include Glass cannon. Also serves as Lucky Charm and corpse eater for memories.\n+ Necromancer. Undead human male (Fane; my main character) with Cello. Talents include Glass cannon. Also serves as thievery since undeads don't need lockpicks and is given Sworn with two new talents Torturer and All Skilled Up followed by applying Swornbreaker.\n\nOverall, this party balances physical and magic; and melee and ranged. Ideally, the leading character is the melee frontrunner, has Persuasian and Pet Pal, and is the main character; this satisfies most any dialogue requirements. Each uses Sin Tee's guide as the starting point and varies a bit to cater to my playstyle (see my October 14 journal entry; the only non-minor increment was adding more CC utility on the Wizard and Necromancer). The 2H berserker is my spin on a traditional tank role, but played more toward aggression to fit Divinity's aggressive and CC playstyle over MMOs. The wizard and ranger are classic ranged DPS, playing to Divinity's encouragement of ranged to avoid elemental environments around enemies, AoE attacks, and leveraging the wizard to dip lightly into some schools to exploit such environments. The necromancer plays even further into Divinity's specialties; a thief role is not as powerful as a ranger role, and necromancers can summon for early game and stay ranged. For origin stories, I tried to fit best to the four archetypes while also experiencing the best content.",

    "comments": "Braid helped launch the success of the indie scene as a viable business strategy. As a standalone game, Braid stands out in its platforming innovation of time travel as a core mechanic. Braid clearly attests to indie standards: a clear directorial vision, minimal core controls, budget yet artistic graphics.\n\n__Story.__ Some exposition dumps at the beginning of each world as a sort of reward. THe prose is actually quite good and works well with the soundtrack. I found this balanced mystery/intrigue and depth.\n\nBraid's overall message is too purposefully obfuscated, leaning to pretention. The biggest pretention is the hackneyed core analogy to the Atom bomb, where scientists are so intrigued by the scientific challenges that they're horrified of what they eventually made, not considering long-term impact. I think this is an overly romanticized cliche about technology. However, I still like its core theme of obsession and how the overarching story wrapped around it. The game is clearly auteristic in demonstrating Jonathan Blow's vision of what a video game should be: adult, presenting themes he's passionate about, and having it all conveyed by video game mechanics. I wish the core gameplay loop with individual levels connected better to this overall story. Otherwise it's only the mechanic that lasts, not the levels themselves.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Braid's biggest innovation is time. It balances being a challenging platformer while also very forgiving with the ability to retry according to time. Health and lives are also overhauled by this excellent mechanic. Time travel is infinite up to the area, not based on a cooldown or limited. Each world has different time travel mechanics. As an example of depth, you can even use the speed multiplier to pause time. This is helpful for enabling the green items to still move while the world is paused such as any obstacles. World 1 blowing minds with its time reversal and its reversed music. And the ending that you discover by reversing time one last time.\n\nCore controls and enemies are strongly inspired by Mario. It has a decent amount of puzzles to complement the platforming, more than I would like so I often resorted to walkthroughs as I can't stand puzzle games. Puzzles aren't my thing, but I can appreciate the expanded depth on the same mechanic.\n\nThe game makes a fantastic use of asset reuse, reusing certain levels to emphasize certain ideas, using familiarity with the pre-existing puzzle solutions as the building block. This isn't done for lazy asset reuse to save production time/costs, but to build on player knowledge.\n\nFailures in this game are truly the video game version of ground hog day, with a finer controlled form of it.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Love the soundtrack. The indie art style clearly ages well.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Fast travel is immediate, allowing you to easily enter a specific level in each world.\n+ It doesn't support borderless out of the box, but it does support arbitrary resolution unlike many pixel indie platformers; and it wasn't difficult to get Borderless Gaming to work with it.\n_ The amount of puzzles per level followed by arranging a puzzle makes for good pacing.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Certain actions are completely irreversible, making you restart the entire game to complete it.. (level 3-6). Fortunately they just unlock a different ending, so they don't black content. I believe level 3-6 is the only one that locks you out.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ guide | https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Braid, https://braid.fandom.com\n\nMotivated to play after a recent indie/roguelike marathon I got into in September 2020 with Undermine, Binding of Isaac, and Spelunky.",

    "comments": "Crash Bandicoot is iconic. Creative level designs, diverse bosses, characters and art, surprisingly challenging (and mostly fair; especially Crash 1 being the most difficult), and minimal core controls. Crash 3 remains my favorite as the first I played in the series and which I still remember in 2020 trying to Gold relic certain levels and their soundtrack: Toad Village (though I remembered the first level across all three games), Orient Express, Area 51, High Time, scuba mission. I can see why the fan favorite is slightly more on Crash 2, which had the most innovations from entry to the next, had a great balance of difficulty and accessibility, and didn't suffer from too many vehicle missions. Depth perception with its fixed camera angle, the need for trial and error on some platforming (both of which are especially most comomn in Crash 1), and too many vehicle levels in Crash 3, are its flaws.\n\n__Story.__ Typically damsel in distress. The first game was the weirdest in having an almost sexualized girlfriend you were saving. Crash 2 and 3 were tamer in introducing Coco and further building on Neo Cortex.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The Crash trilogy stands out as a pinnacle of the 3D platforming genre just as it were transitioning from 2D with related games like Spyro and Super Mario 64. Levels feature excellent platforming with simple core controls and a short and sweet time to complete (roughly 2-3 minutes). In Crash 1, this is jump and spin. Because there are no movement speed moves, Crash 1 focuses most on precise platforming. Currency of fruits for lives that restart a level of checkpoints when run out is simple and works well. Aku is the only health shared across levels, along with lives, and it's minimal but a quality-of-life in the ability to assist for other levels: you don't feel this is overpowered or necessary in order to go through a level. Levels are diverse, with numerous platforming challenges. Time trial further adds replayability and challenge.\n\nCrash 2 introduces several core controls which feel like they should have been there all along: crouch (for high jump), slide as an attack and platforming move, ground pound, and some power-ups like Speedy Shoes. Platforming-wise, Crash 2 introduces the iconic Nitro box and the Nitro switch box, ice, different requirements for gems, surfing, secret warp rooms, underground mole movement. Crash 2 is also easier than Crash 1, without as many unfair platforming sections, while still remaining challenging.\n\nCrash 3 introduces a few power-ups as you progress such as double jump, longer spin, and fruit bazooka. It goes most ambitious of all games in diverse level designs with time travel as the theme: medieval, mesozoic era, egyptian, futuristic, 1950s. It also has more vehicles and introduces Coco as a playable character. Not many platforming changes: spinning crates with change in reward. Crash 3 goes most in accessibility, being the easiest.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The revitalized graphics look gorgeous and retains its cartoon style. Some of the graphics look so real that I can't believe this is 2017 and not 2020. Honestly it feels too real for the art style. A nostalgic soundtrack. This is one of the few games where a game-directed camera angle works really well. The depth perception for some of the platforming though... is still memorably bad.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Since Crash Bandicoot 1, Bonus Rounds effectively serve as mini-levels, not costing lives and which you can start over immediately after failing.\n+ Aku health starts coming automatically if you repeatedly die. Not necessary but a nice quality-of-life improvement to assist with a level you're stuck on.\n+ Crystals introduced since Crash 2 are a great way of marking progress across levels; diamonds are also less forgiving in that they're about crate completion or other secrets, and no longer require not dying in the level.\n+ Since Crash 2, you can enter individual levels in an area at your own order.\n+ In N. Sane Trilogy, you can swap to play as Coco. This is clearly the start of cosmetic skins and playable characters that Crash 4 further expands on.\n+ Checkpoints are boxes you must hit instead of auto-checkpoints. Aside from appealing further to Crash's theme, the checkpoints also serve some depth, e.g., in deciding when to avoid them or to hit certain boxes before you decide to \"save\" with the checkpoint.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ To replace the challenge of getting gems in Crash 1, where you must collect all crates and not die once, there are Death Routes starting in Crash 2.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Frame rate options are atrocious, being a multiplier of your monitor's refresh rate: for my 144hz, this is 30 and 48 FPS. I can do a hack with Alt+Enter in windowed mode to unlock FPS, but this forces me to use fullscreen mode instead of borderless.\n+ In Crash Bandicoot 1, you can't easily restart a level. You have to quit to enter the hub traversal then re-enter the level which is two loading screens and animations.\n+ Some levels are infuriating: Native Fortress with its vertical platforming that failing restarts the whole thing. Road to Nowhere is notoriously hard but at least it has fast replayability not relying on patience but precise execution; and similarly, High Road's jumping off turtles and its imprecise controls (hold Jump to jump higher, not timing it; run while falling from prior jump to do a running jump; https://www.reddit.com/r/crashbandicoot/comments/6kgrw8/jumping_and_jumping_of_turtles, https://www.reddit.com/r/crashbandicoot/comments/6l1awk/high_road_jumping_tips_from_a_not_experienced). It's not even fun because it's bad controls. Another difficult duo are Slippery Climb and Stormy Ascent. I had to farm to get 8 instead of starting with 4 lives for Stormy Ascent. Stormy Ascent is the one I spent hours on. I did experience several game overs grinding certain levels in Crash 2 (especially Ruination), but none were to an extent of Crash 1 levels with the exception of Spaced Out.\n+ Maybe 20 years later, I still remember Crash 3's underwater levels and hating them. Getting all crates in the waterskating levels is also pretty bad.\n+ I'm not sure how I feel about Crash 3's double jump.

It's not necessary in almost all of the platforming sections and gives a bit more leeway than the precision of a single jump.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nMotivated to play since Crash Bandicoot 4 just came out. Similar to Spelunky, I played Crash Bandicoot somewhat casually while watching Twitch streams. Platformers are really good video games that aren't timed or require too much concentration that you can casually watch something while you do it. I completed all levels in the Crash Trilogy, including the two DLC with Stormy Ascent and Future Tense, but with the exception of secret levels in Crash 2 and Crash 3.",

    "comments": "It's fun as a fast-paced linear coop shooter, with players able to jump in at any point. Enemies, level designs, weapon variety, and tight core controls keep the game replayable. It gets repetitive after a few games, but I still find it quite fun to pick up once in a while. Very low barrier to entry.\n\n__Story.__ A loose string of standalone campaigns. Basically nonexistent.\n\n__Gameplay.__ I always thought the game was a zombie defense. Turns out it's an awesome linear shooter moving from safe house to safe house rife with zombies. The linearity gives variety in environments. It's constantly fast-paced, encouraged to keep you move, and with various mechanics encouraging cooperative play. The variety of special zombies keeps the game on your toes. I love that the characters each provide audio cues, suggesting items to pick up, areas to go to, etc. Keeps the game feeling alive.\n\nL4D2 was an interesting time for coop shooters: no aim down sights with slower movement speed; no movement penalty on strafe or backpedal; no sprint with a stamina bar; and infinite secondary weapon ammo. Floaty acceleration based movement with strafing and backpedaling not that much of a movement speed penalty. This encourages a nice run and gun playstyle as opposed to the tactical style that Call of Duty popularized later. This style ages surprisingly well, holding up even in 2021.\n\nThe difficulty grades add increasing levels of challenge as you master the game under different playstyles, position and manage your ammo, and how to handle the special zombies. Playstyles include machine gunner, shotgunner, sniper, and supporting role (e.g., medic).\n\nThe versus game mode where you can play campaigns as the zombie elevates the game at an even higher bar of replayability. Matchmaking for PvP is awful however as quick matches drop you into losing matches. There's no skill-based match making.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Surprisingly aged well playing in 2020 with a nice horror movie aesthetic. The level design has great variety, and with a good use of both lighting and sound design. The audio cues to signal the presence of enemy specials, especially when they're not in your POV, is excellent.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ The satisfying feeling of shooting all zombies from the safety of the safe house.\n+ All the visual effects such as the acid obscured vision and when you pop adrenaline.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Revisiting L4D2 after playing Back 4 Blood, there are a few things that Left 4 Dead 2 is missing. The only major one is a lack of ping to spot special enemies or any other notable area. The Z and X communication tools could be greatly simplified and also be part of the HUD and not just the character's voice. Another is an explicit timer for when horde arrives so you can spend the time to find a good position before it starts instead of continuing to run. B4B also adds more items, weapons, enemies.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nFor the first time in years, Left 4 Dead 2 came with an update for The Last Stand this weekend, leading to a peak of 100K concurrent players and 50K on average. I don't even care about the expansion per se; it's great to just see the online scene populate again, similar to what Warcraft 3 Reforged did. This made an excellent time to start playing the game having missed the hype almost a decade ago. Like any online play, I tried to play the campaigns in rough order, selecting lobbies based on campaigns I haven't started yet to maximize completing missing content. I typically played Normal difficulty.",

    "comments": "Spelunky is the highlight of mainstream indie roguelites along with Binding of Isaac, FTL, and Rogue Legacy giving rise to the subgenre. It executes well a concept of combining roguelike and platformer elements, paired with great controls, enemy variety, and level design. I find it a perfect game to play while watching a Twitch stream, listening to a movie, or grinding a TV series, and it's easy to pick up and replay.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Spelunky is an excellent roguelite building on elements from platformers. It encourages core concepts: deliberate decision-making, emergent gameplay with universally applicable controls/items, and resource conservation. For example, bombs assist both in platforming and damage; traps can be used to kill not only yourself but also enemies.\n\nAnother memorable component in Spelunky is its many instant death scenarios, unforgiving with certain platforming and enemies. In addition, a ghost spawns after 2.5 minutes every level, ultimately giving a balance of tension to move quickly and cautiousness to not trigger traps. Core controls are also excellent: sprint, rope and bomb, attack, jump with ledge hanging. Emergent gameplay arises exponentially from the universality in controls, with a good set of tools, enemy variety, and level variety.\n\nLike true roguelikes, there is no real progression across games. The one exception are shortcuts, which help casual playthroughs beat the game. They are also a fantastic way of getting used to new areas without having to grind older areas only to die immediately.\n\nThe game is challenging in its unforgiving attitude. Like Dark Souls, you feel responsible for each death and truly do learn from each failure: enemy movesets, platforming traps (an iconic instant death scenario that's totally your fault), improved resource management.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Cartoon graphics are timeless. I love the expressions on all the characters and death animations: dark humor at its finest. Music is also excellent.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Quickstart option to immediately get to playing once you launch the game.\n+ The Damsel as the approach to gaining life. It's not just a health consumable!\n+ The iconic stealing of items from the item shop followed by running away from wrath of the shopkeeper.\n+ The many instant deaths, e.g., spikes, tiki traps, arrow traps.\n+ Runs feeling like half an hour when only minutes have gone by each level.\n+ All the advanced player techniques: whipping arrow traps, timing bombs to hit locations mid trajectory, landing on enemies or ledge grabbing to avoid fall damage, enemy hopping, bounce on water, [ledge grab for height-constrained gap jumps](https://reddit.com/r/spelunky/comments/1n3l62/advanced_tricks_gif_guide/).\n+ The nonlinear difficulty curve. The Jungle easily has the biggest difficulty spike. I like the change in pace with the Snow area. Once I completed the Jungle, I felt comfortable with a handle over the entire game. The Mine and Snow both felt so much easier after the Jungle. The Snow shortcut requiring a Key from the Mine also encourages the shortcut-only playthrough to also master at least the route from Mines to Snow.\n+ Specific memory: Finally unlocking the Door for the final shortcut, bringing the Key to the Mine after 22.3 hours in Spelunky. I got to the third area 5-7 times; a few deaths were absolutely RNG.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Characters are just cosmetic.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ You can't save progress in the middle of a run.\n+ Multiplayer is only local.\n+ I wish Spelunky kept a detailed stat chart of your rin history, so you can tell what you die most to, etc. Similar to ladder video games' stats.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://spelunky.fandom.com\n\nI played the HD version. Apparently RMNDolphy really likes this lol. As of the finished date, I only beat Olmec through shortcuts. I didn't beat Olmec from a full playthrough, or reach Hell. I'll leave this for revisiting playthroughs.",

Mafia most stands out in its story and polished presentation. Although not quite at the level of storytelling of its inspirations, Mafia still makes for a compelling 10-hour game as you adventure through Tommy's life. Gameplay elements are okay but get stale halfway through the game.\n\n__Story.__ The story is Mafia's most stellar aspect, truly feeling as polished as a gangster film. It clearly takes inspiration from Goodfellas and The Godfather. The characters stand out in their motivations. The in medias res feels unnecessary but works to provide narration. They're some characterization, particularly in the beginning, that works well. The novelty fades away however, and there isn't much more to substantiate Tommy's partner Sarah, his relationships with Paulie or Sam, or himself. You don't see much really driving the story forward except for the main plot element which is arguably less exciting than what the beginning offered in introducing the world-building and characters. Also kind of dumb that Tommy is the best driver, shooter, and money-maker in the gang.. mafias benefit from an ensemble cast and I wish Mafia benefited from delving more into supporting characters like Ralphie and Frank.\n\nThe Paulie death is heart-wrenching and played well to his misery although not unexpected given the stereotype of his character in other mob films. I think my biggest annoyance is that Tom decides to rob a bank just as an approach to cheer up his fellow brother. That seems so weird.. The underlying motivations from typical films of getting money to live a comfortable life and retire isn't as meaningful here because money isn't really mentioned; you sort of just assume everyone is well off once they're made men. Sam's motivation seems really weird too.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Third-person with basic controls for movement, driving, basic platforming, and shooting. The beat-em-up parts are pretty boring: dodge then hit combo. Roughly forgettable.\n\nLevel design is an open world like Arkham, Grand Theft Auto, or Yakuza. Interestingly, unlike any of those games, the city is devoid of any activity and is mostly just a setting for the linear quests. I think this is fine: no need for side quests and miscellaneous jobs.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Graphics are gorgeous. Soundtrack is truly cinematic.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ You can turn on a speed limiter while driving. Lets you avoid driving like a madman.\n+ You can pause cutscenes. Increasingly more common, but good to have it such a cutscene-heavy game. Otherwise accidentally hitting a button and skipping, or not being able to multi-task, sucks.\n+ Cars in your garage will always be there even if you park it elsewhere. This is a nice qualify of life feature for a streamlined game like this.\n+ It's clear this game is a remake rather than original IP because of how few AAA stereotypes are the ingame: skill trees, upgrades, or equipment; there are still some collectibles and really basic stealth.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ You have both a minimap, map in the menu, and on-screen directions. I would prefer the minimap to not exist at all for maximal immersion. There aren't even options to alter HUD.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nMotivated to play as it's story-driven and seems like a fun linear, cinematic action-adventure. Adds some variety after my recent marathon of roguelikes. I played on Medium difficulty and 3/4 into the game while doing the climax to Morello I swapped to Easy difficulty; I don't have the patience for the combat. The game seems most designed for controller so I went with that.",

The game is fast-paced enough room-by-room, and generally forgiving (at least in Normal difficulty) that it doesn't feel frustrating. There are also no progression mechanics like stat upgrades, only character and ending unlocks, so you're not forced to grind. I generally find the bullet hell genre to be fairly stale as you just point in a direction and dodge projectiles; and Binding of Isaac is the exception that I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Upgrades come in the form of active items, passive collectibles, unique trinket, cards, and pickups like health, currency, and bombs. Room-by-room completion with a boss per level. Core gameplay is inevitably a bullet hell but it features enough variety that it's not _just_ a bullet hell.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Ages well. It's a shame that it doesn't render natively to resolutions, subscribing to a fixed one..\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Having the most fun when the game is effectively broken with an enormously overpowered character: fast tear shots, max damage, and ridiculous movement speed.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Stacked item mechanics affect your character's appearance.\n+ Rebirth's analog controls with a controller are so much better for movement and aiming than mouse and keyboard.\n+ Hard difficulty isn't an enemy damage and HP scaling, instead making mechanics like curse more prominent (https://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/Hard_mode).\n+ You can't save in the middle of a session, but you can in Rebirth. It helps that games are roughly 20 minutes total, but still.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Default aim controls are four directions without any diagonal. This makes shooting less flexible focusing even more on movement.\n+ Pixel resolution is surprisingly bad for a remake..\n+ In the options, you only see a thumbnail of all items you stacked. You can highlight them to see more details like in Risk of Rain 2.\n+ Item and card mechanics are poorly explained.\n+ You need to beat the game 12 times to get to the true endgame.

From then on, I installed the two DLCs Afterbirth and Afterbirth+. I tried playing Hard mode and felt with more hours I could get used to it.

I also wish there were more artifacts to enable stacking (there is little, at least up to Delvemore), and more bosses per location..\n\n__Story.__ Effectievly nonexistent, but I like the minimal context. Each try is a new peasant miner, and it's basically man labor thrown at the unknown to discover the cause of the tremors.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Roguelite progression mechanics. Core gameplay loop is great. Artifacts are what enable the emergent gameplay as they stack over levels. Levels follow the roguelike strategy of cell-by-cell, analogous to Binding of Isaac and Darkest Dungeon.

The art style feels timeless.\n\nPacing, however, may not be its strength in my opinion. It may just be me, but the game lacks a real sense of progression, even within chapters that I would expect for the slowest pace slices-of-life like Aria or Haibane Renmei. I don't enjoy this visual novel as much as I could.\n\n__Story.__ I think the premise of the story of a coffee shop as a medium between the recently departed moving from living to the afterlife is an interesting one. It reminds me of Koreeda's After Life (1998) film. Awkwardly when I first played this, I thought it would be a thriller with its necromancy/after life elements and opening scene. Boy was I wrong: it's a drama! Comedic timing and moment to moment dialogue is typically wonderful.\n\nPacing is not Necrobarista's strength. It sort of wanders without a clear sense of purpose. The choice of the story effectively representing a purgatory makes this aimlessness reasonable lore-wise. But it doesn't make up for the story not feeling fun to read. The prologue didn't super excite me enough to feel okay with blasting through to continue. I just don't get a sense of why the chapters keep on progressing. There's a cafe with a debt. And some patrons just lounging about, with one who recently came after he died. In one chapter there's a visitor to the cafe that you build some rapport with in a conversation. Then it happens again. Then again. But why? Even Aria and other slices of life have conflicts that are resolved per episode, so there is a notion of progression.\n\nCharacters are all pretty distinctive in their own personalities. Setting lacks variety, with it all happening in the cafe, and any notion of time passing by (e.g., morning, afternoon, night); this make the scenes feel a bit static. In typical \"no plot\" anime, you can still get a grasp of a character's day-to-day life. That helps I think.\n\n__Gameplay.__ I had no idea what I was doing when selecting words in Act I. I'm not sure how I feel about the RNG in collectibles to go into mini-side stories. It feels like artificial gamey-ness as an alternative to selecting routes in a traditional visual novel.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ I like the art style. It ages well. The way the text appears dynamically also makes the game feel significantly more polished than typical visual novels, almost to the point of being an actual animated game if it had both voice acting and real animation between what are effectively \"key frames\". The soundtrack is also fun, albeit repetitive.\n\nSurprised at the elements where I can actually move around like a first-person game! And I thought this was purely a visual novel.\n\nDetails I like:\n\nThe three leg guys commenting inbetween chapters.

It doesn't necessarily stand out in any of these elements, and it's a fun hack-and-slash when one's in the mood for more Doom/Wolfenstein gameplay.\n\n__Story.__ Lo Wang's quips add to the charm of this Asian-influenced comedic action. The story is somewhere between a Hollywood blockbuster and a B-rated martial arts films.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Core gameplay loop is fun with decent enemy variety, an arsenal of weapons, and diverse moveset variety for your katana. I'm not a huge fan of the array of fighting move-style movesets per weapon, as I'm a big proponent of simple fundamentals that work and extend well. For example, in Shadow Warrior (2013), the shurikens, multiple sword Ki moves, Demon Heads, Shockwave, and Protection skill trees are useless. There's no incentive in the game to utilize the full diversity. Maybe it was just normal difficulty speaking, but I often was just spamming the Katana attack.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Forgettable. Love the gore. Environment variety in levels is decent but the asset reuse is still noticeable.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ You can use your left hand simultaneously with your right, e.g., attack while healing or casting Flux.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ For an arcade-like game, it would benefit from clearer waypoints to guide mission objectives. I would frequently find myself lost, which is okay for a Doom game which plops you into a level, but not in a linear game liek Shadow Warrior (2013).\n+ Like Doom (2016), the game should track the number of secrets and ki crystals during the mission, not after the mission when you have to backtrack or otherwise carefully follow a walkthrough to 100% in the first run.\n+ It's not exactly clear how Karma currency translates to Karma points to spend in the skill tree.\n+ I wish the precision and variety of melee attacks follows that of Chivalry, not flashy moves that are often not viable.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ build | https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=207578456\n\nI played on normal difficulty, playing more for the power fantasy than a challenge. I just played blind to enjoy mindless gameplay. I primarily used the Katana, and situationally the Zi-Type Pow for ranged enemies and bosses, Shotgun for shield enemies, and Flux when overwhelmed. I never used Revolver, Crossbow, or Flamethrower.",

    "comments": "This game preserves the intensity of Doom games, particularly Doom (2016) and Doom Eternal. It has a handful of simple, well-purposed weapons alongside unique enemy types and bosses. The unlimited ammo and lack of reloading makes the game focus even more on the gunplay as there's less resource management with just health and stamina. Quake graphics. Boss battles are more frequent than Doom (which is great), and much more epic. Core mechanics are Doom-like: no sprint, dash, no reload, keys.\n\nThe game's opener with the music and presentation of HUD is excellent.\n\nMy only nit is that the weapons, and enemy types, don't encourage weapon swapping as much as Doom and Doom Eternal do. There is some incentive, but it's mostly based on current distance to enemy as well as cooldowns such as the pistol's chargeshot. Soundtrack is also somewhat stale mid to end game. Something also feels off with the shotgun. I would rather the railgun do less damage and be off cooldown, acting similar to Doom's Gauss Cannon.",

Mid to endgame is stale.\n\n__Story.__ Forgettable and I didn't even bother to read the text a few hours in.\n\n__Gameplay.__  Most unique to Torchlight is the pet, which is a significant quality of life improvement for carrying loot and going back to town to sell them. Otherwise, however, Torchlight features standard ARPG elements coming from the mainstream that Diablo popularized: build-wise (mouse and action keys, inventory, stash, skill trees); HUD; enemy-wise; and quest structure (including identify and portal scrolls). It even has enchant, gems, transmutation, potion spam in heal over time and no cooldown, and waypoints. It's more streamlined than Diablo, without any durability, Diablo 2-style hubs with environment variety rather than a single large dungeon, and fewer character and item stats. Enemy variety and affinities on elites aren't as deep as Diablo 2.\n\nFame gives you extra skill points. Phase portals are rare spawns offering unique challenges. Whether they're fair in their limited corridors and massive amount of enemies is another thing. Map scrolls are one-off instances like Diablo's.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Blasting tons of enemies with Ember Lighting, my main spell. It's like Arc Elementalist from PoE all over again! It can even break LOS. Of course, it pales to the fast movement speed, fast cast speed, and AoE blow-up side effects that make the Arc Elementalist build so fun at endgame.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Left click to move item, right click to equip, shift left click to move to the next window, e.g., merchant or pet. You don't even have to open the pet window to shift left click to transfer items to the pet! You can't split item stacks though.\n+ You auto-pickup gold when you walk over it.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ There are multiple resurrect options instead of always incurring the XP and gold penalty.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ No borderless. I used Borderless Gaming and windowed setting which fortunately worked fine.\n+ No town healer.\n+ No respec options.\n+ Surprisingly, there are very few quests, with primarily just four questgivers following a formula throughout the game: Valeria's quests are main quest; Gar's quests are retrieval; Scholar's quests are ember retrieval; Hatch's quests are isolated portal dungeons.\n+ Ember sidequests don't tell you the level they're at. Without a guide, you can easily miss it and therefore the full quest chain.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://torchlight.fandom.com\n+ alchemist build | https://slashnblast.wordpress.com/2011/09/12/new-torchlight-1-build-arcane-alchemist\n\nFirst motivated to play in 05/2020 after really enjoying the Borderlands' class progression and RNG loot mechanics, which takes inspiration from ARPGs. Having already played Diablo and Path of Exile, I'd love to see Torchlight's approach to this. Thinking back to Freshman year at Berkeley, I wonder if this is the Torchlight that Justin(?) was playing in the dorms. It was Fall 2010 so it seems likely as Torchlight 2 is 2011. With that said, the game does not advance anything interesting however, so Grim Dawn seems like a better third option to Diablo and Path of Exile than delving into Torchlight, which especially took a bad reputation with Torchlight 3 (https://www.reddit.com/r/ARPG/comments/du5gv7/big_list_of_arpgs).\n\nPlaying the game, I was ultimately motivated from Sodapoppin after seeing him play Chronicron and RPing Flamewrath, a fire mage; that ARPG seems worse than others that I may as well play. There aren't many builds online, and I admire Soda's bravery to just dive straight into an RPG without research, instead learning on the way and allocating to builds based on the class fantasy. So I did that. I played on Hard difficulty as it is recommended to ARPG experts. I played Alchemist and allocated stats/skill points somewhat freely, although I did look at guides as I started accumulating them to make sure I was going generally in the right direction.\n\nAt Floor 31, I was triggered by being spawn camped and losing all my gold trying to kill the skeletons around me. Around Floor 30 I just felt the game felt too spongey with my damage taking 3-4 hits per enemy and me dying as a glass cannon. So I just decided to use cheats, turning on god and speed mode among others. The Dark Zealot guys are instant difficulty spike with their poison homing bolts being a one-shot-kill.",

    "comments": "Excellent core mechanics for a turn-based medieval roguelike, with high difficulty with every battle mattering, item and level progression, and decent worlds for navigation. I have mixed feelings about the timed turns, forcing you to micromanage every decision you make particularly at the higher difficulties.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Roguelike with replayability due to random level generation, several campaigns, and unlockable assets (classes, encounters, locations, items). I like the RPG elements building on Dungeons and Dragons, with classes, high RNG, damage types, status effects, and basic equipment management. Difficulty is also quite high, with Chaos and Scourge as excellent mechanics to make each turn be deliberate during navigation and the displayed turn order to make turns be deliberate during combat. Focus mechanic is excellent for resource management. Damage formulas are transparent with enemies displaying their physical and magic armor as well as status immunities.\n\nBecause the difficulty is so high, the game unfortunately focuses a little too much on micromanaging turns and the many consumables. There's an optimal path and the game often tunnel visions you into it with less build variety. For example: optimizing buying Godsbeard as they're limited to 3/shop and Tinder Pouches, not buying most equipment as it's easier to pick them up, almost always going for Reduce Chaos in sidequests.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ I like the mesh-textured artwork. It ages well for an indie game.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ The perilousness of combat. You can die easily. Items including equipped ones can be destroyed. Certain status effects like poison persist after battle. Items can be stolen.\n+ The occassionally hilarious way enemies topple over and die.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ You can save scum in this game. This matters especially because a specific turn or RNG can screw you over, so you're compelled to reset. In my own philosophy, I'm only okay with save scumming if it's an action that I realized shortly after making it that I could have made an alternative/more optimal one. This doesn't change RNG, only that it allows me to play a little faster without having to be take too much time every turn because a game already takes very long.\n+ When you highlight an enemy in the world map, it's inconsistent when it's able to show you available hexes.\n+ Pushing further on the transparency of all mechanics, I wish the game made even more ones clearer. For example, at what distance can you pick up party at a boat?\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nWatched Sodapoppin play several games since around 8/22/20. Having seen at least a dozen of hours of gameplay, I strolled through Apprentice diffiulty on my first playthrough with not too many difficulties, learning certain mechanics that I didn't when watching (though I did save scum quite a bit when I didn't know mechanics like using Life to revive enemies without having to go to inn, which I had ample; the unlucky RNG can easily end a game or force you to exhaust enough resources that you're now at a big disadvantage playing catchup on Chaos for the rest of the game).",

The game can also be a bit too tedious in its many collectibles, especially with Music Notes resetting if you die which can happen instantly in certain areas (e.g., Rusty Bucket Bay). I could not tolerate that without save scumming. Some areas are especially bad without save scumming that makes it annoying to replay: Rusty Bucket Bay, the crocodile minigame. Some puzzle solutions are also convoluted.\n\n__Story.__ Simple plot, but there is notable character to how the characters responds. The snappy Kazooie and straight man Banjo. The hilarious insults from Brentilda. The rhymes of Gruntilda.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Solid gameplay mechanics like Super Mario 64 and Spyro as a 3D platforming collectithon. There's a surprising amount of depth in the variety of platforming mechanics: jumps (jump, double jump, and standing jump); attacks (roll, swipe, Kazooie jump-attack, shoot attack and behind, Beak Barge), invulnerability, swapping to Kazooie or transforming to creatures to climb steep hills, and environment interactions (Shock Spring Jump, Flight Pad using red feathers, invulnerability using gold feathers, swimming, Wading Boots for dangerous areas like swamps, cold water, and quicksand, Turbo Trainers).\n\nLevels are varied in platforming, enemies, and artwork, brimming with opinion. I love how every level is nonlinear in its approach, allowing you to tackle them at your pace. The season switches of Click Clock Wood are especially ambitious. It seems tedious to play without a walkthrough however, knowing how to sequence each event, but it was fun following a walkthrough and seeing the progression of each mini-puzzle.\n\nIt's the Nintendo 64 generation, and camera control is notoriously bad. At least with Banjo Kazooie, you can control it somewhat with horizontal movement. But it's via buttons rather than analog stick, and has restricted movement near walls. To pan vertically, you have to enter a clunky first person view.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Colorful, diverse environments. I love the artwork in the characters. Game's graphics age quite well in 2020. Soundtrack is iconic. Frame rate is noticeably skippy and drops.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Unlike Super Mario 64, you don't just use your collectibles to unlock doors. You have to find the portrait with missing jigsaw pieces first, and then find the door.\n+ All the sounds Banjo makes: jumping sounds like Super Mario 64's jump; Bottle's noise when you interact with him like Crash Bandicoot's sound picking up a mask.\n+ Like other 3D platformers at its time, there are cheat codes.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ How to get some of the Jiggies are convoluted. I don't have the patience to figure out the right move to use without resorting to a guide.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Notes and Jinjo collected in levels are not preserved across levels. To be completionist, you'd have to try to collect them all on your first entry as subsequent entries start from scratch.\n+ You need to collect 882/900 Music Notes (and 94/100 Jiggies) to get all Note Doors. That basically means you can't skip a single level in getting 80/100.\n+ Draw distance is low. This actually makes a difference gameplay wise when you try to determine whether an area is worth pursuing (e.g., underwater corridor). Fixed apparently in Xbox 360 version.\n+ Swimming mechanics. Annoying as always.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI played the Nintendo 64 version on the Project 64 emulator (Banjo-Kazooie (U) (V1.1) set to use Glide64 video plugin). The best version is technically the Remastered version on an Xbox 360 emulator (Xenia). It involves HD sprites, native widescreen support, analogue camera controls, and 60 FPS. However, I couldn't find the Xbox XBLA ISO/ROM for the full game and not the trial. This is a rare case of a game having exclusively the best version on Xbox One (similar to Red Dead Redemption remaster). I played blind but looked at a walkthrough near the end of a level in order to get anything I'm missing or stuck on. I got all Jiggies (except one in Gruntilda's Lair), Honeycomb Pieces (except one in Spiral Mountain), 885/900 Music Notes (I was lazy on 8 in the last level), and most Mumbo Tokens (19 extra). I save scummed for parts that felt tedious, or I didn't know if it was dangerous, e.g., swimming underwater for Music Notes in Clanker's Cavern.",

There is noticeable jankiness, and some platforming sections are so frustrating as to make the last few chapters tedious to play (e.g., knowing exactly where to jump for the ledge in The Boat Chapter; the vertical climbing in Kate Chapter, final battle's last portion).

I couldn't care about a single character or the overarching setting to be honest.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Controls and HUD are easily Mirror's Edge most innovative mechanics to the industry. Mirror's Edge enhances the platforming feel under a realistic rather than cartoon setting. It introduces a myriad of core complexity in how to maneuver different obstacles: movement acceleration, sliding, vaulting, wall running, and red obstacles to indicate what's interactable (to my knowledge, the first game that they appear in). And a bunch of unique animations to interact with various objects: climbing fences, jumping on pipes, sliding down ropes, jumping off ramps and forcing to roll when landing large fall distances, run-on-wall-turn-jump, jumping and hitting a button to break glass as you enter, balancing tight walkropes. HUD is minimalist with no explicit objective trackers, just a head turning button to not get lost. The linear corridor-like platforming (which works well). I prefer this curated platforming approach than an open-world one. Level designs are sufficiently varied. Combat is easily the most dated piece of its gameplay. Its clunky enemies and combat controls makes me cringe whenever I have to fight instead of run.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ I like the colors, particularly the way it focuses on runner paths, although the outdoors is way too saturated.

It stands out in its unique combat elements: for example, lethality of player and enemy attacks, multiple enemies at a time, moveset variety, standoffs, duels, and ghost stance. Its aesthetics also have a cinematic appeal, particularly towards Samurai cinema, and the game benefits all the more for this vision.\n\nIts weaknesses is its lack of story and character depth like a blockbuster film. It also digs too deep into the open-world formula with uninteresting side quests and minigames, and basic genre elements such as crafting, platforming, and build variety.\n\n__Story.__ Blockbuster movie-level of quality here in the storytelling. It's full of standard tropes but polished in its cinematics and just character backstory. The beginning and end are particularly done well. It dives a little too much into the melodramatic and suffers from its reliance on tropes like any other blockbuster movie. I wish characters had more open flaws, e.g., if Sakai displayed overt racism or viewed peasants as lower. The conflict of samurai honor is hamfisted and just boring to be honest. I like that characters like Sensei Ishikawa and Masako are clearly flawed, although it's a bit one note in the storytelling across the sidequests. Regardless, all the character-based sidequests have end on a great note.\n\nWorldbuilding in terms of the environment feels a bit soulless to be honest. The large open areas feel empty, and there isn't much of a density in content. The content that does exist aside from the excellent scripted quests are pretty standard formulas in content.\n\n__Gameplay.__ For a AAA open-world title, there are typical lite elements from an arsenal of genres: combat, stealth, open world questing and crafting, platforming. Ghost of Tsushima stands out in its polish as well as its innovations, particularly in combat.\n\nCombat. The most distinct element of Ghost of Tsushima's combat is its lethality: both you and enemies can be felled by only a few strikes. I really like this system: it adds to the realism with the deadliness of combat and encourages gameplay with precision (timing, positioning, deflecting and dodging). Combat also involves multiple enemies at once rather than one-off like Soulsborne titles. Standoffs are flashy and build on the parry system, which is excellent. I love perfect parry and perfect dodge, which build on the cinematic style of minimal and swift ripostes. The moveset is also quite large (arguably too complex), with swordplay, ranged attacks, and stealth kills. Enemy variety is not outstanding but sufficient. Bosses (duels) further push on the lethality, bordering on the need for a perfect execution as they typically one-shot.\n\nThe controls are excellent: incorporating seamless modern improvements that are now mainstream like sliding if you crouch after sprinting, mantling, and the analog stick intensity affecting crouch's movement speed. The moveset features light attack, heavy attacks which inflict stagger damage and do more damage, charged heavy attack (typically a stab), jump kick, guard, dodge (particularly for spears and arrows), and parry which are quite complex in moveset. There are also stances similar to Nioh, additional Mythic Technique moves, and situational Ghost Weapons. Horse is convenient and doesn't require monitoring just like in Witcher 3. Health replenishing is limited based on the Resolve meter, which accumulates as you kill enemies and parry, which is a great limiter.\n\nThere are light stealth and platforming elements following other AAA titles. For stealth, enemy AI have a white marker that increases to yellow and red, one shot stealth melee kills from behind (and with nice story behind it going against the samurai code), plenty of vantage points and bushes for perfect invisibility, and focused hearing to track enemies. I like the enemy AI's basic system which captures the core of alerts (and that they alert locally, unlike many games where a single enemy alert immediately signals everyone). It's basic in its stealth arsenal, corpse detection, enemy detection variety, lack of sound/visibility grades, and tendency toward linear levels unlike immersive sims. The platforming is also light, with simple movement to climb and jump to areas and white markers to clearly delineate where you can move; taikanawa (grappling hook) like Sekiro. Platforming is most prominent to complete shrines.\n\nProgression system involves techniques, mythic combat arts, stances by killing mongol leaders, building your legend to unlock ghost weapons, and evolving tactics unlocked over the story.\n\nTons of collectibles, gameplay upgrades, and minigames (bamboo cutting, haikus, bathing, fox den, shrine platforming, etc.) to incentivize exploration. I like the way they encourage exploration while enabling immersion: guiding winds, yellow birds, and inari. The map also makes it easy to tell what areas you completed or have not discovered. There is in fact no HUD as you move through the game! Tracking in this game's quests relies on environmental details: this is a huge improvement to Witcher 3 and Horizon Zero's detective mode, which always felt like a lazy and less immersive experience. There are also Mongol territories to liberate similar to Far Cry's outposts.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Clear Kurosawa influences, and I love the explicit references and attribution to his work. Graphics are clearly top of this generation, including face models and facial animations. Ingame cutscenes of face models can be Yakuza 0 level of quality though, which is not great. Lip syncing is noticeably bad for Japanese audio. The amount of Fashion Souls and sheer variety in cosmetic choices is awesome. Costume details like mud and blood on your armor is great. Soundtrack does the highlights of Edo period feudal Japan well---nothing that stands out but it complements the game's direction.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Bamboo minigame. Badass game of cutting through bamboo. Engaging to try to execute a button combo within a short window.\n+ Wind as your navigating compass rather than a HUD option.\n+ Haiku minigame. Relaxing similar to the bath scenes.\n+ Unlike Witcher 3, you can now call and ride your horse from a running position instead of sacrificing movement to get on your horse.\n+ Checkpoints are very frequent, which balances well with the lethality of combat so you can immediately try combat again.\n+ \"Challenge Remaining Enemies\" prompt is a quality of life bonus to clear out enemies in a cleared outpost.\n+ Items you loot persist across reloaded checkpoints. So there is at least some progression if you have to constantly retry an area: at least you're partially grinding for mats!\n+ Open world is segmented into a linear progression of zones similar to Witcher 3, so before you move to the next zone, you know how much you can comfortably explore before moving on with the main quest.\n+ There's an incentive to liberate everything first. That way you don't have to go through the tedious process of unlocking all fog of war to make sure you didn't miss something.\n+ There's more than enough crafting materials to get most upgrades by the time you complete the first area, let alone all three.\n+ With Safe Landing, you need to roll to avoid damage when falling from certain heights. It's this interactivity that I enjoy in more involved platforming like the original Tomb Raider.\n+ Kurosawa mode. It's a little lazy as a filter, but I like the appeal of a black and white, with film reel age, no enemy HUD, and muffed audio. It especially works in the snow area of Act 3. Trying it combined with the Japanese dub and expert HUD style keep the game fresh as you complete the open world missions and explore. The lack of enemy posture bar and red glint for unblockable attacks (relying purely on the sound) makes the game just a tad harder.\n+ No romance, just mature-aged characters.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Heals are instant with 0 animation time.\n+ You can fast travel from any area and to many areas.\n+ Ingame cutscenes are not talking heads but feature NPC movement too.\n+ Looting is instantaneous and animation-free like Witcher 3.\n+ You can both observe and kill some leaders to get bonus points to unlock your stances. I don't like that this encourages optimal vs suboptimal play, where playing optimally limits the fun zone. Fortunately, stances are all very quick to acquire.\n+ Flute, Respect, and Sheathe are nice RP options but you're never rarely encouraged to use them.\n+ Expert HUD is another excellent option for improved immersion. I don't like how it's difficult to find merchants/questgivers however.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Focus hearing is way too overpowered in clearly seeing all enemies in your vicinity, including through walls. Like all detective modes, it would be better off not existing.\n+ If you die to a random encounter, the random encounter disappears.\n+ Can't change FOV.\n+ Tutorial still pops up mid way into game; there's no way to turn it off.\n+ Constantly needing to swap between Traveller's Attire and my main armor.\n+ Side quests are all broken up in bite-sized pieces rather than allowing them to take variable length. Breaks up pacing, particularly in having to travel to the next point if you just want to go through a full quest.\n+ You can't skip cutscenes or dialogue line by line. This combined with the inability to turn off tutorials ruins replayability. Lack of skipping also means you can't cruise through quests.\n+ Camera can be awkward at times, particularly during standoffs. Contrary to others, I found the automatic camera angles during duels worked well.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ charm loadouts for each armor (either emphasize the armor's style or offset its weaknesses) | https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/226261-ghost-of-tsushima/78875352\n+ https://www.powerpyx.com/ghost-of-tsushima-all-mongol-territories-locations-occupied-areas-outposts\n\n I started on hard difficulty, which is the second highest; I swapped to lethal (highest) a few hours into the game. Lethal is punishes mistakes more and stealth detection is higher. I especially love the idea of further increasing the player's lethality, upping the game's realism and one of Ghost of Tsushima's most distinct gameplay elements from any other video game with a rich combat system. The punishment difficulty is still nowhere near as hard as Sekiro for example: Sekiro bosses like Genichiro and Corrupted Monk took me a few hours, and I enjoyed the whole time; Ghost of Tsushima's Kojiro took me about 15 tries.\n\nI tried to use Japanese audio for the authenticity, but the game is clearly developed with English actors in motion capture and lip syncing: there are noticeable issues such as Japanese lip-syncing completely off, English subtitles based on the English script rather than the Japanese dialogue (which even I can tell, who only knows common Japanese phrasing), and you miss out on unsubbed idle NPC dialogue. I chose the black horse (Kage) as it seemed to fit the aesthetic better; later I went with the white horse (Nobu). I liberated all areas, completed all sidequests, and got most (but not all) collectibles, upgrades, and visited question marks on the map. Ending-wise, I decided to kill Shimura: I felt abiding by his honor was like an olive branch; and in practice, he would live the rest of his life in shame and ultimately force seppuku.\n\nBuild-wise, I did the following.\n\n+ Equipment. I use Samurai Clan armor, Charm of Okuninushi and Inari as major charms; and did minor charms ad hoc. With lethal difficulty, everything dies in 1-2 hits so more survability than damage is needed, and I like playing with minimal movement, encouraging a reactionary gameplay with parries and dodges. The two major charms improve utility outside of combat, and I prefer the nerf due to being overpowered from exploring and upgrading: I only swap if I'm having difficulty such as in duels. Midway into area 2, I completed most crafting needs so I swapped Inari with Mizu-no-kami (Amaterasu's health boost isn't as useful on Lethal). I also played with Gosaku armor, complemented with stagger charms, which plays offensively to chain stagger enemies; Sakai armor which has both survivability and offense; and Ghost armor for stealth missions and the RP since it's the coolest. In terms of Fashion Souls, I liked all black or all white palettes.\n+ Technique points. I prioritized in rough order the Deflection tree, Evasion tree, Water and Stone stance. I allocated to other stances, Ghost Weapons, and Evolving Tactics ad hoc.\n+ Crafting upgrades. I prioritized my Katana, Kunai, and Traveler's Attire, and did the rest ad hoc (Tanto, Bow, Arrows, other Ghost Weapons, armor). For Ghost Weapons, I prioritized Kunai and Smoke Bomb.\n+ The only exploration item I actively prioritized was the Traveller's Attire, Charm of Inari, and Charm Of Amaterasu; otherwise I explored and completed quests at my own pace.\n\nPlaystyle-wise, I stealth until detected or just start full frontal if I like the challenge. I don't focus too much on stealth as the game shines more in its rich combat. For stealth, this is the Tanto and occasionally the Wind Chime. For combat, I use the Katana, Kunai to break defenses, Black Powder Bomb for AOE, and Bow for ranged enemies if I prefer to keep my positioning. I never use Flaming Arrow, Smoke Bomb (it's already easy to retreat without the bomb, and full retreats to restealth are rarely needed), Sticky Bomb, or Blowdart. Moveset-wise, I start with standoffs or Mounted Strike from my horse. I use all stances but otherwise default to water. Other moves include Sprinting Strike. I never really use Heavenly Strike or Dance of Wrath (except duels), kicks, Shoulder Charge, Delayed Strike.",

    "date_finished": "7/28/20",
    "comments": "Death Stranding is a flawed video game artpiece. Its strengths are in its abstract imagery, traveling mechanics, multiplayer, environmental level design, and soundtrack. The main story connecting all the concepts is not good is often an exposition dump; the story would honestly be better if it was not explained. Its weaknesses are its character depth, clunky combat, stealth, enemy variety, boss fights, side quests, and world building outside of the main story itself. Despite all this, I enjoyed my time experiencing what the game offered, and both the artistic moments and the gameplay loop of traveling kept me engaged.\n\n__Story.__ I enjoy the abstract imagery: for example, fast-forwarding rain; invisible creatures that age the world and with hands as feet and whose form take on floating people with umbilical cords, babies connected to people, eating maggots, crying, multiple organizations at large, and skull face masks, aquatic creatures, strands and tying knots. There are also numerous concepts you face early in the game and which are slowly revealed: DOOMs, BTs, Beach, timefall, chiralum, necrosis, repatriate, Strand.\n\nOutside of its abstractness, the story is not good. Some scenes are mindbogglingly cringy in tropes: a damsel in stress wearing a red dress, \"I'm Fragile, but I'm not that fragile\", Higgs being punched and finally losing his powers, running on the beach, \"All that matter and anti-matter should have cancelled itself out\". The characterization in each chapter is decent but not stellar: it's a surface depth that isn't as engaging as, say The Last of Us where there's more background, understanding of motivation and emotional turmoil. I do like it if you treat it like an episodic adventure, each playing on a theme of life and death and social bonding (e.g., Sam's aphenphosmphobia). It could do really well as an TV series. Higgs has a cool design, but I wish he had an actual story to provide background. All the exposition dump (particularly at the end), and the twist after twist in the main story after Higgs, is also boring: classic Kojima not knowing how to write. The game would be better if it were like the trailers: cool abstract ideas and nothing explained. First, it's Higgs as the mastermind, then Unger, then the director, then Amelie.\n\n__Gameplay.__ I admire the game's choice to purely innovate on traveling mechanics like a realistic platformer, and with an emphasis on a \"social strand game\". Everything else is lacking but I thoroughly enjoyed the platforming. Regarding platforming, new mechanics are balance, momentum, and terrain, inventory management and backpack customization, maps and route planning, platforming tools, and PCC structures. It's like a AAA version of Getting over It. It takes the idea behind a fetch quest and makes it so involved in mechanics that it's actually interesting enough in variety from mission to mission. The compass is also a great way of navigating without having to regularly pull out the map. In no game has the terrain affected gameplay so much: rocky crags, mountain slopes, rivers, rain, slopes, snow, whiteouts, tumbling rocks. There's also a World War I/II setting, albeit disappointing in that it's only a linear arena for poor boss fights.\n\nI'm a big fan of Death Stranding's approach to nonintrusive, cooperative multiplayer. Players' structures benefit your gameplay but aren't overpowered: they aactivate only once the area is established in the chiral network so it helps more in mid-to-end game of that area rather than on first visit. Giving likes and donating materials to get likes mutually benefits yourself as well. Other multiplayer mechanics appear in terminals with free cargo and vehicles.\n\nThe little combat and stealth that exists in the game is surprisingly clunky and primitive. It's made to freshen up the main gameplay of platforming, but it would be better if it had at least been at the level of Uncharted/AAA games in stealth/third-person shooting, if not completely without it. Stealth detection and enemy AI is too awful that it's not viable against MULEs and terrorists. And boss fights are gorgeous but mechanically boring: for example, you fight Unger three times all of which are the same and not even fun the first time. So is the weapon arsenal and clunkiness of melee combat. The combat and stealth are a disappointment: it would have been fine even if it even matched MGS5's mechanics 5 years ago. Many pieces of the weapon arsenal are strictly worse than others. For example, EX grenades are better served by the Bola for stunning BTs if no blood grenades are available, which also works as the best weapon against MULEs.\n\nQuests outside of the main missions are lacking. I don't like standard orders (the variant of side quests). They are literally fetch quests with no story and the equivalent of Bethesda's radiant quests with their infiniteness, done purely to maximize a certain metric (here, area stars).\n\nInventory management is not just about carry capacity which is the extent of most games, but cargo attached to parts of your suit/back and affecting your balance, movement speed, and vehicle battery consumption. The HUD and health, endurance, and BB systems are also great. I like all the many aspects that you need to replenish based on gameplay elements such as visiting the hub, Crater Digestive Baths, resting, and drinking Monster.\n\nI like the multiple points as hubs, with a private room that you're encouraged to visit for gameplay reasons: story reasons; replenishing stamina, ammo, canteen, and BT; showers/excretions for blood pouches and grenades; fast travel; and backpack customization. Enemy variety (and boss variety) is also bad: BTs, MULEs, and MULEs with guns. For BTs, the easiest is simply to get caught, then run away, and the BT encounter is now gone allowing you to pick everything freely: much faster and resource-efficient than killing the spawned giant BT.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ I'm a big fan of Kojima's industrial aesthetic, and with a focus on abstract concepts percolating the world. Face models and environmental graphics are certainly the best in this generation, at the same level of The Last of Us Part 2. Despite all the gorgeous pre-rendered cutscenes, it's a shame however that most ingame character interactions are at the terminal with stocky animation. The soundtrack with all the music artists, especially Low Roar, is amazing.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Can't Be So Serious. Damn, what a banger as the opener. Low Roar has a lot of emphasis in this game, and they play my favorite genre: melodic pop/electronic.\n+ The void out scene when you first meet BB.\n+ The tedium of the first two Chapters, with the game really hitting its pace with item variety and exoskeletons in Chapter 3: as a redditor put it, from walking sim to civil engineer sim.\n+ Boss enemy designs are awesome: the whole idea behind squid ink/tar and aquatic creatures is a great horror theme different from your typical slasher or Lovecraft. Giant BTs are surreal.\n+ The Gullimero Del Toro-Sam shower scene.\n+ The music playing and the zoom-out as you traverse areas.\n+ Waiting 3 minutes in real time as Heartman is on the beach. True Kojima, like when you're stuck waiting in prison cells in MGS.\n+ Higgs-BT fight. That was such an annoying boss fight. It wasn't difficult because of the infinite ammo and blood bags. It was just tedious trying to hit him with rocket launchers that often miss, or assault rifles that don't much damage.\n+ The ending's two hour length of cutscenes. It surpasses even MGS4's record. Classic Kojima. It's high quality, but with so little gameplay it teeters on the edge of cinematic video games toward full-on movies: Kojima clearly would prefer being a filmmaker.\n+ The surreal feeling with Norman Reedus and Mads Mikkelsen feeling like a father-son relationship, and at the end they reveal BB is in fact you. Actually good surrealism.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Nothing is missable. I can play the game blind and not worry about missing anything or following optimal builds form the get-go.\n+ Like Metal Gear Solid, you can move the camera during the in-game cutscenes.\n+ Game does not pause when you alt-tab.\n+ \"Bridges hereby enters a contract with Sam Porter.\" I'm a big fan of repeated sayings (motifs?). Adds a rhythm and symbology to the world.\n+ Instead of going through the system options for a manual save, you can save by resting.\n+ Carrying on MGS' legacy of nonlethal combat.\n+ The concept of a boss fight where the boss has a gun and you're fighting him with cargo.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Private locker storage is specific to each site and not universally shared.\n+ Product placement taken to an entirely new level with it affecting gameplay: drinking Monster energy as a consumable to boost stamina.\n+ Autonomous bot-deliverable Standard Orders. Feels like something from a mobile game. It was weird in MGS5 and it's still weird in Death Stranding.\n+ So many cutscenes! Definitely the same as Metal Gear Solid.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Too many recycled micro-animations, and with such a frequency for even the mundane tasks like sleeping in the private room or recycling materials. I don't know of anyone who played the game and didn't skip through all the private room cutscenes for example.\n+ The backtracking missions at the end of the game. Clearly they ran out of content. The game should have just ended earlier. It's not so redundant since there's still things to do, and I like that Order 68 involves relying on your friendly porters for equipment as you lose access to the chiral printer.\n+ You're traveling through America, but the landscape is clearly Scandinavia.\n+ For a game so careful about its aesthetic, the deliveryman cargo box aesthetic when Sam is stacked is laughably bad.\n+ You can't play music freely while traversing, only in the private room.\n+ BB cutscenes are recycled after a while.\n+ Mail. I think it's useless and lazy exposition similar to MGS5's audio tapes.\n+ The tips tab is way too many.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/death-stranding/Connection_Level_Rewards_-_List_of_Upgrades_and_Unlocks_for_Knot_Cities,_Facilities,_and_Preppers#Spiritualist_-_Connection_Level_Rewards\n+ https://old.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/dy6zqy/death_strandings_open_world_design_no_spoilers/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/dz7yab/death_stranding_dunkview/f867r72/\n\nI played this near its PC launch date of July 14, 2020. I played with controller as it was designed that way. I played on normal difficulty. I only completed standard orders that were along the way. I only cared about maximizing stars for my preferred items: Bola Gun (Engineer), Power Skeleton (Craftsman), Speed Skeleton (Junk Dealer), Backpack Cover (Collector), Extra Battery (Philip North), Non-lethal Assault Rifle (Lockne), All-Terrain Skeleton (Roboticist), Monster Energy talisman (First Prepper).\n\nMy default loadout is no items, only a filled out Blood Punch and Boots on my Boot Clip; I equip Speed Skeleton (Power Skeleton for missions with large loads or mountainous terrain; later replaced with All-Terrain), Bridges Boots, Power Gloves; and once I got the backpack, I use 2x Extra Battery, Monster Energy talisman, Backpack Cover. Situationally, I add Ladder when traveling to new areas (for climbing steep terrain or rivers); PCC when using vehicle, low battery legs, or traveling to a new area without immediate chiral network setup; Climbing Anchor when traversing down mountains; container repair spray for snowy areas with long routes; floating carrier or long range truck for especially large loads; Bola (later, non-lethal assault rifle) for MULE missions (otherwise I just run from humans and BTs; in forced giant BT fights, players give you items like quadruple rocket launcher); 4x armor plates when preparing for MULE or boss encounter; Oxygen Mask for poisonous gas. I prefer the reverse trike for general movement except rocky/mountainous terrain.\n\nI never used most other items: for example, Smoke-Emitting Decoy, Smoke Grenade, Stun Bomb, Floating Carrier, Anti-BT Handgun, Sticky Gun, Heat Pad. On skeletons, I like Speed the most. It gives a strict movement speed and jumping distance increase. Unlike Power, you can still attach two items to your legs (Suit). I also like the balance mechanic as it adds skill to movement; the advanced technique is to sprint straight and hold L2/R2 whenever you need to steer. Grenades are better than other anti-BT weapons because they take up no extra space with grenade pouches. But BTs are rare enough during general encounters that you never need them; during boss encounters, players give you items. For humans, the non lethal assault rifle is the best ranged when melee with strand is not sufficient; it also doubles as a BT weapon.\n\nSome advanced techniques: minimal inventory; full item variety usage; cancelling MULE scanner pings with your odradek or jumping to evade, jumping with a bike.\n\ntodos\n\n+ Speed Skeleton level 3 (Junk Dealer)\n+ Backpack Cover level 3 (Collector)\n+ Extra Battery level 2/3 (Philip North)\n+ Monster Energy talisman (First Prepper)",

I Just couldn't get into it to be honest, so I grinded out the second half of the game.\n\n__Story.__ Barely existent but that's okay for a platformer.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Rayman's playforming is about speed and ingenious level design. It's a particularly smooth experience and with ample checkpoints. Plenty of exploration via secret areas to collect pink guys, and all the coins. I love the massive level variety across worlds, new enemies, and the many platforming mechanics: dash jump, gliding, shrinking, air vehicle, wind geysers, sliding ice, ice cubes, and many more.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Love the gorgeous comic art and colorful palette.

    "date_started": "7/16/20",
    "date_finished": "7/18/20",
    "comments": "Doom Eternal is everything you'd expect of a sequel to an excellent game: innovations to Doom (2016)'s core battle mechanics (particularly with Dash, Flame Belch, and meat hook), new weapon variations, significant enemy variety, particularly with the incredible enemies each adding to the overall gameplay experience as Hugo Martin calls chess pieces, and a badass soundtrack. Doom Eternal also features ambitious level designs with platforming and verticality.\n\nFlaw-wise, there are no major ones. Level designs still feature too many arenas. Doom (2016) did the aesthetic, rune variety, and power ups better but Doom Eternal otherwise improved everything. The Marauder is controversial but nowhere near as bad as, e.g., Doom II's Pain Elemental.\n\n__Story.__ The story is serviceable like Doom (2016), but even more over the top. The humans to Doom interactions are hilariously good. Otherwise I don't really care for it. The first half has way more cutscenes than the second half, and some of hte introduced characters like the Betrayer and King Novik just disappear in the rest of the game.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Doom Eternal makes significant improvements across a number of gameplay factors: controls, resource management, and enemies. For controls, there are simple, powerful additions: dash and meat hook on the super shotgun (both of which make aerial combat and large open arenas more prevalent), chainsaw is an action rather than a weapon that you swap to before chainsawing (and which regenerates rather than consumes ammo); no crouch; Flame Belch; Blood Punch. Each of these simple changes alters the gameplay in such a great way. The Dash is the FPS genre's best attempt at what makes Dark Souls 3's dodge so great, but here it's especially made to be aggressive (forward moving rather than side moving) in spirit to the Doom style. The meat hook adds a whole new layer of mobility to shotguns, both moving directly to the enemy and the advanced technique of moving in and jump-cancelling, or using it to move forward and sideways. Resource management is now overhauled with fewer ammo per weapon, and with these additions to make weapon swapping most viable, treating minions almost as walking resource bags. This includes the Flame Belch, which actually makes armor pickups viable rather than one-off. New to the glory kill and chainsaw mechanics is the Flame Belch for picking up armor shards off enemies. Glory kills also build up a meter for Blood Punch, which is basically a more powerful melee.\n\nEnemies are overhauled both in their design as chess pieces and an impressive enemy variety, with both new enemies and revivals. All the new enemies are designed very well and really do add new chess pieces that diversify the gameplay. For example, arachnotron and mancubuses are heavy hitters and require prioritizing their cannons. Enemies have plasma shields necessitating the Plasma Rifle, including a new support enemy Carcass. I also like the variety in mechanics such as buff totems, Arch-Viles' summoning, and Carcass' shield. Increased enemy variety includes from Doom 2 such as Arachnotron, Pain Elemental, and Arch-vile, revisions such as Fireborne Baron, Dread Knight, Empowered enemies, and new ones such as Gargoyle, Whiplash, Tentacles, Tyrant, Doom Hunter, and Maykr Drones. The last level with arenas throwing everything at you with multiples of heavy units like Tyrants, Barons of Hell, Doom Hunter, and Pain Elemental is so great; that and the industrial aesthetic reminds me of the last levels of Doom II. On flaws, the Marauder is a controversial enemy, and certainly one of the most considered flaws in the game because it forces a parry-like timing window where you have to wait and maintain a certain distance, and that goes against the entire Doom (2016)/Eternal bullish ethos: it's Doom, not Dark Souls.\n\nLevel design-wise, I unfortunately don't think Doom Eternal improved too much upon Doom (2016)'s flaw of the repetitive pattern of linear corridor followed by arena deathmatch. Doom Eternal simply replaced the corridor with platforming and puzzle-solving. This is an improvement to be sure: I like using the full ability that the new movement options in Doom Eternal have with Dash and Double Jump, and environments feature more verticality with wall climbing, and variety via goo, original Doom's acid and rad suit, destructible and movable objects, and Dash refill orbs. However, it doesn't solve the core issue of enabling an open level design similar to Doom (2016)'s Foundry, which harkens back to the original Doom levels consisting of a large open area where you traverse however you want, trying to find keys to progress onward. The original Doom levels certainly suffered from its own repetition of key-finding, but its more open-ended exploration and backtracking set up so many memorable moments: for example, the iconic element of ambushes as you go through corners or pick up items.\n\nProgression roughly follows Doom (2016) with unlocked weapons, weapon mods via Mod Bots, weapon upgrade points, Sentinel Crystals which replace Argent Cells and also feature miscellaneous upgrades on top of Health/Armor/Ammo, and Runes. There's now a hub, and I hate hubs. It's especially pointless for a mission-by-mission game like Doom: there is no need for backtracking to shops, crafting, or NPCs.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The music is even more impressive than the first game, and that's saying something. Speaking frankly, it attests to the gameplay better than any game I've ever played. Some iconic ones are the intro and BFG 10000. The enemy animations and glory kill variety are excellent. The aesthetic is more arcadey than the darkness that Doom (2016) had: colorful, oversized items and powerups, intrusive HUD. I prefer Doom (2016)'s aesthetic. Level aesthetics are honestly still a little forgettable in its generic hell and metallic environments. But the open areas and backdrops make it quite enjoyable.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ I __love__ the fast travel mechanic. It's unlockable only after every reaching the end of each level in order to let you warp around to pick up any remaining collectibles. With this mechanic, I no longer have to feel pressured to explore everything immediately due to sometimes passing through irreversible linear areas. I can freely play a level at my pace and pick up all remaining secrets afterwards. It's a shame collectibles sometimes bug out.. When reloading the game near the end after I unlocked fast travel, it no longer unlocked fast travel; and in Cultist Base, one battle arena never completed to give me the last Weapon Upgrade point.\n+ Difficulty options now let you toggle from Nightmare in a single playthrough instead of being locked to it.\n+ The map is actually navigable with intuitive mouse controls and a readable 3D map that actually works. Many games fail at 3D maps.\n+ Like Doom (2016), I'm a big fan of the quickswitching meta for single-shot weapons. It builds on the frenetic gameplay and utilization of the weapon variety. Fuck weapon wheels.\n+ Menu has keyboard shortcuts to navigate more quickly.\n+ Game has a decent weapon pool from the beginning, so you're not gimped with just a Shotgun like in Doom (2016).\n+ Enemies fighting each other as you enter areas, just like the original's monster infighting.\n+ Boss fights appear much earlier in the game rather than Doom (2016)'s weird pacing where they only appear near the end. (To be fair, this is like original Doom, but I think even original Doom suffered from this.)\n+ I don't know if it's just my gameplay improved, but I find actual use cases for grenades in this game unlike Doom (2016). The added utility of frost grenade obviously helps. But I use the frag grenade now too.\n+ Hazmat bonuses are not one-off but respawn. It's also health based rather than time-based. I hated this so much in Doom (1993) and Doom II as it limited exploration as you had to use the hazmat wisely.\n+ Tutorial windows require the button they're teaching you in order to dismiss.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ You can only chainsaw minions, not any major enemies like Doom (2016).\n+ Melee punch doesn't do much damage. This includes not even being able to punch the weakest mob to glory kill status.\n+ One new game mode are master levels, brought back from original Doom.\n+ There are mastery tokens so you can byhpass challenges. \n+ Power ups are more subdued in this game and not as awesome as the rage that Doom (2016)'s melee combos had.\n+ Ammo of each type is lowered to incentivize weapon swapping.\n+ Blood Punch. With all the other things, including grenade and chainsaw cooldowns going on, it's hard to predict. You sort of benefit from them as a bonus, not something predetermined.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ The HUD is too busy, way more icons than the first game. I turned off a lot of it: active runes, compass, keycard stock.\n+ There's too many collectibles. The gameplay progression collectibles are Praetor Tokens, Runes, Sentinel Crystal (equivalent to Doom (2016)'s Argent Cell), Mod Bots, Sentry Batteries (which unlock upgrades at your hub), secret encounters (necessary for 100% demonic completion for weapon upgrades), Slayer Gates (which unlock a weapon and add to weapon upgrades), and mission challenges (necessary for Praetor Suit upgrades and Sentinel Crystals). Some collectibles don't have gameplay incentives: codex entries, cheat codes, extra lives. I think this is too much, but fortunately the map and fast travel mechanics make getting all collectibles not too tedious.\n+ Rune variety and rune challenges were a bit better in Doom (2016) than Doom Eternal.\n+ Enemy kills can sometimes glitch, making it impossible to get 10/10 for a level. I've encountered this in 3 different levels.\n+ No death counter. This would be hugely helpful for practicing Ultra Nightmare by doing Nightmare runs.\n+ There are two buttons for Frag and Frost Grenades: toggle grenade and throw grenade. There should just be a dedicated button for each, and this is likely a flaw due to console support.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Gamepressure walkthrough](https://guides.gamepressure.com/doom-eternal) | My favorite walkthrough just like Doom (2016). It keeps it short and sweet by highlighting all the collectibles in each level, along with a map.\n+ [Performance settings](https://www.tweaktown.com/guides/7757/doom-graphics-performance-tweak-guide/index.html)\n+ [Marauder quick kill methods](https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/g3wphv/marauder_quick_kill_methods) | The 2 Lock-on RL is patched in October 2020, but a [variants still work:j [Arbalest/2 Frag/2 Lock-on](https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/jza0ow/did_the_wombo_combo_to_marauder_took_some), [Arbalest/2 Frag/Auto Shotgun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnSN6Rg8Anw), and [PB/Frag/2 Lock-on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55bG8KCaDtk).\n+ [Perfecting the Precision Bolt tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1Ac4wfREaA)\n+ [Mastering the Meathook tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K87JhTcLJHg)\n+ [UnderTheMayo's keybinds for smooth quick switching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELBt4XL75VM)\n\nLike all other Doom games, I played on Ultra Violence on my first playthrough. I didn't care for the XP or multiplayer. I played blind, only using a walkthrough for collecting all secrets when I'm near completing a level. I got all collectibles except a handful that I missed due to bugs (e.g., switch no longer turning on, enemy not being counted on 10/10 meter, fast travel not unlocking on reload checkpoint) and which I couldn't be bothered to replay. I did research the meta for best weapon mods, weapon upgrades, runes, and Sentinel Crystal upgrades. On my second playthrough I played on Nightmare and followed mostly the same choices. The game's pacing on a second playthrough is so much nicer since I know all the routes and build choices, and it's just a matter of executing the core combat loop.\n\nMy weapon rotation is the following.\n\n+ __General navigation.__ Super Shotgun for its meathook.\n+ __Close-range DPS.__ Super Shotgun / Precision Bolt. For priority targets, I preempt with Frost Grenade / Frag Grenade to focus them down.\n+ __Mid-range DPS.__ Precision Bolt / Rocket Launcher has the highest DPS in the game due to their quickswitch speed.\n+ __Hitscan DPS.__ Precision Bolt / Ballista. Hitscan is useful for long range, weak points, and mobile enemies.\n+ __Sustain.__ Flame Belch + Chainsaw for both armor and ammo. Flame Belch + Rocket Launcher or Frag Grenade for armor on AoE area. Glory Kills and Blood Punches for health.\n+ __AOE.__ I use frag grenades and Rocket Launcher.\n+ __Situational use cases.__ Frost grenades as a panic button, Combat Shotgun's sticky grenade for Cacodemons, Plasma Rifle for erasing enemy shields, Plasma Rifle's Microwave Beam for stunning advancing enemies, Blood Punch on specific enemies like Pinky, Cyber Mancubus, or Doom Hunter, Ballista's Arbalest for the spawncamp/timed ambush, BFG for known areas for Ultra Nightmare, and Crucible for priority targets (Arch Viles, Tyrants, or Barons).\n+ __Never used.__ I don't use Unmakyr as it shares BFG ammo and is strictly worse. I don't use Combat Shotgun and Heavy Cannon's primary fire since they share ammo with Super Shotgun and Chaingun respectively. I haven't found a use case for Chaingun aside from proccing Glory Kills on minions and switching to when I'm out of shells, cells, and rockets.\n+ __Advanced techniques.__ This includes: quickswitch weapon combos, ultra quickswitching with Precision Bolt, Flame Belch + Chainsaw, meathook navigation, Ballista boost to propel yourself, frost grenade CC utilization, map awareness and enemy priority, staying in air, bunny hop, punch canceling.\n\nI use the default keybindings and remap Heavy Rifle (2) to Mouse4, Rocket Launcher (4) to Mouse5, Super Shotgun (5) to Q, Ballista (6) to F, Chaingun (7) to Z, and BFG/Unmakyr (8) to X. PB / RL is the most used quickswitch combo and having them on mouse lets you move with WASD without interruption.\n\nProgression-wise on new playthroughs, I prioritize the [following in order](https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/gzxm5f/ultra_nightmare_runners_what_are_your_preferred):\n\n+ __Runes.__ Air Control, Equipment Fiend, Saving Throw, Blood Fueled.\n+ __Praetor suit upgrades.__ Fundamentals (Hot Swapper, Grappler, Faster Dasher), Environment (Thicker Skin), Frost Grenade, Fundamentals (Hit and Run) Frag Grenade (all), Environment (remaining), Exploration (all).\n+ __Sentinel crystals.__ Quickdraw Belch, Loot Magnet (necessary for picking up armor during SSG's meathook so you can get more armor during Doom Hunter Base), Belch Armor Boost, Health for Blood, Armor for Blood, Napalm Belch.\n+ __Weapon upgrades.__ Combat Shotgun's Quick Rack, then save until Super Shotgun and then Rocket Launcher. The rest are lower priority: Combat Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Chaingun, Ballista. SSG's mastery is the only one I really use. I farm it on lower minions, mastering by early in Doom Hunter Base.\n\nSee `journal/2021-07.md` for my ultra nightmare notes.",

    "title": "Divinity: Original Sin",
    "score": "7",
    "date_started": "7/4/20",
    "date_finished": "7/14/20",
    "comments": "Divinity stands out in its innovative mechanics and combination of elements to make CRPGs an excellent RPG subgenre in the modern setting. This is particularly in its battle mechanics such as the combinations for elemental effects and general environmental navigation integrated into the combat.\n\nDivinity's greatest weakness is its pacing. The first area takes half of the game, and the beginning hours of Cysael do not reflect the gameplay-intensive areas later in the story where it shines. Divinity also suffers from introducing too many mechanics, particularly on ensuring viability, and without ease in having players master their mechanics before progressing: you're inundated with the whole slew from the start. The story is also serviceable but not thrilling.\n\n__Story.__ The story is generic fantasy and with a campy feeling in its light hearted dialogue. They're fairly boilerplate in walls of text. Nothing in-depth in both the story or the player agency like Witcher 3.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Building on CRPGs, Divinity most stands out in its elemental combinations, affecting environments across ground surfaces, clouds, and weather; enemy weaknesses; and status effects. The challenging difficulty further encourages mastery. With Enhanced Edition, versatility is also better encouraged than specialization (namely, spreading skill points rather than 5 points into any magic school; you spend X amount of talent points for a given talent level instead of all levels being equal). There are so many viable spells that wizard's hotkey bar spans to 3 bars of commonly used spells; others are 2. Combine this with the CRPG depth in mechanics, including attributes, abilities, talents, traits, equipment, resistances. Dialogue follows an RNG system but is still rooted on stats (charm specifically). Gold comes from looting, stealing, and crafting; and D&D damage mechanics like Saving Throws and weapon types such as slashing, crushing, and piercing damage have varying effects. There are also crafting/identify/repair/weapon improvement mechanics, categorized as crafting, blacksmithing, and loremaster, and with ample recipes to discover.\n\nA notable gameplay element is the seamless integration of free roam interaction and combat interaction. Many combat abilities  still apply during free roam, and is part of the game such as to handle environmental dangers like poison clouds. Examples include healing (which makes the game effectively a soft reset after every battle), haste for faster movement, attacking NPCs/chests, teleport spell and crystals. The party members can also free roam asynchronously, allowing for strategies like talking to an NPC with one member to move his line of sight, and then another member proceeds to steal.\n\nRegarding Divinity's craftmanship, I initially found the mechanics intimidating as they're never explained and not transitioned into the game. But once I learned it by reading online, I really enjoyed it. Crafting includes not only creating new equipment, but also consumables such as special arrows, potions, and skill books; repairing; identifying items; upgrading weapons; and even telekineses for being able to pick up items from afar. I particularly appreciate its simplicity regarding ingredients: instead of farming mats and trying to craft for a specific RNG skill, you only need 1-2 ingredients; and after crafting, you can melt it back down to recover the original raw materials to craft again until you get the desired outcome (but it only works for swords and axes, not daggers or bows..; at least save scumming helps). Crafted gear is at your level, which combined with melting, means crafted gear effectively levels with you.There are also ample assets in the world that add to the crafting experience: anvils, forges, whetstones, barrels, many things that you can assemble by yourself. Meta-wise, crafting is encouraged because it's both the most efficient way to make money and typically better than loot or merchant gear.\n\nI wish I enjoyed Divinity as much as it excelled from purely a technical and gameplay loop perspective. I didn't like all the micromanaging I had to do with consumables and the many hybrid classes' many spells that I had to work with. In retrospect, I would prefer specialist roles, and ideally, explicit tank and healer roles even though Divinity does not incentivize this. CRPGs just don't abide by the tank-DPS-healer trinity of MMOs. I only like it because it simplifies class roles, forcing characters into specific abilities/use cases; an alternative party composition of specialized roles may also work.\n\nUnfortunately, many mechanics are actually not very useful, and should be practically ignored: PER attribute; because dialogue uses a rock paper scissors game with RNG instead of hard-thresholded skill checks, Personality's Charisma is bypassed by save scumming; Lucky Charm is not optimal gold-wise; Craftmanship's Telekinesis; all of Nasty Deeds; most talents; henchmen. Like Pokemon, it's often better to stock up a single companion with one-off abilities as the equivalent of an HM slave inbetween quests: Bartering, Blacksmithing for repairing and crafting, Crafting, and Loremaster for identifying; reputation mechanic only affects default NPC attitude, no story (e.g., dialogue) consequences. With Walk-in-Shadows, you can safely steal from NPC locations.\n\nEnemy variety is fresh throughout the game. I also love the many \"world bosses\" that aren't tied to a quest but rather free roaming with loot rewards. This encourages exploration.\n\nStarting with Cyseal's massive quests in the beginning kills the game's combat pacing. The ratio of time spent in town for quests vs pure gameplay in later parts of the game are not nearly similar. Proper sequencing of Cyseal's interconnected quests is impossible without a walkthrough.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The isometric and Unity-like graphics remind me of Shadow Tactics, which is serviceable but not stellar.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ The first game where I'm managing 20-30 skills per character on my hotbar (sometimes even going to the fourth bar!), and they're all actively used! At times I don't like it because it requires so much managing. But I do like the idea that you've got a tool for every situation.\n+ Taking advantage of a Hail Attack cast right before some battles start. Not only is Hail Attack massive damage AoE, but also CC and can be done without of line of sight.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Unlike Baldur's Gate, there are only 4 companions instead of 25. Quality over quantity: each are fully voiced with some (although not that great) backstory.\n+ Like action RPGs, you can hold mouse click to move instead of spam clicking like Baldur's Gate. You can't hold mouse while having the map open though, or click on the map to move.\n+ You're encouraged to read books as they add to recipes and XP.\n+ Like Baldur's Gate, quests do not provide explicit objectives.\n+ Quick save works during all of free roam, combat, and dialogue.\n+ Merchant buy/sell prices are a function of their your bartering skill and their attitude towards you. It doesn't depend on merchant type though.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ You can fast travel from anywhere.\n+ Merchant items including spellbooks restock every hour and every level. This adds some realism. But it's also inconvenient in picking up fundamental skills that you want for all four party members.\n+ You walk if you click close to your character. You run if you click farther away. Adds immersion and realism but is also quite slow.\n+ Repair and identify are effectively free if you have the hammer and identify magnifier and allocated skill.\n+ No day/night or weather cycle.\n+ Hilariously, you can kill NPCs for XP.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ NPCs repeat their line every 5 seconds! This is grating, particularly if you're in town managing your inventory and vendoring.\n+ You can only respec main characters, not companions. You also lose all learned spells and skills, making it very inconvenient.\n+ Starting Divinity by creating two characters from scratch is intimidating to say the least.\n+ You can sort your inventory, but you can't keep it auto-sorted.\n+ Loot is randomly generated instead of predetermined.\n+ I do like the depth in needing various items for certain mechanics such as repair hammer, ming pickaxe, identify magnifier. However, these can be difficult to come by unless you're explicitly paying attention to it. They should be stock in a merchant inventory so it's easy to get once you know that you need it.\n+ Quest dependencies are not documented well, and progressing one can block progress on another.\n+ Immunities are counterintuitive. Status effect immunities like burning mean immunity to the burning status effect, but you can still take fire damage. Elemental immunities bring immunity to that elemental damage, but you can still get fire damage from teh burning status effect.\n+ Unlike WoW, it's shift drag to split an item stack, not shift click.\n+ There's no way to tell which books you already read.\n+ Keys take up bag space. With the absurd amount of keys in this game, it's a nuisance to manage.\n+ Madora's southern US accent is ingratiating for a medieval European game.\n+ All the tiny switches you have to find as the \"puzzle\".\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki/Divinity:_Original_Sin\n+ https://www.tihie.com/divinity-original-sin-ee\n+ level zones | https://imgur.com/a/uK4zS\n+ crafting guide | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1skVuINeNSoqDYqn7FzufVtXS3sxUK-cp1Zgb73uV6lI/edit\n+ level reqs (8/11/19) for crafting +1/2/3 speed dagger/bow | https://www.reddit.com/r/DivinityOriginalSin/comments/506o24/how_would_i_make_a_1_speed_dagger/\n+ save scumming for merchant inventory | https://www.reddit.com/r/DivinityOriginalSin/comments/76549m/vendor_restocks_savescumming_and_you/\n\nBefore playing this, I played its influential predecessors first in order to deepen my experience: isometric CRPGs like Baldur's Gate series, Planescape Torment, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights; and games like Deus Ex, KOTOR, Mass Effect, Dragon Age. If I like Divinity enough, I can also delve into Disco Elysium and Pillars of Eternity, other high-profile modern takes on CRPGs.\n\nI played on classic mode (normal difficulty). I completed almost all side quests (effectively required to stay on level for the main game), and I completed secrets based on if I encountered them blind. I used default controls but with: party member selection to Shift+number keys; center camera to H; select party member prev/next as Q/E. I found 12 of 17 blood stones.\n\nBuild-wise, I used Tihie's to simplify decision-making: elemental ranger (main), dual-wielding grenade wizard (main), shadowblade (Jahan), two-handed leadership knight (Madora). Bairdotr served in base as a mule; Wolgraff is never used. I also followed the optimal traits. I mucked around with appearances but kept default names (Scarlett and Roderick). Scarlett is an expert marksman with water magic. Roderick is a battlemage: he not only has mastery in ranged DPS via water and air elements (early game, grenades) but also in melee DPS via scoundrel and man-at-arms. Jahan is like the battlemage but with increased emphasis on scoundrel, where dual daggers enables +6 SPD. Madora is a knight with strong melee DPS (particularly early game) and the leadership party buff. Most party members have at least 1 point in the elemental schools, man at arms, and scoundrel for increased utility. Formation-wise, I did a T sequenced as Madora (center), Roderick, Jahan, Scarlett; and I free-roamed with Scarlett as the active member for perception, charisma, and pet pal talent.\n\nThe build worked well, but early game was messy: it needs both elemental arrow and grenade consumables, it needs early game crafting of +SPD daggers on both the wizard and shadowblade, AP is dreadfully low due to mostly no CON/SPD allocation. Midgame, I did not find any knives to make crafted speed daggers, which is essential for Roderick and Jahan's DPS as their stat allocation doesn't involve speed; I didn't know their role early game to keep any I found (unlike knives, Roderick's axe and Madora's two-handed axe is recycleable; and Scarlett's bow requires branch and bowstring which I found enough). Fortunately from this tip, I was able to pick up 12 knives off the dining table in Homestead (https://steamcommunity.com/app/230230/discussions/0/45350245096753459/, https://www.reddit.com/r/DivinityOriginalSin/comments/4576mz/knives_location_question/). Overall, I appreciate that the build makes effective use of all consumables and skills in the game, requiring a comprehensive understanding of the full mechanics. As I got to level 8, I got a better grasp at what the \"Spells Specific\" guide was recommending in terms of early-to-mid-to-late game playstyles (https://steamcommunity.com/app/373420/discussions/0/357284767244750359/). I modified some aspects as I never used food or potions for short-time buffs. To compensate, I got Glass Cannon earlier for Ranger and prioritized Bow, Expert Marksman, and Witchcraft to summon Armored Undead Decapitator and then pick off enemies. For skillpoint books and Mystical Tome, I put them into weapon stats I would get later; endgame I used remaining skillpoints for Bodybuilding and Willpower. I gave Death Knight Bane to Scarlett.\n\nThe build's crafting is not explained well. The major crafts are the weapons, explained in thetrueavatar's comment:\n\n\"Ranger: +1/2/3 speed bow\nShadowblade: 2x +1/2/3 speed dager\nDual Weilding: +1/2/3 speed dager and +4/6 crit one handed axe- buffalo or planet sword past level 22\nLeadership= +4/6/8% crit two handed axe\nLevel to start/change are 7/14/22\nEverytime add tormented soul and improve damage\nAdd tenebrium at level ???\nAdd elemental damage at ??\"\n\nMerchant-wise, I used the fish trader in Cysael early game, then the smith after I saved him in Silverglen midgame, then the Immaculate Trader in The End of Time endgame.\n\nWalkthrough-wise, there are no good ones. There's no canonical wiki or list of popular builds. The existing wiki's are sparse in detail. I found the GameFAQs guide the most detailed as a beginner learning the game and deciding how to build out characters (https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/170514-divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition/faqs/72764). Tihie's guide is the most informed in metagame but obtuse. Gamepressure's walkthrough is helpful for figuring out how to sequence side quests (particularly on any ones you're missing to stay on level).\n\ntodos\n\n+ maradino's lair for slaves and masters and frederick's blood stone\n+ forge of souls\n+ well wish for free loot",

This polish is given by responsive and intuitive motion controls, seamless platforming level designs with action, and easily understood player and enemy animations.\n\n__Story.__ Servicable like an action film.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Titanfall 2 features responsive modern controls with sliding, wall running, double jump, mantling, sliding down cables, gun tilt aiming when you crouch. It makes for seamless platforming on top of tight gunplay, and I'm most surprised by how elegantly the game introduces new platforming mechanics across the story: time warp; arc; cranes.

I like the ability to cloak when under duress.\n\nThe mecha provides a great change of pace from the vanilla firing.\n\nThe weapon and enemy variety is serviceable but ultimately forgettable.

    "comments": "Minecraft's sandbox and excellent core systems makes it the king of emergent gameplay: so many individual elements combining together to create awesome techniques.\n\nThe actual endgame is not great, as exploring the world is tedious with the lack of movement options, and combat is bad.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Minecraft seamlessly integrates so many interesting elements in its sandbox: crafting, building, equipment, mining, dungeon crawling, health and eating, vast biomes, dimensions, and mobs, and mod community. The core idea of blocks that can be destroyed, upgrade to improved blocks, and replaced works so well. There have been so many emergent gamplay techniques: mining techniques such as the staircase, branch mining (https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Mining); making a huge flag so you know where your homebase is from afar, and with a ladder near the bottom so you can catch it before taking fall damage after building it; infinite water source; optimal ranching for infinite food production; optimal farming plantations; standing on trees as a vantage point; traimming just the top of the bamboo; jumping up to build a vertical pole; using XYZ coordinates to keep track of key locations liike your home base.\n\nI love the crafting variety. From all the fundamental building blocks such as wood, coal, cobblestone, etc.; to the higher-order items such as the table for crafting, furnace for smelting, chest for storing, anvil for repairing, table for enchanting, and brewing.\n\nEnemy variety is fairly lackluster. Combat is especially plain and not fun.\n\nXP levels are spent, rather than accumulated to improve stats or skill points as in RPGs.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Timeless blocky style, especially praiseworthy of an indie game. I like the occasional soundtrack. Adds to the sandbox gentle vibe.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Falling in lava with full diamond gear and losing everything. Happened in two playthroughs!\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Game auto-pauses when you alt tab. But you can work around this by opening the world to LAN.\n+ Death penalty drops all your items in player inventory at the location of death, as well as some XP orbs. It's like an aggressive version of Diablo, as your items are not ensured to stay there (especially if you die in lava).\n+ Save system is automatic.\n+ Simple, intuitive control scheme. The mouse press shortcuts are power shortcuts that are not necessary for a beginner but easily speed up the monotony.\n+ Recipe book makes crafting extremely accessible, where you would otherwise have to reference a wiki alongside the game.\n+ Achievements capture per playthrough's progress.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ No real repair functionality. It's typically better to just craft new items. The anvil technically solves this, but the XP costs are so high that the XP grind is not worth the grind to remake the item.\n+ You can't destroy items from inventory, just dump items in a hole or throw them into lava. Mending is the best enchantment for this reason.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Farming is required if you want a permanent home.

I played survival mode on normal difficulty for my first playthrough for several hours but then switched to hard mode. Combat isn't the best, but the game feels more thrilling with the danger. The game is honestly best early to mid game when you're building out rather than late game where all resources are fully automated and it's a grindfest, so hardcore is a better bet later, but completing mid game already takes 10+ hours. To organize my quickmenu, I use Suggestion 3 of https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Organization. I prefer Y12 for strip mining as you never get lava on the ground, only when you encounter crevices. I always use the highest level upgrade (e.g., diamond pickaxe): my prediction is it mines faster and therefore also lets you find diamond faster to make it worth (https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/24rugw/psa_using_iron_pickaxes_to_save_diamonds_doesnt/).",

    "date_started": "6/29/20",
    "date_finished": "6/30/20",
    "comments": "Deus Ex helped launch the immersive sim subgenre building on ideas from Thief, enabling player agency: multiple approaches to tackle missions with less explicit goals, open-ended design, and emergent gameplay from core systems in stealth and action. Deus Ex advances the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy of the game (dungeon master) reacting to player choice better than CRPGs like Baldur's Gate. Unlike games like Thief and System Shock, Deus Ex also introduces RPG mechanics enabling build variety and replayability (something Dishonored would also further).\n\nPlaying the game in 2020, it has not aged well. So I can appreciate its innovations but can't enjoy actually playing it. The controls are awful. AI and stealth is just too janky. The graphics and voice acting have a charm, but only in the B-rated late 90s style.\n\n__Story.__  The overall story is decent in having some memorable characters. But it's not nearly as praiseworthy in depth as fans would claim. The Hong Kong triad story felt borderline racist in its stereotypes, including accents that seem exaggerated by white voice actors. To be fair, however, stereotypes appear even in the overarching story with the Illuminati creating a pandemic and a cure. It's really only the influence of killing off various characters and how the story goes on that makes the story interesting.\n\nThere are only a handful of side quests, which don't add new characters but build out the world more similar to Dishonored. I like this style of RPG (the immersive sim).\n\n__Gameplay.__ The game is truly an immersive sim (as coined by the Deus Ex creator), playing similarly to Thief and Dishonored in its stealth emphasis, first-person POV, and mission level structure. It features more RPG elements than Dishonored, blurring the line with inventory management and augmentations in addition to skill points. There are also semi-open areas that are more for NPC interaction to collect quests. Accuracy is based on skill points, and requires staying on an enemy for a while to make accuracy more precise (therefore encouraging more deliberate, stealthy takes).\n\nLevel designs feature primary and secondary goals like Thief, with no explicit objective markers. Instead you pick up scattered notes that allow you to piece up clues. I really like this approach to gameplay. Even though I would often get lost, I could still resort to a walkthrough, and I would rather this freedom be possible than were the game to be too streamlined. Levels also feature a hub. Choices can also impact the whole story: you can kill Lebedev or Anna for example.\n\nStealth. Lots of Thief inspirations but under their own spin, for example, lighting with flashlight and tech goggles; disable security camera, autoguns, reprogramming bots with the lockpick and multitool (which I'm a big fan of; +1 to environment interaction and limited uses); guard alert isn't global so you can shoot people, coupled with the fact that many enemies don't die from one hit. Unfortunately, I don't think the weapon variety is quite enough for complete stealth to be viable. The lack of one-shot melee or ranged takedowns incentivizes a more aggressive playstyle, at the least being amenable to local alerts with loud guns before alarms are sounded and one-shot melee not always working (especially for bot enemies).\n\nProgression-wise, Deus Ex features skill points, augmentations, weapon upgrades, and augmentation upgrades.  There are plenty weapon upgrades (and just a handful of skills) that it encourages commiting to certain weapons as a build. I'm okay with just how powerful the Laser mod is in perfect accuracy: it makes up for the rest of the game's poor weapon accuracy makes up, particularly in early game with few skills. It does make certain weapons effectively no longer viable (e.g., Mini-Crossbow's tranq dart which takes a while; Stealth Pistol but they do benefit from no loud sound). As a completionist, it grinds my gears that trying to maximize skill points is not viable: it's not as easy as Dishonored where there are just a handful of secondary goals; there are mini things you must do as well that aren't tracked such as exploration bonuses and side quests.\n\nThe HUD ages very well. I found it highly functional, especially the way the game automatically stores important notes like passwords. The controls are awful however. Defaults for scope, laser sight, and augmentations are bad. It's also hard to figure out the optimal control scheme because there's so many buttons, particularly with weapons ranging from 1-0 and augmentations ranging from F1 to F12.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Comparing to games like Thief and Metal Gear Solid, Deus Ex looks alright for its time. The blocky 3D models especially remind me of Metal Gear Solid, although there's more detail here. Voice acting is often so bad it's good (it seems to add to the B-rated charm of the game's jank as well as the robotic monotone nature of certain characters like JC). Also no reload animations. Ingame rendered cutscenes.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ All the save scumming, especially in the first two levels. Boy was Liberty Island a mess with its open area design. And I didn't know enemies take multiple hits and loud weapons were the actually stealthy approach.\n+ Only when I was in Mission 4 (Hell's Kitchen second visit) did I realize that with my Computers trained skill, I can hack them rather than get lost trying to find the appropriate passcode in-game or otherwise find the answer online. This includes hacking ATMs.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ You can pick up bodies, probably following Thief. Nice.\n+ Loading screens are fairly seamless (and near instantaneous with a modern PC).\n+ You can skip cutscenes on a per-line basis.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ There is no selling or storing items. You simply drop them from your inventory. That simplifies matters, but this means you must get the credits currency through other means like mission completions.\n+ Torso can weirdly sometimes do more damage than headshots, unless the weapon has a specific headshot multiplier, in which case its 8xBD instead of 2xBD. Examples include Baton and Riot Prod.\n+ If you aim at someone with them just slightly angled at you, they detect. That's ridiculous.\n+ Health system is limb-based. It actually doesn't make too much of a difference (legs make you crippled when 0). A simpler HP system may work better.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ No buffer for quick saves.\n+ No explicit button for throwing grenades. It's a separate weapon you must swap to.\n+ You have to toggle on the laser mod. It doesn't stay on automatically.\n+ There are rare underwater fights, and this is the only time mini-crossbow is necessary. Very frustrating.\n+ Scope mode is a toggle, not hold for aiming down it.\n+ You can still reload at full ammo.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://deusex.fandom.com\n+ https://deusex.fandom.com/wiki/Passwords/Logins/Codes_(DX)\n+ https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Deus_Ex\n+ build | https://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/4b9v1z/dx1_skills_minmax/d17av9z/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/9j6zxl/what_order_do_i_play_the_deus_ex_games_in/\n+ damage | https://steamcommunity.com/app/6910/discussions/0/343785380898577256/\n+ weapons guide | https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=275156059\n+ setup for modern systems, using Kentie's executable and Unreal engine Direct3D 10 renderer.

I played it vanilla (Game of the Year Edition), on medium difficulty, without any mods like [GMDX or Revision which modify gameplay and level designs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/as02tz/what_do_you_recommend_for_an_og_deus_ex_first/egqtrgi). But there are reasons why GMDX may be reasonable, [significantly improving the jank](https://old.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/hdqgii/deus_ex_at_20_the_oral_history_of_a_pivotal_pc/fvmld2t). I tried to play the game blind, not worrying about missables such as augmentation cannisters, augmentation upgrade cannisters, and skill points; I only made sure I got main items for my build. However, I often got lost, so I quite regularly followed a walkthrough to find out where to go next. I stopped playing the game after Hell's Kitchen Return. There are roughly 6/14 more missions to go, and I don't care enough about boring through the janky gameplay to appreciate B-rated story.\n\nConfiguration-wise, I followed the guide above using Kentie's code. Alt-Tab support is still spotty though: If I'm in Settings and Alt-Tab, I can't exit Settings without first entering another Settings; same for Inventory; and both freeze for a few seconds. I remapped Use Object in World from Right Click to E, Lean Left/Right from Q/E to Z/C, Crouch from X to Ctrl, Reload from ; to R, Activate Inventory Screen from F1 to Tab, Quick Save from NumPad + to -, Quick Load from Numpad / to =, Leg Augmentation from F6 to Shift. Light Augmentation from F12 to F. I prefer modern controls: WASD movement, R reload, right click for scope, ctrl crouch. I use E for Interact as it's used in many games like Borderlands and Fallout and F for Flashlight like in Half-Life. I would use F5/F8 for Quick Save/Load but I can't. Similarly, I would use Alt+A/D for Lean Left/Right like Dishonored.\n\nBuild-wise, I went stealth, ranged, and lethal. Favoring being a conversationalist and hacker is unique to this series (and stealth builds are rare), so you ought to try it out. I typically prefer being nonlethal, but I don't like the nonlethal options in this game (it's missing a melee chokehold as well as MGS' tranquilizer pistol and sniper rifle which are immediate on headshot). My starting skill points trained in Computer, Electronics, Lockpicking, Weapons: Rifle. I carry a sniper rifle, sawed-off shotgun, assault rifle, and Dragon Tooth's Sword. All benefit from the same skill (I equipped mods as I went but made sure the sniper had a silencer). Early levels, I also used baton and pistol with laser mod which is especially OP for its 1-hit takedown and plentiful ammo; I only swapped it until the Assault Rifle's accuracy was good enough from skill upgrades or until I got another laser mod for it. For augmentations, I went Speed Enhancement (Legs), Regeneration (Torso 1); the rest I did willy nilly. Oftentimes I never activated the augmentations though: I only really used the Flashlight and Leg Enhancement, so I binded them to keys separate from the Function row. I wish the hotkeys were more intuitive, and some were just passive benefits.\n\nI didn't find a use for many weapons: for example, Mini Crossbow, Flare, all Grenades, Binoculars, Heavy Weapons. Sawed Off Shotgun is strictly better than Assault Shotgun because Damage per Shot is more important than DPS.",

    "date_finished": "6/29/20",
    "comments": "Baldur's Gate is the epitome of computer RPGs (CRPGs), also known as isometric RPGs. It made a significant impact on the RPG genre as a whole and especially the CRPG subgenre's direct predecessors: action RPGs like that of Diablo, RTS like that of Starcraft, and open-world western RPGs like that of Elder Scrolls. Other game influences are Deus Ex, KOTOR, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, and Divinity. Playing in 2020, I'm most impressed by the depth of its mechanics, introducing tons of ideas that still hold well today and I think would improve modern RPGs: for example, simple stat/damage formulas; strong class identity encouraging balanced party compositions; miscellaneous deep mechanics (e.g., Thief's Detect Traps); and quests without explicit objectives.\n\nFlaw-wise, BG lacks an engaging story and characters; in-depth side quests either story or gameplay-wise; generally higher quality content over featuring expansive but empty worlds; and obtuse UI. \n\n__Story.__ The story is pretty forgettable. Just enough to build a convincing world.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Building on D&D, boy is Baldur's Gate deep in mechanics for a video game. Character creation is particularly impressive, going beyond mainstream RPGs in 2020: race; class and class kits including dual and multi-class options; alignment (similar but different from BG's reputation); ability scores; and mage book and weapon proficiency slots. Mages and clerics have spellbooks, where similar to Dark Souls (which probably copied D&D), spells are limited by use in a day rather than MP, and you must memorize a subset from your spellbook before being able to use them. Thieves detect traps, pick locks, pickpocket NPCs, and have a stealth mode. Bards have Bard Song. Classes have Special Abilities, e.g., druids have Shapeshift, rangers have Charm Animals, Paladins have Lay on Hands and Cure Disease.\n\nOther examples of deep mechanics: You can listen to rumors by buying a drink for someone at an inn. You rent a room for healing, reducing fatigue (which increases by the number of hours the party plays without rest), and passing time. Morale can cause party members to flee combat (you can increase this with bards or becoming intoxicated, which has a tradeoff of increasing luck penalties). There are status effects such as poison, diseases, and confuse. Inventory has a carry capacity for each party member. Day and night cycle, where merchants have hours. Identify enchanted items. Cutscenes when you occasionally rest. Party members die permanently at higher difficulties; at lower difficulties, you must visit a church to resurrect them (similar to Dragon Quest). When moving across maps, you can get waylaid by enemies.\n\nThere are plentiful main and side quests. A lot of the side quests are fetch quests however and not nearly as much depth as, e.g., Fallout: New Vegas. There is some player agency here that's impressive: you can often kill or not kill as two dialogue choices, and you can pickpocket NPCs when if caught lead to fighting them alongside guards. It does not extend beyond this local interaction however, not affecting large quest chains or affecting long-term aside from a global reputation. The dialogue is just not as intricate to feel engaging: it lacks, for example, Fallout 3/NV's skill checks and quest chains that intersect depending on prior choices; as well as Witcher 3's feeling of quests having consequences.\n\nLike other CRPGs, Baldur's Gate features a real-time with pause system rather than D&D's turn-based system. Unfortunately, I don't think the system is very good. The idea of allowing you to steamroll through encounters, but also enabling you more precision by giving commands during the pause, is intriguing. Pause just seems like tedious micromanaging though, making the RTWP system a compromise that does neither real-time or turn-based best. AI script options enable automating away of this micromanaging. At temples, you can purchase spell services as well as donate.\n\nLike other 90s games, the controls and UI have not aged well. There are too many unnecesary options (e.g., Return to Game, Party AI toggle). There is map, quest journal, inventory, character stats, mage book and priest scroll, rest, character selection.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The graphics and dated UI make it tough to stomach Baldur's Gate as a video game. It feels even dated for its time, coming out at the same time as Metal Gear Solid and 3D games. I found it a bit easier by thinking of the game as a setup from D&D and board games rather than a step down from modern video games. Having voice acting for (the major) lines in the game is quite praiseworthy.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ The abrupt soundtrack shifts when moving from level to level. The abruptness of combat music, the fast speed in which it's over, and then back to normal world state. This is an RPG vibe I've had for a long time, particularly in the unpolished 2000s games like Oblivion and Witcher 1-2. Interesting to see that style last since Baldur's Gate.\n+ Trying to detect traps. It's a mess. Even with Imoen having Detect Traps automatically on whne idle, you have to take a few paces, wait until a trap is detected, and continue onwards. This is too tedious and it's simply easier to spam Quicksave, reload once you trigger a trap, and find and remove it.\n+ Spending most of my time on inventory management.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ BG's reliance on D&D mechanics makes damage formulas easy to calculate. Games like WoW make it exceedingly more complicated, making it harder to determine which stat combinations for a particular item are better (amd certainly not with a back of the envelope calculation).\n+ You can show map coordinates.\n+ Quests do not have explicit objectives.\n+ Tab highlights interactable objects.\n+ You can force open locks if your party members can't pick it open.\n+ Quick save has a buffer size of saved games.\n+ Fast travel exists, where once you enter the world map you can travel to any already seen location.\n+ Your party still moves when you zoom out to the map screen.\n+ EE has native 21:9 support, borderless, and higher resolutions.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ You manually hit a separate screen to level up.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ The hotkeys and movement commands for each party member is too much micromanaging. It's tedious even getting in and out of buildings. In addition, unlike Starcraft, you can't click to move to an area that's within the fog of war. This means you must make more myopic decisions when moving your character, requiring more micromanaging. Party pathfinding can also be infuriating.\n+ Movement speed is way too slow for the size of the world. To fix this, I raised the frame rate from 30 to 60, which also sped the game by 2x (https://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/4w6atn/raising_frame_rate_bgee/). This makes for a bit more frantic combat, so I turned on the option to pause at enemy sighted. I also made regular use of Ctrl+J's teleportation for backtracking.\n+ THAC0 and AC is very confusing. Your base armor is at 10, and items set the base armor level lower than this value (but don't necessarily stack, e.g., bracers and armor); further armor with minus modifiers can lower this even further to the ideal of 0. I found this very confusing because the general idea is that you want lowest AC, but armor describes a positive AC value. But rings may have +1 AC, which actually means one AC better not worse.\n+ The amount of companions for partying is impressive. But it's a shame they have so little story behind them. It would be better with quality over quantity.\n+ No real bank to store items. As a workaround, I used the barrel outside the Jovial Juggler in Beregost.\n+ Item descriptions don't tell you their sell value.\n+ Loot icon is very small, smaller than just clicking on an enemy's corpse. There is also no loot over multiple corpses.\n+ The color backgrounds on scrolls are never explained, and I had to figure it out myself: red means the (current) character cannot use it, green means the (current) character can learn it, blue means the scroll is unidentified.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://baldursgate.fandom.com\n+ walkthrough | http://www.forgottenwars.com/bg1\n+ best mage and cleric spells per level | http://www.forgottenwars.com/oogi/index.htm\n+ best class for first timers | https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/9.834797-Poll-First-time-Baldurs-Gate-player\n+ berserker weapon proficiencies | https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/30919/bg1-berserker-weapon-proficiency\n\nI played Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition on PC (Steam); this entry does not include the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion, which I did not play (as of this entry date). I was motivated to play BG as a classic status, ranked among the best games of all time, and because it's a major influence to series such as Planescape Torment, Deus Ex, KOTOR, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Divinity. It's been extremely difficult motivating myself to get into Baldur's gate though: the long playtime, dated UI and gameplay, and graphics turn me off. To streamline the game just a tad (especially party micromanaging) so I can focus more on the story, I played on easy difficulty which is one below normal (https://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/14tlzm/is_it_okay_to_be_playing_on_the_lowest_difficulty/). I did most side quests up until around Chapter 4 when I was more selective, looking at the loot first and otherwise proceeding directly with the main quest. I beat the game in a total of 15 hours (2X speed, easy difficulty, and focusing on Chapters 4+'s main quest contributed to the low playtime; I easily spent roughly as much time researching builds and strategies for the game).\n\nBuild-wise, I chose Dwarf, Fighter (Berserker), Chaotic Good, STR 18/DEX 18/CON 18/INT 18/ WIS 18/ CHA 18 (via Ctrl+8 cheat), and 2 two-weapon style / 2 war hammer proficiency. Long sword is also highly recommended, but I chose war hammer for novelty (not many games feature hammers as strongly as swords). Mage/spellcasters fare poorly at the start due to squishiness and magic variety, so they're not great for beginners. I also avoided Thief because you'll quickly pick up companions that are Thieves and Mages (particularly Imoen). Ranger (Archer) was the other alternative, but the CC immunities from Berserker and high health pool make it easier to steam roll (https://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/8h3qpx/questions_about_building_the_best_fighter/).\n\nParty-wise, I went with the canon party. This is not because I care most about canon (it seemed arbitrary, particularly on companions to travel with along the way) but because it simplifies decision-making. Build-wise I went:\n\n+ Imoen: Thief (role as ranged DPS), Shortbow\n+ Khalid: Fighter (role as ranged DPS), Longbow\n+ Jaheria: Fighter/Druid (role as melee DPS/healer hybrid), Quarterstaff\n+ Minsc: Ranger (role as melee DPS), 2H Sword\n+ Dynaheir: Mage (role as ranged DPS), Sling\n\nWith my character as the primary tank, this balances out to 3 melee, 3 ranged, and with utility from thievery, magic, and druid. Formation is 3x2, with main character, Minsc at front; then Jaheria, Dynaheir; then Imoen, Khalid. Relevant threads (https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/75251-baldurs-gate/51835218, https://sorcerers.net/community/threads/a-weapon-for-jaheira.21375, https://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/631y5a/how_to_keep_the_tank_in_front_and_the_best).\n\nThe walkthrough I followed is generally recommended and with visuals and plentiful hyperlinks unlike more classic text-only GameFAQS-style walkthroughs. It doesn't include EE additions however. For example, only some merchants can Identify everything (I resorted to Thalantyr in High Hedge until I figured out Dynaheir can learn it, and for all magic-related sells; I used the armor merchant in Carnival otherwise). Unlike its recommendations, I also did not go immediately for Manual of Bodily Health for the Constitution increase at level 1; it applies retroactively (at least in EE); I also only picked up party members along the way, and declined any that weren't part of the canon party.",

Gameplay-wise, I'm most surprised by how well the jump and chime mechanics work together. Sliding on the dunes and snow, as well as flying in the climax, especially feel smooth.

    "comments": "The Last of Us 2's strength is its cinematic experience, weaving a harrowing tale through a dual narrative storyline, strong characters (and the loss of them), and gameplay. It's a lengthy saga going beyond the typical movie experience, paced slowly at times to really build to its thrilling moments. Outside of its story, TLOU2 also refined TLOU's gameplay elements, offering engaging mechanics throughout the course of its 20-25 hour playtime (and that's impressive). Moreover, TLOU2 pionereed ultrarealism graphics, reigning among the top AAA games in the PS4 console generation.\n\nFlaw-wise, the diversity can be a bit too large of an agenda, distracting from the quality of the actual video game. Abbie's story should also have intersected with Ellie's story more as Abbie's is inevitably a bit weaker, leading to occasionally weak pacing. I did not find this to be as an issue as much as the anti-SJW fans however or the fans with a strong attachment to having their favorite character live. The stealth gameplay, while decent, is also elementary.\n\n__Story.__ Most of all, I love the nuance in the character interactions. The story's pacing is also quite good, going from the death of the protagonist followed by city exploration intermixed with other playable characters and flashbacks followed by Abby, and then a short timeskip to Santa Barbara for a final action-oriented climax.\n\nThe overarching morality of vengeance isn't as bad as the antifans made it. It is hamfisted here with Abby just happening to be the daughter of the top surgeon. And they specifically playout the daughter-father dynamic. And one of her friends is pregnant? PLEASE. But it's not like the game is necessarily condemning violence and vengeance. I interpret it closer to that of Oldboy: it's just people stuck in a fucked-up situation; no one in particular to blame, just reality. And people learning to overcome these harsh pressures. Although hamfisted, some of the character parallels do remain interesting from a storytelling perspective. Flashbacks of Abby with glimpses of happiness but stuck thinking about vengeance. And flashbacks of Ellie who only had happiness because of Joel's sacrifice.\n\nThe diversity of characters is okay with me to be honest: asians, big-nosed/less conventionally attractive, fat people, lesbians, bisexuals, masculine women, Jewish culture, mexicans, atheists and religious folks. It's absolutely pushing an agenda, but I'd rather it push the diversity agenda (which I actually do agree with) than the opposite of ignoring, or worse, spreading the problem. I do agree Lev being trans, and the whole shaving head as the root cause of their problems, as detracting from the main story (did not even realize that was why he shaved his head). A transgender identity crisis does not fit into this story. Playing the game, I thought Lily was just some religious term in their cult; and when Lev said that he would be married off, I thought this was simply a matriarchal cult!\n\nThere's a great point about Abby's story paralleling Joel's in TLOU1 (https://old.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/hg6yoy/the_last_of_us_part_ii_sells_more_than_4_million/fw25vx6/).\n\n__Gameplay.__ Gameplay largely follows The Last of Us, but significantly more polished in controls, new enemies, and even better animations. Stealth is the same as the original game in being fairly simplistic, but I'm a huge fan of the audio cues which give a better indicator of alert status. There are also more stealth options: for example, silencers and a stealth skill tree. Your companion can spot when an enemiy is out of your line of sight and about to spot you. I think it's particularly the movement mechanics that make the stealth feel so much more smooth than the first game. The alert is still bad though: once spotted, everyone automatically knows where you are.\n\nOn progression systems, the crafting is the same as The Last of Us. Upgrades are more streamlined, with linear skill tree paths for Survival and and the Upgrade Bench. Upgrades include new upgrade branches from magazines, pills as the skill upgrade currency, bolts as the weapon upgrade currency, and crafting materials for ammo/healing, and lore. You also pick up a large gun and small gun holster. There is a sufficiently novel set of mechanics, from weapons to swimming to new enemies like shamblers and stalkers to taking arrows out of you to a melee sequence playing as Abby, that make the game still interesting halfway through the game. I found a use for all the weapons (particularly the bow, molotov cocktail, silenced pistol, and rifle/shotgun/melee when things get hairy) but never used the Smoke Bomb or Trap Mine. Even at the end of the game they reward you with a silenced SMG as well as levels where you can unleash Infected.\n\nControls are very smooth and simple. Circle (with tap vs hold) lets you easily vary among standing, crouch, and prone positions with one button. Many interactions are either tap or hold the Interact button. L1 works well as a general-purpose run, with L2 and R2 as aim and shoot. This game's Detective Mode with R1 is among the best implementations (it only shows targets, and you can barely move). But Detective Mode is still a bad mechanic. I'm generally a fan of TLOU's D-pad based equip shortcuts; it's like Dark Souls but a bit more involved to handle more items. Way better than equipment wheels at least!\n\nThe game's pacing encourages exploration, from the cordoned-off zones in the linear levels to the more open-world areas where you can get suppleis, upgrades, collectibles, and new cutscenes/dialogue. I'm also surprised by the linear levels filled with more open shops to browse. Enemies on the beaten path, and the occasional ambush, also keeps you on your toes. Finally, I'm surprised by just how much content there is in this game. It would be excellent if it just stopped around Ellie's Seattle Day 3, with 9-10 hours of content. Abby's story substantiates the overall themes, adds a few new gameplay mechanics, and entirely new levels such as the island and bosses.\n\nEnemy variety is decent. It's paced well in introducing them across the game to keep it interesting. Most impressive is the level design variety, from suburban homes to areas like hotels and hospitals to sewers and tall grass.\n\nFollowing TLOU and Uncharted, the platforming is excellent. It's not typical video gaming platforming. Rather it's like urban parkour, with a few presses to leap over obstacles and gaps, climb walls, crouch and go prone to wiggle your way through narrow areas. You can now break glass with the throwable objects. Adds a bit more variety to the Uncharted-style platforming. Rope also comes from Uncharted 4. Short and tall grass. And yellow markers on gaps to indicate what you can get to. I'm a big fan of this style of platforming overall. Your companion helps along the way with the animations. Most impressive are the audio cues on where to go next, both from the companion and Ellie herself: I love whenever Ellie makes explicit note when she can't make a gap, or could do it but I just happened to time the jump poorly. It adds to the immersion of increased interaction between playable character and the world, which is an express goal of the platformer genre.\n\nThe mix of companions you play with, and the occasional times you're alone, are excellent. Keeps up with variety from a gameplay perspective, let alone the actual diverse story.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Presentation is stellar. I'm most impressed by the level of detail in all the semi-open linear zones such as shops and houses. They all feel lived-in and real in proportion (unlike most video game levels). Facial animations during cutscenes are particularly on par; they're closer to standard Uncharted 4 detail during the in-game rendering. The detail on their backpacks is awesome. Gameplay animations are also smooth. The story cinematics are well-detailed. There are no loading screens, seamless integrated into the animations.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ The museum flashback is cute. Tons of good quips at each other. And the mirror scene where Ellie makes faces! And building on Ellie's fascination with space.\n+ Getting ambushed when at the weapons workbench as Ellie on Seattle Day 2.\n+ The Nora scene.\n+ All the neck stabs, from the stealth kill animation to the cutscene killing the Korean woman playing the rhythm game.\n+ Abby's unarmed melee sequence.\n+ The skycraper level area. Character-defining, building on the inner flaw beyond Abby's outer strength. Not tense or interesting gameplay-wise because it was incredibly easy platforming though\n+ Day 3, going against a sniper and it hinting at being Tommy. I actually wish they did this more at connecting the two stories instead of only waiting at the last day.\n+ Stealthing through the middle of a gunfight between two factions.\n+ Choking Ellier near to death. Jesus are the scenes brutal.\n+ Still playing Abby and then Ellie in Santa Barbara? Oh my god I can't believe the game hasn't ended yet.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ You can stealth kill clickers?? What a game changer! Abby's lack of stealth kill was also fine, as I found there to be ample crafting materials for shivs.\n+ The map for the semi-open world areas use an actual map from the game. Fuck yeah. I loved that ever since Thief.\n+ I love the amount of accessibility options, from audio to visual to the detailed options for difficulty settings.\n+ The guitar playing minigame. And the song shared with Joel and Ellie. That's some feels. And Ellie's rendition on Take Me On (which is a reward for exploring!).\n+ Flicking your controller when the flashlight goes out.\n+ Taking out pieces of the weapon to upgrade it, and all those smooth animations.\n+ The two running modes, where you go full sprint when in combat.\n+ Very forgivingly placed checkpoints.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about\n\n+ Kinda weird that Seattle Day 1 had this very open area with multiple objectives, and then the rest of the game converted to a semi-linear with some open areas format. I vastly prefer the latter, with the former feeling a bit more trope-y (see also it being done from Uncharted 4 DLC). But what a weird shift.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Safes. I hate puzzle collectibles and their need of not only being easily missed but the backtracking. I think codes in general are fine, like the gate codes in Seattle which make the game a bit less automated, forcing you to read through the artifacts you collect. Fortunately safe code combinations tend to be very close to the actual safe.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI beat the game in 22 hours according to the in-game save time. I played the game on normal difficulty and mostly blind without a walkthrough. I upgraded somewhat ad hoc. I generally tried to explore every crevice but not guaranteed to have caught everything. I only looked at a walkthrough to make sure I do have the safe combination for each safe I found. I was also stuck a handful of times.\n\nI was only spoiled by a few things: Joel killed by Abby (from scrolling through reviews), Abby's sex scene, and the last part of the game being devoted to Abby (from looking at walkthroughs to see length of game).\n\nPlaying this game after Fallout, I appreciate the dynamic scripting and character interactions in Naughty Dog games. There's all sorts of effects that make this smooth and less janky than in Bethesda games: dynamic audio, so only one person speaking actually dominates, non janky animations, etc.",

    "date_finished": "6/22/20",
    "comments": "Fallout 4 is unlike any other Fallout: this is an open-world FPS with RPG elements more than an RPG. On positives, Fallout 4 improves on its previous titles with smoother gameplay and shockingly good visuals. Unfortunately, everything else is worse. Story and RPG elements are more streamlined, and this works to mixed degrees and certainly not as well as New Vegas: there is significantly less player agency from dialogue to story choices. Other major flaws include: forgettable story and characters; tedious settlement building; level scaling; bad performance; Bethesda-iconic jank in combat and animations; Fallout-style bad inventory management.\n\n__Story.__ This is the most linear RPG I've experienced from Bethesda. Unfortunately, the story is also not that interesting: the factions are each forgettable; and no characters stand out. The story largely follows the same structure as Fallout 3. At least it has sufficient worldbuilding to keep it interesting. And side quests and exploration are still there, keeping you piqued to learn lore just by going through areas (and much denser than previous games).\n\n__Gameplay.__ Gameplay is the smoothest in the series. For example, there's more real-time immersion: search through containers and corpses are real-time and the loot window appears automatically; VAT slows down instead of pauses combat; heals take time to apply and heal over time. There's also a new critical strike system. Similarly, controls are refined with a much appreciated Sprint ability (though clunky in that it's Toggle-based and does not work while strafing). You can also turn on your Pip Boy as a flashlight. Unfortunately, [combat is still not great](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/5jtrzv/fallout_4_combat_analysis_and_critique): bullet sponge enemies, limited ammo, and clunky animations still make me ultimately prefer stealth, silencers, and VATS for all combat encounters to bypass its flaws.\n\nThe RPG elements have undergone significant streamlining. Skills have been removed and merged into the perk system (e.g., lockpicking); no karma/faction reputation; no weapon durability; dialogue has reduced to four options (often two of which are yes/no) and without persuasion/speech/barter skill checks making most quests have the same outcome; no targeting healing to specific limbs; no conditions; and no explicit detailing of what dialogue choices cause morality to increase/decrease. There are no light or heavy armor choices: just armor upgrades that vary in resistances: physical, energy, radiation. On the plus, there is now weapon crafting which adds some customizability, and disassembling for materials means no item picked up is worthless. You can also enter a Power Armor as a hybrid vehicle-like mode (which I never use, but it's nice I guess). Finally, there are unique companion perks granted by companions at max affinity, perk magazines (replacing Fallout New Vegas' skill magazines), and non-SPECIAL bobbleheads.\n\nBuilding and managing settlements is a big component of Fallout 4. I hate this resource and people managing: I do enough of this at work! This feature is very out of place in the game and requires too much micromanaging. But I do like that it provides a central hub for you to do things. The workshop can also infinitely store all junk, which is a quality of life improvement.\n\nThe level designs are sufficiently diverse, but the open world has a fatal flaw: too many side quests all of which follow similar formulas. For example, all the settlement quests to clear an area; all the radiant quests. See Witcher 3 as an example of quests and open-world design that's sufficiently diverse to encourage you to visit all of them. There are too few companion quests to further their story. There ought to be fewer companions and with more quests per companion.\n\nLike other Bethesda games, Fallout 4 is a victim of level scaling. I much prefer that quests have strict level recommendations, weapons have explicit levels, zones have level ranges. I see the intention to have the full world be explorable. But the soft gating just fuzzes this concept rather than solves it, ultimately advancing an artificial difficulty of health/damage buffs instead of more fundamentally solving enemy AI and player/enemy mechanics like what a more hand-designed level system does. For example, you can't rush to get a powerful weapon early on as the picked up weapon scales with your level.\n\nIt's 2015 and I still hate Fallout's inventory management. Apparel for example is a flattened list, with no ability to compare an item to the equipped, or automatically sort by the apparel type. The DEF_UI mod is a good improvement with a clearer indicator of which item corresponds to which type via a thumbnail and grouping of items like Notes. I'm looking for something like Skyrim's SkyUI however.\n\nEnemy variety and enemy designs build on prior games and is generally excellent.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Textures are great. Lack of facial animations during dialogue is jarring. Lots of miscellaneous janky animations and scripting.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ The core loop of fast traveling to the closest location to a quest marker; clearing the area with a handful of a weapons monitoring ammo types, sneaking to loot everything; fast traveling back to Diamond City for vendoring and Sanctuary for stashing important items; repeat.\n+ Losing an hour and a half of progress due to game crashing to desktop (CTD, possibly due to Sim Settlements?) and finally loading back to a corrupt save. Fortunately, I did not make much quest progress so I just added 1000 caps, Endurance bobblehead, and 1 level to make up for this.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Lone Wanderer perk counterbalances the common approach of not having a companion as their AI is often stupid.\n+ You can track multiple quests at once. This is a huge gripe I have with many RPGs (e.g., Borderlands). I forget if this was possible in previous Fallout games.\n+ You can hold your breath when sniping.\n+ Like other Fallout games, I like that NPC conversations reveal new locations on the map. It's a good gameplay incentive to talk to people, and while not being so fully expansive as a quest per NPC.\n+ Sprint endurance is given by AP.\n+ Ammo capacity is unlimited. So youâre not cucked by reaching max ammo on a certaint type that you use less and forcing you to do a hard swap to use weapons of that type. Instead, the ammo capcity is more of a soft encouragement as you quickly run out of ammo for types you do use.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Instead of a wait button, you now have to sit in furniture similar to previous Fallout's requirement to sleep in order to get a rest XP bonus.\n+ The green color for the HUD and VaultBoy works well for the theme but isn't the most readable. Fortunately there's an option to change the color which I did to white.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ The ability to skip dialogue lines with the Mouse button is extremely inconsistent as you can sometimes shoot the person. And you can exit the conversation if you're a few feet too far away. I hate this so much. Similarly, you can enter and exit dialog camera, panning back to the original gameplay perspective. It's pretty janky in the transition, often escaping dialog unintentionally or taking too long to enter dialog. I turned off the camera which pans to yourself.\n+ Dialogue options are paraphrased and clearly shortened to be console friendly with its D-pad shortcuts. This is so annoying that the Extended Dialogue Options mod is a must for any playthrough. There's also no clear indicator of which dialogue options advance the conversation as opposed to gathering more information.\n+ Sprint and Sneak controls are Shift/Control even though both are Toggle.\n+ The biggest city of Diamond City is pathetically the size of Megaton from Fallout 3. See Oblivion's Imperical City or any of Skyrim's cities.\n+ Performance is awful even in 2020 with a top-end PC. First, long loading times. Second, mouse is sluggish by default so I turned off mouse acceleration (https://now.avg.com/the-ultimate-fallout-4-performance-tweak-guide). Borderless also pauses game so I added bAlwaysActive=1 to unpause it (https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/3sb3aj/tweaking_tip_alt_tab_without_pausing/). Third, there's a max FPS of 60, with bugs when you try to support more than that. I got tons of FPS drops to 20 and stuttering with my default monitor's refresh rate of 75, and my cap was half my monitor's refresh rate. I tried iPresentInterval=0 to no avail (https://www.gamepur.com/guides/fallout-4-pc-error-how-to-unlock-fps-add-219-support-change-fov-mouse-acceleration-more). Setting my monitor's refresh rate to 60 fixed it (https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/1637). Fourth, like other Fallout games, there is no native 21:9 support. Fifth, alt tab borderless support is also spotty. When back in game, I'm sometimes unable to move. Then I have to hit Third Person mode, go back to First Person mode, and I can move again.\n+ So many bugs. So much jank: fautily triggering dialogue and replaying it; AI pathing; entering and exiting dialog camera.\n+ Checkpoint system remains really bad like all Fallout games.\n+ Like previous Fallout and Elder Scrolls games, you still can't respec.\n+ Companions use ammo for their non default weapon. This requires too much micromanaging since they're very ammo inefficient. Therefore it makes giving companions weapons not viable.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://fallout.fandom.com ([quests](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_4_quests)\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/FalloutMods/wiki/index\n+ http://www.fallout4map.com/, bobblehead locations | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBU4-ttGLHs\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/42965r/comprehensive_guide_to_not_destroying_factions_in/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/3siw35/i_tested_intelligence_idiot_savant_and_experience/\n\nI played on Normal difficulty. I played on Ultra settings, consistently getting 50-60 FPS. I beat the base game in 30 hours according to Steam. This entry does not include the 3 campaign DLCs: Automatron (2016), Far Harbor (2016), Nuka-World (2016). I played female to switch things up. I advanced faction quests and the main quests simultaneously, completing each faction quest until I was gated by main quest progress. This seems to be the preferred approach given the level requirements in the main and side quests. I completed all main quests, including all faction main quests up until Institutionalized where I focused on the Institute quests. I sided with the Institute as they seemed the most new at this point, and with the most content alongside Brotherhood of Steel (Minutemen have uninteresting quests after the Castle; and Railroad is forgettablt). I did not complete all side quests.\n\nAround level 20, I was fed up with the game's pacing and content. So I turned on Very Easy difficulty, tgm, player.setav speedmult, and coc for a lot of it to speed up main quest pacing.\n\n__Mods.__ I didn't play with mods for the first few hours as they didn't seem necessary in this game: there were no huge bugs for example that the Unofficial Patch fixes. The dialogue and PipBoy inventory were too annoying for me however, so I ended up adding mods. These are:\n\n+ Base: Nexus Mod Manager. Fallout 4 Script Extender (to launch from Steam, follow https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=682660057). TruBy9 Ultrawide (with default UI scaling, Extended Dialogue Interface patch; fixes HUD being stretched on 21:9). Mod Configuration Menu (for in-game options of mods below). Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch (bug fixes). Achievements (re-enable Steam achievements when mods are used).\n+ UI: Extended Dialogue Options (explicit dialogue options; indicator for dialogue cues). I couldn't get DEF_UI to work.\n+ Quality of Life: Ish's Respec Mod (to accommodate Fallout 4's lack of it; easier than console commands); Sim Settlements Three-in-One (I use City Planner, Low involvement, without a leader, Auto-Built Plot Plans set to Designer's Choice, and used Console Commands to make building City Planner desk free; to bypass Fallout 4's core micromanaging flaw); IDEK's sim settlements logistic station (with attacks at settlement with Logistics Storage Designator off and Global Collection enabled; to automate supply lines and enable a central hub that's shared and accessed in other locations via the Logistics Storage, especially useful for synchronizing settlement's workbench tax collections.\n\nFor 21:9 support, I first tried a simple solution: [I edited my resolution in Fallout4Prefs.ini in Documents](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=551069501); contrary to this guide, I didn't need to change Fallout4Prefs.ini in the Steam directory. In addition, setting bTopMostWindow=1 and bMaximizeWindow=1 did not let me Alt Tab, so I kept them at their default of 0). I also used Flawless Widescreen to prevent the HUD from scaling (it centers it at 16:9 instead) and to set my first person, third person, and weapon FOV to 100. This solution worked well, but requires Flawless Widescreen to remain open when using Fallout 4. Once I realized I'll use other mods, I switched to the TruBy9 solution instead and which also is compatible with DEF_UI.\n\n__Build.__ I played a stealth sniper, tending to prefer VATS in order to conserve ammo, and using manual when VATS has too low probability (e.g., early game and far away). This eventually just became a stealth rifleman build in order to use multiple ammo types. Early game was Righteous Authority followed by Overseer's Guardian.\n\nI followed a popular and more recent (2019) [video from VinlyicPumaGaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GcbAgrHCo): SPECIAL stats (timestamp 6:55) are 2 STR, 5 PER, 3 END, 2 CHR, 5 INT, 6 AGI, 5 LCK; major perks are Rifleman, Sneak, Ninja, Mister Sandman, Sniper, Better Criticals; minor damage perks are Action Girl, Lone Wanderer, Critical Banker, Concentrated Fire, Bloody Mess, Black Widow, Grim Reaper's Sprint, Four Leaf Clover, Penetrator, Gun Fu; utility perks are Gun Nut, Armorer; companion perks are MacCredy's Killshot, Deacon's Cloak & Dagger.\n\nI have all companions at Red Rocket since it's small.\n\nOther popular builds are the following ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout4Builds/comments/3usal7/stealth_sniper_quickest_path_to_max_damage); [VATS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout4Builds/comments/3rceje/guidebuildloner_vats_sniper); [Infiltrator guide](https://www.vg247.com/2017/12/19/fallout-4-build-guide-infilitrator) is also promising for stealth, close range, and VATS). Instead of trying to minmax SPECIAL stats, I picked up [bobbleheads and the You're SPECIAL! book as I went](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/242540).\n\n__Misc.__ Coming from playing this after Borderlands, I'm surprised just how stark the differences are between Fallout and Borderlands. Fallout is slower paced, encouraging exploration and delving into stories with ammo conservation and being mindful of resources as you loot. Borderlands is very fast-paced, more linear, features a more forgettable story, but it also has much better core FPS and looting mechanics.",

    "comments": "Borderlands TPS is like a standalone expansion pack to Borderlands 2 with new areas, classes, enemies, and story---and stylized like an Aussie spinoff. BL TPS introduces a few new additions but otherwise is the same game: Cryo replaces Slag as the fourth elemental effect (the lack of needing a second weapon to swap and apply Slag is a quality of life improvement); O2 with double jump from moon-like gravity and ground pound (these new mechanics are great, but the O2 gauge is a pain to monitor); laser weapons replace BL2's e-tech and are finally a viable weapon type; and playable characters actually have a personality.\n\nFlaw-wise, the lack of innovation in gameplay or major refinements, trite level design, lackluster story and characters, and endgame content made this a lesser entry in the series.\n\n__Story.__ Playing on the villain side with Jack as a primary character again is a great story pitch, although not advanced very far. Jack's progression from hero to villain just isn't substantiated well enough; there are no clear motivations or reasons why he must make the actions he does and no lack of regret. And no Angel! One addition I really like is that in the base game, the character you choose actually does have unique interactions and dialogue, and it goes much further than the occasional line introduced in BL2's DLCs. The Australian characters and their heavy accents are also hilarious although not quite as memorable on a per character basis as BL's main staples when they were introduced in BL1.\n\n__Gameplay.__ BL TPS plays pretty much like BL2. O2 is introdued as one of the new main mechanics, and while I liked its effect in terms of moon jumping and ground pounding, I found that monitoring O2 to be tedious. Areas feel even more linear in this game than previous, similar to the way areas are sequenced in a DLC.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Engine is the same as BL2. Really only new assets. Environment variety is also less, and areas often feel more or less indistinguishable from one area to the next. One thing I don't like about the gravity is the lack of responsiveness in any movements; the game felt less responsive, and I think they could have combated this better with, e.g., increased sound and mroe exaggerated animations.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ UVHM doesn't require the equivalent of slagging which ruined BL2's pacing compared to previous playthroughs.\n+ Moonshot (the equivalent of BL2's Eridium) has a much higher drop rate.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ TVHM automatically scales from the get-go (although still with a level range cap per mission). Hardly an improvement.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Not all available missions show up on the quest log as (undiscovered). I think it may exclude Bounty Board missions. I had to reference a mission flow page to find out what side missions were now unlocked after I beat a main mission in order to keep my levels on pace. The same issue may also have appeared in BL2.\n+ Fewer fast travel spots than BL2 (not necessarily one per area). This forces more travel and seems to unnecessarily pad the content.\n+ Moonstone chests in non-hub areas. I've accidentally paid to open the chest multiple times. That's just bad game design if previous series and the rest of this game encourages spamming E to open up every other chest.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/guide-top-gear-for-nisha/2091\n+ https://github.com/gibbed/Gibbed.BorderlandsOz\n+ https://imgur.com/user/presequelcodes\n\nI got the bundle with all DLC (Handsome Collection). I beat the base game in 15 hours (according to Steam), and at level 27. From there I used Gibbed to level to 30, added some items and moonstones, and proceeded to Claptastic. TVHM/NVHM isn't worth the time in PreSsequel given the lack of extra content (DLCs/Headhunter packs, or a wide array of side missions).\n\nFor classes, I chose Nisha. My only other main consideration is Jack. I'm a fan of aggressive run and gun gameplay with SMGs, pistols, or shotguns, active action skills, huge DPS, and some survivability. I like Nisha's dual wielding option with One for Each of Ya, wall ricochet, and tons of kill skills. Jack's action skill is more interesting to me though as aimbot for criticals and damage boost feels like easy mode, and he has better survivability with Leadership.\n\nAt endgame, my preferred loadout is Luck Cannon as default of close to mid range, Flayer for another close range when ammo constrained, Shock Pitchfork for shield bullet sponges and occasional long range, Kaneda's Laser for escaping Fight for Your Life; Haymaker for shield; Celestial Lawbringer class mod; Cryo Transfusion for grenade; Tranquility Oz kit for Oz kit. As a character up to around level 30, I prioritized Fan the Hammer. One for Each of Ya's only major con is its ammo inefficiency and the massive single target DPS of Luck Cannon helps balance that (and Fistful of Bullets' ammo capacity increase makes it OP).",

I especially like the psychology elements, enabling reactive worldbuilding in its missions similar to Tiny Tina's DLC to keep the game more dynamic. Even the same music from BL1. New weapons such as Luck Cannon and Flayer are also amazing.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Revisiting Fyrestone, but based on Claptrap's memory.\n+ The quest around unsuppressing what happened at Overlook.\n+ The platforming with jump pads and tunnels with automatic travel is much better here than in some of the space levels in the base game. None of them feel frustrating like trying to target patches of land each with a jumppad. Claptastic levels sometimes feel like Doom/Quake.\n+ The illusions in END OF LINE from the sub-subconscious area. It goes even further in Tina Tina's DLC of dynamic worldbuilding and illusions, which is one of the DLC's greatest strengths.\n\nI played the game on NVHM around level 30.",

    "comments": "The Last of Us' greatest strength is its well-developed characters, each with various motivations and mannerisms. On top of this is an excellent cinematic presentation that seamlessly incorporates storytelling with gameplay. Unfortunately, the zombie story is trope-y, falling into standard conflicts that I feel like I've seen a million times. And the core gameplay is mediocre: clunky third-person FPS and stealth, poor enemy variety and enemy design (particularly the zombies).\n\n__Story.__ Clearly one of the better stories in the medium. It tells of a single father carrying forward after the death of his daughter. And it tells it so well through the cinematic cutscenes and various interactive elements in the gameplay. Very well-paced.\n\nZombie apocalypses are a tired trope. I still enjoy the characters, but the story premise and scene-to-scene of traversing through tired America did not pique my interest. I can't tell if it's a particular deja vu from The Walking Dead or because I watched The Last of Us many years ago: the hunters. The overarching cure story and its failures. Cannibals and kidnapping. A black man and his son or younger brother as a temporary companion.\n\nI'm hesitant about the diversity elements in the story. I'm totally fine with them existing, but they appear so regularly that it feels off in term s of realism: the first companion Bill they run into is in fact gay; so is Ellie; and the Pittsburg companions are black.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Platforming, stealth, some gunplay just like Uncharted. Unique to this game is the survival element with limited resources for healing and ammunition, crafting system, and level designs encouraging one to being more methodical in action and stealth. I especially the increased amount of stealth actions, and the ability to do nonlethal (default with strangling) or faster lethal but limited action. The game doesnât fully allow nonlethal takedowns through the game, and the stealth mechanics are fairly rudimentary (limited environment interaction, guard alerts).\n\nThe most clunky part of the gameplay is easily its aiming and weaponry. They all feel forgettable, and itâs terribly annoying aiming for headshots. Easy difficultyâs lock on aiming made the game so much more comfortable. Melee takedowns is also just a button mash. Listen/hearing mode is a cheap Batman-style detective mode, and I hate it so I simply donât use it for the immersion. Clunky gameplay can be fine in an action game like Uncharted but I find it too constraining in a quasi-horror action stealth game. I also detest the water sections.\n\nEnemy designs are also forgettable.\n\nLike the Uncharted series, Last of Us is checkpoint-based which I greatly enjoy over manual save points for cinematic games. Collectibles encourage exploration and are typically not necessary for the gameplay: the one exception are training manuals which are used to upgrade crafting items, gears which upgrade weapons, and supplements which upgrade skills. Theyâre not strictly necessary to beat the game but I dislike having to find them.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__\n\nBig fan of the fluid animations. Even various deathscenes are uniquely animated. Graphics look pretty good (I played the Remastered version). The drab colors work.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ The L3 control to zoom onto occasional visuals. Adds to the gameâs direction.\n+ The Triangle control to hear extra dialogue when you occasionally get close to a character.\n+ The Restart Encounter option tells how long ago the checkpoint was.\n\nDetails Iâm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Cover system is automatic instead of manual.\n\nDetails I donât like:\n\n+ I hate clicker enemies. They can only be killed stealthily with Shivs and are therefore something you should avoid rather than take down like other enemies.\n+ You canât stealth or silence enemies from the front. Once an enemy sees you, itâs instant alert for the full area like a MGS1 PlayStation game; no room for silencing the enemy first.\n+ Your flashlight can be seen by humans but not runners.\n+ Ellieâs face model resembling Ellen Page despite not getting the copyright.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Training_Manuals\n\nI played the remastered version on PlayStation 4. I previously watched a full cinematic playthrough in 2015. Playing this in 2020, Iâm reminded of some details through the game when I watched it. I ended up playing until Escape the City part of Pittsburgh where you meet Henry and Sam. I'm getting too much of a deja vu playing the game, and recalling bits and pieces of dialogue as well as high-level plot points. I feel like I have a good understanding of the game now. Similar to Uncharted, I played on normal difficulty. This is what the game is most designed for, and itâs really about the story and not so much the challenge of gameplay. I ended up switching to easy difficulty as the gameplay felt tedious. Since I played Easy, I prioritized Weapon Sway and Maximum Health as my skills; and just upgraded weapons randomly.",

    "date_finished": "6/9/20",
    "comments": "WoW Classic excels most in its social element. It excels so well that people would commit their lives to the game like no other video game can. There are many details that add to this. For examples: no flying mounts so you always encounter others as you travel (and can get ganked/helped with during quests and mining); no sharding so you see the same people everytime as you play within a realm; no LFG and teleportation so if you join a group and your tank sucks, everyone must bear through it as the time investment to get there is so much more. WoW Classic also excelled in its open world, lore details, inventing a decent cooldown-based combat system, popularizing the endgame system of PvP world/duels/arenas/battlegrounds and PvE dungeons/raids, auction-based currency system, professions, and gear and talent tree.\n\nIts flaws are its grindy leveling with the major focus on endgame; itemization; world buffs; aged cooldown-based combat; basic PvP system; and easy raid difficulty in 2020. The most controversial change on top of Classic is layering (sharding). While this stabilizes servers and enemy spawns, this ruins the community as effectively everyone is an NPC. There's no chance you'll see the same random again whereas it was much more common in vanilla, and that was part of the experience: acquaintances. Apparently this will only happen temporarily for the launch. Fortunately, this was removed later into the game.\n\nItâs been maybe since January 2020 that I've just been raid loggin, but now with the main tank Csmash leaving (and offtank Lanski saying he'll leave in 2-3 weeks last week), I feel no longer interested in playing the game. Every week feels like clocking in the hours: roughly 2 hours for world buff preparation, 1 hour for maintenance such as enchants and consumables, and 4-5 hours of raiding/monitoring discord. I think modern classic WoW is too overoptimized, with the community focused on optimal itemization and parsing (especially world buff preparation). I also didnât really enjoy the social community: WoW and perhaps as with all internet communities is filled with unintelligent, unemployed spergs that enjoy raging and degeneracy. Iâm just not a fan of online play, hence why I never really even delved into classic WoW PvP. if I were to play, Iâd much prefer people like my coworkers in terms of intellience and social aptitude (this plays a role particularly in raid management and guild leadership). New content since the first launch is too incremental and really not mechanically interesting: a new raid every couple of months and a few items; thatâs it. Ultimately, Iâd rather spend my weekly time to other obligations (e.g., work, other video games).\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ No cross server. One of the highlights of WoW for me is not necessarily friends, but acquaintances you see appear again as you roam about in the world (https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cz7fld/the_beauty_of_not_having_crossserver/). I saw this particularly in seeing over and over again people I grinded dungeons with at level 30/40 with SM/ZF again in 60 dungeons and comparing how far they've gotten in their gear.\n+ Keys. People get known on servers/guilds for having keys to open, e.g., UBRS.\n+ I like that weapon speeds actually matter. For example, Mortal Strike scales with weapon damage, so warriors should get slow but high damage weapons so their abilities do more DPS. I completely agree with Asmongold however that it only really worked in favor of slow but high damage weapons and no weak but slow damage weapons (10:15 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yunGdyoz5_s). The one exception are fast offhands for Rogues for poison application. C.f. Dark Souls where both were viable.\n+ Weapon skills. You also have to go to major cities to learn them.\n+ For best-in-slot gear, you need get a total of 9% hit cap. This reminds me of PoE's elemental resistance caps in that there isn't a universal best-in-slot per say. Rather, you adjust your items according to reaching certain global stats, which makes equipment more meaningful as they factor in globally.\n+ Utility items like Skull of Impending Doom enhance PvP (including duels). I love the idea of questing/crafting for otherwise random items, and accumulating all these gadgets through the world, and having them be viable for end-game content. This captures what makes MMOs unique from other competitive genres as grinding/preparation is a part of the competition itself.\n+ There's only three main ways to level (e.g., no leveling by PvP): grinding, questing, dungeon grinding. Questing also forces you to visit every zone. It's not enough and even then you'll need to grind mobs.\n+ Best in slot gear. That's what's sorely missing from the RNG of titan/warforged items in modern WoW.\n+ To buy other racial mounts, you need to be exalted to train a specific skill in riding the mount type. This adds a lot more identity to races similar to how classes actually have an identity in classic WoW. Same with getting your rings, then shoulderpads, then helmet, then trinkets as you level. And having a weapon upgrade path for warriors as you level.\n+ The best way to find people is not necessarily through world but by doing \"/who priest 56-59\" and whispering them directly. Feels more personal!\n+ You can Fear people's mobs if they steal from you so they get even more. :) https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/czgync/lpt_use_fear_to_punish_players_who_behave_poorly/\n+ No resilience stat. PvE gear applies to PvP gear and vice-versa.\n+ In classic unlike vanilla, raid BoPs are tradeable until they are equipped. This avoids the middle man of having to raise a ticket when there's a mistake during master looting.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Zone hopping is very much a thing (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2417681-Zone-Hopping-For-Quests). In more modern versions, zones are self-contained and can be completed in one go for leveling. In classic, a zone has such wide level ranges and not enough quests that I had to change often between Barrens and Silverpine Forest, and Ashenvale, Stonevalley Mountains, and Thousand Needles.\n+ All the consumables required to raid, slowly whittling your gold. It's more immersive, but it's also a nuisance to maintain.\n+ Disnenchanting has no level requirement unlike in TBC.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ COD is up to 30 days. https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/1869252044\n+ It's WoW just starting out, and you can see it in how wonky the itemization is. Tier pieces for pre-raid and Phase 1 raid are not BiS. It's often miscellaneous rare items.\n+ You look like a clown when wearing a number of bright color items. Guild Wars 2 does this best.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/faerlina/Neural\n+ classic content plan | https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-pvp-content-plan/146049\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/ | community and news\n+ https://worldofwarcraft.com/ | armory\n+ http://www.classic.wowhead.com/ | guides and items\n+ https://wow.gamepedia.com/ | wiki\n+ raid parses | https://classic.warcraftlogs.com\n+ http://www.wowprogress.com | raiding and progress\n+ https://www.wow-professions.com | profession guides\n+ https://www.curseforge.com/wow/ | addons\n+ https://www.worldofwargraphs.com | statistics\n+ https://realmpop.com/ | realm statistics\n+ https://www.avoidstreamers.com/\n+ class tiers in vanilla | https://www.reddit.com/r/lightshope/comments/9n7fb9/new_to_classic_wow_is_there_a_class_tier_list/e7n4w02/\n+ class guides (https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b5mh0e/wow_classic_class_guides_resources/, Kargoz's guide (all classes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0OMrgWBNK4), WoWHead (https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-leveling-classic-wow))\n+ average /played time to level 60 is 10-15 days | https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/biytnm/how_long_does_it_take_to_get_to_level_60_in_wow/, https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a5d07v/xphr_benchmarks/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/biyekn/what_small_or_seemingly_insignificant_thing_are/\n+ warrior dueling guide | https://www.wowhead.com/forums&topic=15459\n+ rogue dueling guide which I think I actually followed long ago | https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-guides/124867-guide-rogue-dueling-guide-proper.html\n+ how to link item in macro | https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/13686809451\n+ item restoration | https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/34576\n+ people to follow | madseasonshow, asmongold, sodapoppin, bellular, hirumaredx\n\nI deliberated on whether to make this its own entry. I decided to for several reasons: 1. so I don't forget to start playing this in summer 2019 and when there's all community and Twitch hype; 2. I can make long comment contents about a separate entry; 3. I can evaluate it as a standalone expansion.\n\n## On Class and Faction to Play\n\n(When actually playing WoW Classic, watch PvP videos and duel guides to finalize decision. This gives the most informed opinion of mechanics as team pvp will be micro instances pf duels; and PvE are all simple rotations with occasional cooldowns.) I decided to play an Male Orc Warrior. Below were my considerations.\n\n__Rogue.__ I love the class. PvE-wise, I like the simple-but-fun DPS rotation and topping DPS charts. PvP-wise, I like the ability to run solo in BGs for top killing blows and 2v2/3v3 arenas with mages and priests. Burst damage and cooldowns/CC management is one of the most fun and complex classes: Sap, Cheap Shot, Kidney Shot, Gouge, Garotte, Blind, Vanish, Stealth, Sprint, Evasion, Poisons, Distract (see Mute, creater of World of Roguecraft https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FEqw2rkgE4 and Grim in the Total Annihiation video; similar goes for Mages with Engineering for their kite ability). It's defined my WoW career. Specialty classes like Rogues and Mages are also better than hybrids for both PvE and PvP (\"hybrid tax\" with the exception of Fury/Protection Warriors). I also love the ability to zoom through quests by stealthing through mobs to get at the elite or specific items. Con-wise, rogue is just more of what I already know (although spun for vanilla rather than the non-scripted TBC that I played); and there's no leadership tank/heal role so I'll never have the chance to lead dungeons/raids if I want to.\n\n__Female Human/Male Orc Warrior.__ The meta-appeal of best DPS and best tank is hard to get away from; not only are you really good at a specific specialization, but also have the hybrid variety of two roles. It won't be difficult to find a role in raids/dungeons or battlegrounds/arena sans being the most popular class. Appealing to the meta is critical for vanilla WoW as players must actively decide whether to play with you; it's a power dynamic. PvE-wise, it offers top DPS, the ability to lead dungeons as a tank with friends or offtank raids, and extra loot for an offspec. PvP-wise, a tank is bad (and boring) unless you have a healer in battlegrounds; Fury can be fun but is not as bursty as rogues (which to me is a con, but also a different playstyle to experience). One con is very bad leveling. I decided on Orc for the top or near top PvE DPS, PvE tank, and PvP. You get Axe Specialization for DPS and threat generation; Blood Fury for active DPS racial; and Hardiness for 25% stun resist. I used Arms for leveling. This video has a good detailed breakdown (https://youtu.be/u83izVZzFvE).\n\n__Mage.__ 1. novelty as I haven't played the class before (negated with my experience on Atlantiss Netherwing private server); 2. best ranged DPS with a bursty damage and CC role like rogues.\n\n__Night Elf/Tauren Druid.__ 1. Novelty as I haven't played the class before; 2. PvE group variety as I can also play a healer in raids (and even off tank), but as a Restoration healer you're worse than in HPS than Priests, Shamans, and Paladins but needed for the strongest HoTs in the game, and nobody wants Feral DPS (non-bursty sustainable damage swapping between forms); 3. lackluster arena PvP but good flagrunners in battlegrounds (https://www.reddit.com/r/Nostalrius/comments/5of9e6/are_druids_really_that_worthless/dcj3woh/). Best DPS is Warrior spamming Execute and Mage spamming Ignite.\n\n## On Professions\n\nI chose Engineering and Mining. Engineering is a must-have for the utility and luls variety (I have fond memories of Dozer, the undead Protection/Fury Warrior from WoWCrack, and who would fuck around a lot with miscellaneous Engineering items). Mining is for making gold and synergizes well with Engineering (e.g., grenade mats). I did Mining and Skinning while leveling to 60 but did not get either very high as I dungeon spammed for leveling. I dropped Mining for Enchanting just to disenchant so I could sell mats on AH in cases it goes for more than the item vendor price. I dropped Skinning and powerleveled Engineering via auction house and hoarding mats I collected in my bank (https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/agzy7e/what_will_be_the_most_popular_professions/).\n\nMMOs are a dying genre, and WoW Classic may very well be the last mainstream MMO of all time. I better appreciate it as much as I can!\n\n## On Addons\n\nThird-party tool-wise, I used Twitch to manage my addons.\n\nFor leveling, I also used the Zygor client. I tried to keep my addon setup minimal (such as the default UI and bags), only adding items as must-haves for quality of life during leveling. This tries to maintain the classic experience and where I can optimize later with addons at endgame. Following are roughly ordered by importance.\n\n+ Change interface/keybindings for larger camera view, strafe left/right, no backpedal, toggle autorun, numbers in player/enemy frames.\n+ atlas classic wow (dungeon maps)\n+ atlasloot (ingame loot for easy look-up and equip comparison)\n+ auction faster (buy/sell based on stacks, sort by buyout price)\n+ classiccastbars (see enemy's cast bar)\n+ deadly boss mods classic (vital for pve)\n+ details (vital for pve)\n+ mapster (fog of war removal, non-fullscren map)\n+ prat (chat to include timestamps and repeating last message)\n+ quartz (includes time on cast bar and weapon swing timer)\n+ questie (to point out quest locations)\n+ real mob health (see target HP)\n+ selljunk (manual install)\n+ vendor price (see item vendor price)\n+ xptracker (to track efficiency of xp for quests/dungeon grinding)\n+ zygor (quest guide, manual install)\n\nFor endgame, my addons are similar to my Battle for Azeroth setup:\n\n+ atlas classic wow (dungeon maps)\n+ atlasloot (ingame loot)\n+ auction faster (buy/sell based on stacks, sort by buyout price)\n+ classicthreatmeter (threat meter)\n+ deadly boss mods classic (damage/heal/etc. meters)\n+ details (vital for pve)\n+ elvui (ui, includes autorepair, autosell junk)\n+ gearmenu (for managing on-use gear and trinkets)\n+ inflight (flight timer)\n+ itemrack classic (equipment manager for dps vs tank gear)\n+ questie (to point out quest locations)\n+ mikscrollingbattletext\n+ real mob health (see target HP)\n+ vendor price (see item vendor price)\n+ gtfo (dungeon aoe areas)\n+ inflight taxi timer (taxi estimated time)\n+ mapster (fog of war removal)\n+ spy (stealth)\n+ tomtom (set waypoints for map coordinates)\n\n## On Leveling Guides\n\nLeveling guides are desirable over quest waypoint addons and vanilla leveling. Quest waypoints only show paths for existing quests, not an optimal route for completing a zone and what quests to skip. Leveling guides as addons are the best version: unlike a text website, an addon benefits from no-alt tabbing, dynamically changing dependent on where and what level you are, waypoint arrow with a taxi system (the arrow tells you to use Hearthstone, Flightmaster, Boat, running, etc.), and 3D model viewer to find the quest giver. Leveling guides also show you when to grind and when to make locations your new home for hearthstone. One con is that the more popular a leveling guide, the more likely it will be camped and therefore harder to go through the quests (paid guides will actually make this easier). This is also true for reputation. This is not true for profession guides (you either do it while leveling or just level via purchasing all mats from the auction house) or gold and build guides (all the good ones are free).\n\nAmong the popular leveling guides, all are roughly equal in terms of pathing. I'm okay with paying; I care most about features. Joana's is most popular, but it's $5/mo. as of Aug 2019 and is text with a poor website design. Zygor's is $7.99/mo. as of Aug 2019 and has an addon. Dugi also has a leveling addon and is $37 as of Aug 2019 (https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cul6qk/dugizygor_classic_guide_costs_37/). See http://dugi-vs-zygor.com/. I chose Zygor only because it's more popular. I used Zygor (and dungeons) for 1-30, then grinded Scarlet Monastery (SM) to 44, then grinded Zul'Farrak (ZF) until 53 (there were no good/consistent ST groups/BRD arena groups; too much downtime), ST until 55 (I got lucky with some guildies), Lower Blackrock Spire (LBRS) until 58, LBRS and pre-raid bis gear grind until 60.\n\nI found Zygor a huge quality-of-life improvement over Questie-style addons in prescriptively telling where to make my inn hearthstone, what zones to go to, which quests to take and how to path them. And miscellaneous things like Auto-Equip leveling items and Auto-accept/complete quests. One major flaw however is that Zygor only works well with Zygor. If you deviate from the path by removing certain steps (e.g., a step is too costly because everyone is trying to farming the spawn point of an elite; or you want to try dungeons for content/gear/asking a mage for food), then it screws up the rest of your guide. Many of the quests are based on chains, and the guide doesn't update when you try to abandon a chain. What I found is that you're better off using those extra steps you took as replacements for any necessary grinding and to continue with the quest chains even if they're a little too low-level for you.",

    "comments": "Borderlands 2 is where Borderlands really defines its staples. Solid core FPS gameplay. Looting and RPG mechanics (with pistols surprisingly being top tier).  Fantastic enemy designs, both in distinctive mechanics and enemy variety. Diversity teetering on the line of SJW and cringe humor, and with colors and cel-shaded art style to enhance that. Fantastic endgame. Quirky but underdeveloped characters. Fun but shallow vault-hunting story.\n\nThere are a few flaws. First, BL2 pads its endgame content too much, dragging out it under three playthroughs and OP levels, which are unbalanced and simply scale health and damage. I enjoy BL2 but not the endgame that hardcore fans spend hundreds of hours on. Second, the storytelling doesn't go quite as much depth as western RPGs like Bethesda games do. Third, the BL series' bosses leave much to be desired: they do not have movesets that can be properly avoided given timing (e.g., nonhitscan attacks, aggressive melee and timed dodges); too many attacks are unavoidable, nor are there countering mechanics.\n\n__Story.__ The story is fleshed out for the better, with more involvement of the characters. It's not so overbearing or cinematic, keeping the gameplay still at the center. I love the revisiting of all the major characters of BL1, including playable characters like Lilith. Handsome Jack is a more engaging villain than Dr. Steele who appear only a few times. Tiny Tina is the embodiment of the change BL2 takes from BL1, moving from psyochtic crazy to lolsorandom and meme crazy.\n\n__Gameplay.__ BL2 clearly plays like a more refined BL1. This is most noticeable in its level design which is significantly more diverse than BL1, incorporating winter tundras, grasslands, interiors, corporate buildings, and wastelands. Missions are also more diverse in terms of tasks (including new overall types such as escorts, NPC coop, and failable missions), and dynamic in how they change as you make progress and offer reward choices. Even side missions can offer engaging storylines which make them fun to play just for them (see this top 10 list for example; no BL1 side missions come close https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwK1q0OA2uo).\n\nGear includes more statistics including elemental damage and chance, and more mechanics. Elemental weapons are now viable (in fact, necessary at endgame). Grenade mods also have more variety making them viable endgame. Shield mods include absorption, roid, and amp damage. Weapon parts are now distinguished by manufacturer, which enables even more gear optimization. When purchasing items, the compare menu is a huge quality of life. The elemental system with Fire for flesh, Shock for shield, Corrosive for armored enemies, and Slag to boost non-Slag atttacks is a great separation.\n\nEndgame content goes further than BL1. I enjoy the added complexity and item variety, but ultimately it goes a little too far. 100% completion includes max level and OP level, gear, SDUs, and cosmetics. TVHM (Playthrough 2) involves new enemies and UVHM involves unique loot (e.g., Bone of the Ancients, Pearlescent rarity). There are also many more side missions to finish, DLCs, OP levels, and raid bosses. BL2 also introduces UVHM (Playthrough 3) which starts level scaled and can be arbitrarily reset at any point. As a challenge mode, UVHM forces you to use the limits of the game (e.g., slag and Grog Nozzle for healing). Unfortunately, OP levels are poorly implemented and add to unnecessary level inflation: you should not need to complete 2-3 playthroughs, grind to level 80, and then grind 10 more Overpower levels to get max gear. OP levels would be better if they didn't offer better gear while still providing the challenge content, and like Borderlands 3, UVHM's features should replace TVHM. [OP levels are also not balanced](https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/2ncrj2/did_you_think_overpower_levels_was_a_good_idea/cmcwceq). Finally, [BL2's endgame loot grinding lacks as an action RPG](https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1n103l/is_anyone_else_kinda_disappointed_with_bl2_endgame/ccejwpu/), based on farming chests and bosses for legendary gear with static stats: there is no incentive to fight mobs similar to Diablo 2's magic find system as the approach for dropping gear; and legendaries do not have RNG modifiers\n\nProgression is mostly the same as BL1. The new Badass Rank system replaces weapon proficiencies, which is independent of the weapon type and applies to all characters in your profile, based on completed challenges rather than BL1's approach of rewarding XP. The Black Market with Eridium currency replaces Claptrap rescue missions as a way to get backpack SDUs and ammo shops' inventory as a way to get ammo SDUs. I think this approach is a significantly better method to max out SDUs than the potential missables that Claptrap rescue missions are. In addition to a bank being core to the game from BL1's DLC, Claptrap's stash also allows you to store items to transfer across characters. However, it diminishes the value of cash as there's no use outside of restocking on ammo and the rare vendor purchase. It would be better if these two currencies just combined.\n\nCore controls and HUD are the same as BL1 and operate just as smoothly. First time series has a minimap. You can now operate ladders, and switch seats and honk in a vehicle. Vehicles feel more weighty, and they actually have survivability and sufficient DPS with their turret, not being too OP in running things over. Armored enemies have a yellow HP bar, meaning you can tell vulnerability from the three elements Fire, Corrosion, Shock by the color of the bar.\n\nBL2 introduces a hub, Sanctuary. I think this works significantly better than the barren towns of Fyrestone and New Haven in BL1, where NPCs barely served a purpose and the place was desolate. BL2 feels slightly more alive with NPCs offering quests, different shops open, and NPCs wandering around.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Graphics look excellent for 2012; it ages well.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Only now on May 31 after completing BL1 and 7 hours into BL2 did I realize that loot chests don't require any payment to get the item. The price noted on them is the sell price.\n+ Claptrap's birthday party.\n+ Clan Wars: Zafords vs Hodunks. Nowhere near the story depth of Fallout games. But it's still hilarious how neither party suspects you started it all. I only wished they actually made the sides distinctive in development so selecting a side makes sense outside of reward incentives. I never completed the mission so I could farm both bosses.\n+ Face McShooty. Now this is BL humor I enjoy.\n+ The ridiculous DPS that Cloud Skill offers at level 22. It makes at the least all of NVHM a sudden cakewalk. That's fine for me as I want to zoom by NVHM as much as possible as I still have 2 more playthroughs, and the later the playthrough is, the better.\n+ Grooving to some of the excellent electric beat music like in Fink's Slaughterhouse or select areas of Captain Scarlett DLC. Putting music volume higher than sound effects and dialogue volume works really well. And playing Fink's Slaughterhouse arena with an SMG like it's Doom.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Unlike Borderlands 1, when class mods are attached, you can see their boost on skill levels in the skill tree.\n+ There are some outlet to spend all your money: slot machines for eridium; and tipping Moxxi. Neither is efficient in the long run for eridium/loot farming however.\n+ Upon respawn from death, you get more ammo.\n+ Bullets actually hit at the crosshair unlike in BL1 where it depends on the crosshair.\n+ Native 21:9 support. And FOV slider, which like BL1 I changed from the default of 90 to 110.\n+ Love that the opening sequence, including booting up HUD, is the same as BL1.\n+ BL1's on-use medkits no longer exist, which is good since they never worked well with the pacing anyways.\n+ Quests now offer you reward choices and optional bonus objectives.\n+ Minimap signals if you're on the wrong vertical dimension by signalling an up/down arrow when you're naer.\n+ NPC turrets are now as powerful and immediately lock onto you.\n+ The game explains more mechanics than in BL1, such as missions to teach you elemental types and E-tech guns.\n+ Rocket launchers are now viable DPS. They're in fact the best for obtaining Second Wind.\n+ Fast Travel list includes a geography map, providing a better sense that there's a world you're traversing.\n+ You can put missions on an ignore list. This makes it extremely easy to focus on just DLC quests in UVHM, ignoring all base story missions.\n+ Native 21:9 support.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Map is fog of war.\n+ Unlike BL1, fast travel locations are not preserved across playthroughs. I like that fog of war is at least, and that you do recover your fast travel spots if you enter the zone so you don't explicitly have to journey to specific spots.\n+ It's interesting playing this immediately after BL1. You can immediately tell that actions like reload speed and moving while aiming down sights feel weightier (slower) for the default weapon (assault rifle). It's not common to have a weapon take 3.6 seconds for reloading.\n+ Unlike BL1, you can't tell the distance to the mission objective.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Missions scale to the level that you accept them, not your current level. This is annoying in all 3 playthroughs: it forces you to wait until you beat the game before collecting them all, as otherwise unique mission rewards will not be max level.\n+ In the endgame, there's too much loot, where you often don't care about the green/blues because you don't need vendor money. A loot filter is a useful hotfix for this in ARPGs although the amount of loot isn't as bad as there. Ideally there's no need for all this loot though.\n+ Machine/repeater pistol, pistol, and revolvers are combined into one weapon type.\n+ The DLC may be great, but there's too many fucking DLC and microtransactions. I strongly prefer fewer and large expansions that seamlessly connect to the base game and improve the core experience.\n+ My game crashes whenever I go through The Man Who Would be Jack. In addition to the few checkpoints in the map, I've lost progress on Opportunity's side missions twice in NVHM and once in TVHM. Extremely frustrating.\n+ I don't like that in UVHM, youâre forced to slag everything. It halts the pacing.\n+ Timed missions. Kills pacing.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands2\n+ save editor | https://mentalmars.com/guides/borderlands-2-save-file-editor-by-gibbed/\n+ gibbed codes | https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1522748339\n+ maya top tier gear | https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/top-gear-for-maya-the-siren/46185#grenade\n+ maya skill guide | https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/ddd-guide-mayas-skills-for-dummies/466327\n+ maya endgame examples | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YWXaV2Axfk, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phAc4RXGEZ4\n+ weapon parts guide | https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands2/comments/4bhecw/infographics_for_weapon_parts_and_their_effects/\n+ manufacturers ranking | https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/8a3raq/borderlands_2_ultimate_ranking_of_gun/\n+ unique mission rewards, to save after level scaling is active | https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1wsnks/tvhm_side_quest_help/cf51ezb/\n+ multiple bad touch per playthrough | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-Jlod49y7I\n\nI got the bundle with all DLC (Handsome Collection), including the Ultra HD Texture Pack released in 2019. This entry's evaluation does not include the main DLC (campaigns and headhunter packs; it does include updates such as new characters and the two arena DLCs). I completed NVHM in 22 hours at level 30; TVHM in a total of 44 hours; and UVHM never completely in the base game as it already scales (total as of 6/9/20 from Steam is 62 hours). Note Epic Games Launcher gave The Handsom Collection out for free in May 2020, but it doesn't come with the last DLC (Commander Lilith & the Fight for Sanctuary) and which isn't available yet on Epic Games Launcher.\n\nSimilar to BL1's ideal playthrough, I played the base game and left DLC until enemies always scale levels with you. Otherwise, you overlevel the main missions and don't enjoy the base game's side mission content. In BL2, unrestricted level scaling happens once you enter UVHM (Playthrough 3). Starting TVHM, I completed main missions, any side missions I did not already experience to level up, and DLC whenever I already experienced the available side missions. Starting UVHM, I grinded to max level of 80 and for loot, then completed remaining campaign DLCs, then raid bosses. I did not grind for OP level 10.\n\nFor classes, I chose Maya. Only two interested me in terms of action skills and specialization: Maya and Zer0. They have more unique action skills/specializations that differ from typical FPS games (Salvador reminds me of Wolfenstein; Krieg Doom; Axton and Gaige's passive ability is boring). I chose Maya as Zer0's playstyle is very much like Mordecai both in specialization and glass cannon (only a better action skill). I'd like to try a non-sniper or pistol weapon set (in particular, her gear bonuses on SMGs), an actual action skill, elemental weapons, and more survivability and movement speed. The possibility to make Maya have a fleet build for maximum movement speed also piques my interest. Maya's versatility on weapon sets in the early game lets me also experiment with all of them and complete Badass challenges. She also has a few other diverse and strong builds: Phaselock build; healing/coopbuild; and pure DPS build. With Maya, I looked at some guides to get a sense of good skills and worked my own route to experiment with them. For Eridium, I prioritized inventory space followed by my most used weapon types.\n\nMy favorite endgame build is aggressive and close-to-mid range. I build on the momentum of chaining kills for damage and health, using Phaselock on cooldown, Fleet-based, and Phaselock, Grog Nozzle, or Grenade for slag. I love Maya's SMG run and gun style; it feels hectic like Doom and Wolfenstein and not a cover shooter.\n\nBuild is here (https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/slif-ones-fleeting-trickster-build/2717890, https://bl2skills.com/siren.html#055551250055055000103550510511, https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/build-blurred-trickster-maya/98262). The weapon set is Fire Bitch (+Damage, Maliwan grip, Hyperion stock, Hyperion sights), Unkempt Harold (+Damage, Torgue grip, Torgue sight), Corrosive Conference Call, Grog Nozzle (+Fire Rate); and Norfleet, Fire/Shock/Corrosive Pimpernel, Shock Sand Hawk, Corrosive Butcher (+Pellets, Hyperion grip, Hyperion stock, Hyperion sight), Slagga (+Fire Rate, Bandit grip, Bandit stock), Alkaline Bee as backup. The shield is Rough Rider, the class mod is purple Blurred Trickster, the grenade mod is Slag Sticky Longbow Transfusion, and the relic is (typically Fire) Bone of the Ancients. I don't enjoy the Sand Hawk because it has slow bullet speed, is ammo inefficient, requires ADS, and does not encourage precise shots; Pimpernel because it encourages mid-long range due to low fire rate and scope. One issue with my build is that Unkempt Harold does by far the most DPS, and I tend to use it as a crutch for bullet sponge difficult areas. Even though I prefer their playstyles, the Bitch is inferior to Sand Hawk and Pimpernel, Conference Call is inferior to Interfacer, and Rough Rider/Blurred Trickster is a handicap over Bee/Legendary Cat. For bosses, I tend to switch to Bee and Pimpernel.\n\nFor grinding, I like the Snowman: you can do at the start of a playthrough, it's an easy cheese, and it's awesome levels as well as loot. I used Gibbed once I got to UVHM: only when I've already gone through the process required to loot a specific item (e.g., quest chain in previous playthroughs) and I want specific modifiers; I also used it to immediately go from 50 to 80 to avoid the XP grind (I still grind for eridium).",

The story is more engaging than the first 3 DLCs featuring the ensemble cast like a miniature version of the main campaign. I like that Tiny Tina is more emotional and less lolrandom in this DLC, building off the Tiny Tina DLC's portrayal over the base game. I also like the beginning and end sequences involving an altered Sanctuary (I wish they focused more on that in the missions). However, the new characters Vaughn, Cassius, and the main villain aren't as iconic as other DLC characters like Torgue. It's not super interesting in any new mechanics or totally cool weapons either: the one new mechanic of a spore mist is never around enough that it's actually a threat. For example, having fights in mist where you must keep track of it as you fight. You just run through it. Also hilarious that one of the final areas is being able to enter the Black Market room filled with Eridium.\n\nI played at level 80 in UVHM.

    "comments": "Tiny Tina's DLC easily stands out for its engaging story. This is a meta storytelling joke I like: it's omniscient narrative over a Dungeons and Dragons style game, allowing the DLC to throw whatever at you for fun. Changing up bosses or NPCs at the flick of a switch. The characters are also revisited from the base game, but with a hilarious twist similar to having the Simpsons characters play others during Halloween episodes.\n\nTiny Tina is the only DLC that actually incentivized me to play all side missions (except for the Magic Circle of Slaughter and raid boss). I loved to see the variety in how the voice actors and quests take fun spins, and the actual engaging gameplay beyond fetch quests for mission objectives and mission progression. Like the Captain Scarlett DLC and unlike the Torgue and Hammerlock DLC, the side quests are also offered in conjunction with the main story, allowing you to complete them during your first visit rather than having to do a second visit to the area which is annoying. Some of my favorite side quests are here (MMORPGFPS, Lost Souls, Winter is a Bloody Business).\n\nNew enemies add so much more variety from skeletons to trees to knights to dragons. They're all great, although the dragon and mages can be too much of a bullet sponge (dragons in particular are not very engaging). New gear (e.g., Grog Nozzle). I like the pixie mechanic of non-aggressive that can be caught for buffs or turn aggressive.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ The opening cutscene is hilarious. Easily the best I've watched from the series' DLCs.\n\n+ MMORPGFPS and Lost Souls. Both a hilarious meta commentaries. Unlike Lost Souls, MMORPGFPS' actual quest completion is a pain though to complete specific requirements, especially if you rely on elemental damage like in UVHM and impossible with Cloud Kill.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ New vendor and resurrection messages add to the ironic fantasy spice.\n+ New to the series of distinctive (albeit generic) fantasy music. Adds more to the immersion!\n+ Pushing more on the running joke about Claptrap and opening closed doors.\n\nI played at level 80 in UVHM.",

And Baddassarus Rex ranks as one of the the most unbalanced boss in the series: too large health pool, deflects bullets, massive damage via rockets.

    "comments": "Borderlands popularized the looter shooter market. It excels as a challenging, semi-open-world action FPS with RPG elements. Most unique is its looting system and other RPG elements like leveling and quests. It has tight controls and a great execution across weapon/item variety and enemy variety. The endgame is particularly fun as your build finally starts to take shape.\n\nFlaw-wise, Borderlands can suffer a bit from balancing in terms of levels and difficulty, heavily reliant on your level and your RNG loot. The story and characters also barely exist. The semi-open-worlds are fairly barren and the same wasteland. The several bosses also don't require much strategy and are bullet sponges.\n\n__Story.__ Simple and barebones. Nothing stellar in terms of protagonists, supporting characters, or villains as they don't really exist. NPCs also only exist in the game as machine outposts handle most all services. Quests have no real story like Fallout.\n\n__Gameplay.__The core FPS loop works wonderfully, and assaulting a group of enemies enables a variety of approaches from sniping to SMG to melee. Most distinguished from other FPS are the loot mechanics, action skill, and Fight for Your Life mechanic. Non-regenerating health along with a regenerative shield follows the partial regeneration health system of predecessors like Halo and FEAR. Death penalty is fairly generous, losing just a little cash, and saves are checkpoint-based.\n\nRPG elements include RNG loot system, currency, four character classes, skill trees, inventory management, missions and side missions, weapon proficiency, SDU ammo capacity, artifacts, class mods, and challenges. Weapon variety overall is excellent, ranging in core stats like damage, fire rate, accuracy, rarity, ammo/reload speed, elemental damage, status effects, and weapon types including Eridian which have infinite ammo. I love how deep the loot system is: item rarity, manufacturers, modifiers, different weapon parts, and legendaries having unique effects.\n\nEndgame as in Playthrough 2 is really where the game picks up in pace, with endgame loot and builds really showing their diversity. Playthrough 2 however only scales loot and enemy levels and doesn't do anything new. It's only with your gear and build fleshed out that you proceed at a faster pace. Playthrough 1, especially the first half with Arid Badlands, is slow-paced and more methodical in how you approach enemies.\n\nDifficulty is quite high, particularly at the beginning when you have no good gear and no build. It's less of an issue later in the game as missions easily make you overlevelled by 1-2 levels for a given mission, which is enough to make it more palpable. Overall, however, the level balancing and careful sequencing is very important, and it's a shame that the player has to keep this in mind often. One good weapon can carry you for a very long time. I don't see why the level scaling has to be gated until Playthrough 2.5, and still not consistent as the Knoxx DLC is an exception to the scaling.\n\n Controls overall are responsive and intuitive. There's Sprint, Crouch, Jump, and numbered hotkeys for weapon swaps. Vehicle controls are also tight. The HUD is sufficiently minimal and self-explanatory (although I find the compass unnecessary; the minimap, apparently an Enhanced Edition addition, serves its job with more detail such as going around things, and the main screen points to your quest objective anyways). Auxiliary screens are also intuitive such as the inventory, quest logs, and map.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The cel-shaded graphics state an opinion, and it ages very well. I also like the wasteland setting and modern rock and punk elements.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Lining up headshots by letting enemies right in a straight line toward me, or ducking behind cover and waiting until they're more still in motion.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Autoloot. For manual loot times, holding E also acts like a vacuum. Soundtrack did not stand out.\n+ Game of the Year Enhanced Edition natively supports 21:9. With max settings and 8x antialiasing, I was able to play smoothly at my monitor's maximum 75 FPS.\n+ Single universal difficulty level.\n+ You can respec, and it's very cheap. This lets you both play without committing initially as well as explore and finetune builds at the end game.\n+ There's projectile velocity rather than immediate hitscan.\n+ Even the shield is an item, not some permanent upgrade based on a collectible like many AAA games.\n+ You can sprint and reload while sprinting. It adds to the faster pacing.\n+ Fast travel, available later on in the game for convenience once you leave Arid Badlands. I like how Catch-A-Ride is similarly an unlockable as part of the main quest line.\n+ You can spawn a vehicle at booths and automatically spawn in the driver or gunner seat.\n+ In the game menu, you can disable launcher and disable startup movies. And some HUD elements are toggleable too!\n+ The fast travel menu points out which location is the closest to the tracked mission objective (but sometimes it doesn't work).\n+ There is little to no fall damage. With the fun pacing of the game, it's nice to just jump off random things.\n+ No missable sidequests.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Bullets have travel time.\n+ Weapon types (except Eridian weapons) don't affect movement speed.\n+ It can often be faster to reload the game to reload at a checkpoint than to trek backwards.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ You can't track multiple missions at a time, making it a nuisance to recall where all the mission objectives are so you can complete them in batch as the game encourages you to do.\n+ Backpack SDUs are missable. The first five Claptrap rescue mission's rewards in Playthrough 2 are randomly Backpack SDUs which are finite in number, or a Grenade mod. This means you have to Ctrl+Alt+Delete the game if you don't get the SDU (https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Claptrap_Rescue_missions). It would be better to be consistent! To get max capacity, you also need to play the DLC on the first playthrough (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=173045786).\n+ The default mouse sensitivity was way too sensitive and default FOV of 75 felt too zoomed-in.

This entry does not include the DLCs. I played including Playthrough 2 as it seemed like a core part of the game (https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/y5mk7/second_playthrough_worth_it/). I beat Playthrough 1 in 16 hours and Playthrough 2 in a total of 22 hours according to Steam. I got all Backpack SDUs (57 capacity) excluding 3 from Playthrough 1's DLCs and 2 from Playthrough 2's DLCs. I followed the ideal build, e.g., skipping side missions in Playthrough 1 after Dahl Headlands. After I beat Playthrough 2 at level 51, I completed Knoxx. Then I grinded at Eridian Promontory to get max level and loot along the way; and Knoxx's armory farming (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlR_EUYu2_g), vault farming, and Robolution's hyperion gift shoft farming for loot. Then I completed the remaining 3 DLCs in release order: Zombie Island -> Moxxi -> Robolution.\n\nThe cons to the ideal walkthrough are threefold: you miss out on 2 Backpack SDUs from Playthrough 2's DLC which no longer appear once you enter Playthrough 2.5; by leaving out DLC from Playthrough 1, you must go through an arsenal of the same content before you experience DLC (so you must be patient); you miss out on 3 Backpack SDUs and 2 skill points from Playthrough 1. For Playthrough 2's missing SDUs, you can only enter Playthrough 2 by joining a host who is on Playthrough 2, which is effectively impossible in 2020. You can revisit Playthrough 1 once you enter Playthrough 2, but Playthrough 1's DLC will be underlevelled; so you trade that off vs Playthrough 2's starting area. I could technically deviate from the ideal playthrough by starting Zombie Island (DLC 1) followed by Robolution (DLC 4) once I hit level 42 (around when I meet Crazy Earl). The DLC is appropriate at this level, and I still benefit from 2 Backpack SDUs: the trade off is no longer having content left for Playthrough 2.5 and being overleveled for the main missions; I can ultimately mod if I care about those 2 backpack SDUs.\n\nI chose Mordecai for my class. As of May 25 2020 I really like the idea of a sniper build. Unfortunately, it's apparently not great in Borderlands 1 (https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/bax11m/playing_mordecai_solo, https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands2/comments/atsowp/sniping_in_borderlands), but I also like the secondary idea of revolver if it doesn't work out which I plan to swap to for more diversity anyways. Masher revolvers and Thanatos or Torment machine pistols synergize very well with Mordecai's Gun Crazy, encouraging a significantly more aggressive pacing, along with Equalizer and Protector for Ammo Regeneration. I played all of Playthrough 2 with a Masher and Equalizer combo I got from Playthrough 1's Destroyer loot drops. I generally like high single shot damage over high fire rate as it makes me more deliberate about aiming and consequently positioning and understanding enemy AI as I aim or reload. I'm okay with his glass cannon nature and his commitment to Revolvers and Sniper Rifles meaning I won't be able to experience other guns (but all classes encourage this specialization to weapon types, and there's weapon proficiency). I don't like Bloodwing as its passive nature makes it the least interesting of the action skills; at least it serves as a healer/crowd control in later games rather than cheap damage boost. The only alternative I was considering is Lilith, who's generally recommended for survivability and movement speed playing solo, but I'm not really into SMGs which her class best synergizes with (Phasewalk for melee aggression/retreating; and hit proc rate skills). These two endgame videos of Mordecai and Lilith by Joltzdude139 helped seal the deal (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aZTXI9Qhao, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMhVhMMJn0c). I'm not interested in melee (Brick) or turrets (Roland). In hindsight on choosing classes, I would go for Lilith as movement speed is king for more quickly rushing missions and reaching from point A to point B, thereby minimizing downtime. Mordecai is also very fragile so you can't always go in guns blazing.",

And the arena is stupidly monotonous and unforgiving: you must go through 5 rounds with 5 waves each, and on 3 different arenas jsut to beat the first mission. If you die, you must start again at the previous round.  Each round interests a new gameplay-altering rule, which is neat in principle, but it forces your character to be much more diverse in terms of his equipment and strategy than has been asked before. For example, elemental increase followed by decrease of all other damage, forcing you to have a strong elemental weapon.\n\nInterestingly, it is also the first introduction to the character Moxxi who becomes core to the series.",

    "comments": "This game excels in atmosphere and gunplay, with its Slow-mo mode and well-told enemy AI.\n\n__Story.__ A tropey story but told well through its atmosphere, flashbacks, and voicemail.\n\n__Gameplay.__ As a horror FPS, F.E.A.R. is a mix of walking around for the ambience as well as navigating environments to kill. And the FPS most shines with its distinguishing factor of Slow-mo mode, which completely changes the dynamic of FPS beyond typical cover shooters, and enemy AI. F.E.A.R. also encourages a more deliberate playstyle with its non regenerative health and finite collection of health packs.\n\nThe enemy AI is phenomenal with its ability to flank you and with their open-mic coms to tell you how they're reacting (often fake but to add to the realism such as \"We need more reinforcements!\" or \"He's trying to flank!\").  There are also many miscellaneous details such as feigning death and noticing flashlights. I think the restriction to a corridor shooter unlike the 2010-2020 trend toward open-world restricts the variability that enemy AI needs to respond to, and for the better. The level design is also a big contributor to this, with combat areas enabling multiple entrypoints and therefore giving not just you multiple angles to attack but also the enemy multiple angles to flank you.\n\nWeapon variety is okay as is the abundance of ammo and enemy variety---almost like a team deathmatch map.\n\nExploration is incentivized by picking up health boosters, which increase max health by 5 points, and reflex boosters which increase the length of the heightened awareness.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Sound design is most on point to lay out the atmosphere, with various objects in the environment moving about. Lighting is also decent with the flashlight to light up dark areas. Graphics-wise, it's hard to tell how good this level of detail is for 2005.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Slow-mo plus shotgun or assault rifle to the head is the most satisfying feeling.\n+ Only midway into Interval 9 did I realize you can swap your pistol slot for another weapon, so you have a total of 3 weapon slots.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ The tiny details in the environment interaction: shooting padlocks, shooting crates, breaking glass, turning on flashlight, hearing voicemail.\n+ The flashlight has a limit, making you be deliberate about its usage, but it also regenerates so you don't have to, for example, find flashlight batteries scattered in a level which can be tedious.\n+ I love the pinning-body-to-wall effect that the 10mm HV Penetrator has.\n+ Playing in 2020, the lack of FPS limit means I played the game consistently at 75 FPS at max settings and 3440x1440. Somewhat of a borderless mode is natively supported, as is 21:9 aspect ratio. The text such as the HUD, intro cutscene, and subtitles do not scale though and are extremely tiny (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=180211741).\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Both a manual save and checkpoint system. I tried to primarily rely on checkpoints and also quicksaved somewhat frequently when in tense areas due to the extreme difficulty.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ The movement speed is a little too slow for my taste. It would be better if the game had a sprint.\n+ Aim/Zoom is a toggle and defaulted to Shift, not Right Click.\n+ Aim/Zoom is not true iron sights, it's just a zoom-in.\n+ Steam overlay is buggy. Pressing E takes a screenshot (https://steamcommunity.com/app/21090/discussions/0/617320628135003442/).\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/fear/Boosters\n\nThis entry does not include the expansion packs Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate. I played up to and including Interval 03 at the hardest (Extreme) difficulty as the game is not terribly difficult given the Slow-mo mode. It encourages almost too cautious of a playstyle, not letting me try run-and-gun with the shotgun in fear of repercussions. So I tuned the difficulty down to normal (Moderate) difficulty. At this level, I was always at an abundance of Med Kits, including not being able to pick up new ones. I tried following a guide on my laptop to make sure I pick up all boosters in each Interval. But I don't like the drop in pacing, so I only picked up boosters as I played the game blind. By the end of the game, I had a max HP of 190 out of a total of 22 health boosters with a max HP of 199 (I can't determine what max Reflex I have).",

    "comments": "The New Colossus features solid gameplay polishing a few elements from the previous games. Unfortunately, the game's major downfall is its lack of gameplay. The story takes a frontseat, overwhelming a larger portion of the playtime with prerendered cutscenes and hub walking simulator gameplay, and the story is both inconsistent and occasionally hamfisted. In addition, the game occassionally suffers from difficulty spikes that I occasionally encountered but fortunately not nearly as much as what you hear from higher difficulties as mentioned regularly in the community. And the level designs can be repetitive featuring a sequence of commander areas.\n\n__Story.__ This game is weirdly both serious and silly for the series. It doesn't work because the storytelling is often too hamfisted and inconsistent in mood: one mission, you're headed off to execution and losing your body; another misison, you're recruiting New Orleans resistance fighters with a debate about hippy Bohevians against war; another mission, you're disguised as an actor who's auditioning to play yourself and the Hitler scene. The racist and alcoholic upbringing. Death of his mentor. Declining body and parenthood. Capture and execution. Overall, there are too many lengthy cutscenes, pre-rendered ones at that, and this interrupts the flow of gameplay.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The game operates likes its predecessors but with more polish such as increasing sprint's movement speed and reloading. There are also a few new mechanics: you can dual wield any combination of weapons; environment destruction for navigation via the Power Armor's Power Slam; contraptions (and their perks) for a tad more environment interaction. The Hatchet carries over from The Old Blood.\n\nOn weapons. There's now a SMG (technically machinepistole) for proper close combat dual wielding rather than dual assault rifle (my preferred style outside of stealth and the occasional assault rifle/sniper cover shooter). The rest of the weapons are the same. The weapons overall aren't as balanced anymore: I found it generally unnecessary to revert myself to the Bombadier and Dieselkraftwerk as the Assault Rifle with his armor-piercing rounds worked well enough, and the necessity for Diselkraftwek's platforming rarely appeared.\n\nOn progression. Instead of health/armor upgrades, there are now only weaopn upgrade kits which can you spend selectively. There are also body augments: crawl through small gaps; burst through vents; jump to high platforms.\n\nThere are two sets of side missions: Ubercommander missions and miscellaneous fetch quests that offer no rewards except for the 3 contraptor ugprades (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1188402276). Ubercommander missions are optional challenge missions reusing levels to kill a commander, and with the only gameplay incentive being the ability to replay missions to collect missed collectibles on the first playthrough, collect the two other contraptions and remaining Weapon Upgrade Kits, and achievements/trophies.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ These graphics are impressive. Lighting. Texture detail. Camera blur. Special effects. Performance is also excellent and no longer capped at 60 FPS, where I played at max settings with a consistent 75 FPS. The animations like takedowns are even more stellar.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ You can press G when you're lost to have objective markers appear on your screen.\n+ Like the first game, collectibles outside upgrades are all optional. Enigma codes offer Ubercommander missions, which are optional assassination missions, and there's an infinite supply of them. Others add lore or art.\n+ You can now stealth kill armored Nazis and tamper with robot Nazis!\n+ While you don't auto pick up health or ammo, you now auto pick up armor at least.\n+ Native 21:9 support including HUD and both pre-rendered and ingame cutscenes (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9RQlCbrPi0).\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Hubs. Hubs in video games are often unnecessary, particularly one of this size.\n+ Sprint is no longer toggle by default in this game. This is super weird because it's hard otherwise to dash because you need to use two fingers, so I set it to toggle. You can press X to dual wield again as in The New Order but which was turned off in The Old Blood. Crouch is also back to Ctrl but still toggle. Also, LMB now shoots right gun in dual wield.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://wolfenstein.fandom.com/wiki/Upgrade_Kits, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USAcIfPpNXc\n+ on difficulty in wolfenstein 2 | https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/7dqsqr/can_we_talk_about_how_ludicrous_the_difficulty_in/dpzxe5u/\n\nI chose to sacrifice Fergus this time as apparently Wyatt's sideplot adds more to the story (https://www.reddit.com/r/Wolfenstein/comments/8drhb9/whats_the_difference_between_the_wyatt_and_fergus/). Plus, he gives a different weapon than the Laserkraftwerk, so more variety! Like The New Order and The Old Blood I played at normal (Bring 'em on!) difficulty. I only used a guide to get all weapon upgrade kits in a level and otherwise played blind for immersion. I chose weapon upgrades according to guns I just used more often. For contraptions, I started with Constrictor Harness mostly for Silent Step as the major benefits from the other two are health/armor regeneration for Ram Shackles and lack of overcharged health depletion for Battle Walker (https://wolfenstein.fandom.com/wiki/Contraptions). Missing first Weapon Upgrade kit in Manhattan Nuclear Bunker and Weapon Upgrade Kit for Rosewell Downtown; I'm missing a total of 3 for max upgrades. I only completed side missions in Eva's Hammer to unlock contraption upgrades and did I complete all ubercommander missions.",

Due to its only 6 hour playtime, there aren't any upgrade collectibles and just a simplified perk system which is fine by me. Instead, there's three health upgrade perks, and there are just a tad new mechanics: climbing a wall with two pipes; and destroying unstable walls with pipes. This adds a bit more verticality to level designs and interweaving of areas which I like. Weapons are mostly the same but with some variations (I love the emphasis on melee and the new sawed-off shotgun in the zombie chapters).\n\nDetails:\n\n+ Cutscenes are stretched in 21:9 but otherwise no major issues (still mostly 16:9 like the HUD though).\n+ Crouch changed the default keybinding from Ctrl in The New Order to C in this game. Why?\n+ First mission is okay as mandatory stealth with a limited arsenal, but it's inconsistent with the rest of the game's shooter with stealth as optional. It plays like Outlast being stuck in prison dodging monstrosities, or Half-life with your crowbar.\n+ Instead of just telling distance to commanders, you're also shown the direction they're in.\n+ Fire troopers are significantly more balanced in this game. They're weak to their fire tank and die instantly once it explodes. Super soldiers are ridiculous bullet sponges still however, but I do like the mechanic where if you hit them enough times, they stagger in which you can melee them and break the armor to reveal a sensitive area which makes them super easy to kill in the second phase.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ all 3 health upgrades guide | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo-wGS_8_cw\n+ Performance fixes for 60 FPS gameplay | https://steamcommunity.com/app/350080/discussions/0/620712364045379458/",

    "comments": "Wolfenstein is a mix of run and gun, stealth, and cover shooter. It's not quite the run and gun of old school FPS games or Doom (2016). Rather, it's a mix of gameplay elements that works quite well given its core FPS mechanics. At reasonable didficulty levels, all are viable and allow you to transition from one to the next (e.g., stealth to guns blazing when alerted) even if the stealth mechanics aren't very nuanced. The story is quite polished and fits well into a linear narrative.\n\nThe major flaws are the enemy variety, difficulty spikes, poor hit indication, and overly responsive enemies. Enemy AI in general is not great. While a great game, The New Order is overrated in the fanbase, with the largest praise being the story and characters which distinguish the game from yet another FPS that's all action with a paper thin story. But the story is riddled with plots and the characters do not develop. Levels like swimming are unreplayable and kill pacing. For comparison, a better cinematic experience integrating storytelling, action, and stealth is Uncharted 4. The New Order doesn't push enough on its core strengths (silliness and brutality of run and gun killing nazis, more invokved stealth mechanics, more weapons). This is also why I prefer The Old Blood which drops most of the story and lushes on the core action. See the unique elements of Wolfensteinâs gameplay mechanics that I all really enjoyed that FPS genre should all do.\n\n__Story.__ The premise of Nazi Germany winning World War II is a great one. And the story is decently substantiated building on the badassery of Wolfenstein's protagonist unlike any other in the series. The mix of story cutscenes and gameplay is linear like Call of Duty.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Wolfenstein: The New Order uses both a mix of old-school chaotic combat with modern FPS. Modern elements include stealth to keep the gameplay fresh as well as side mechanics such as hotwiring, prison escape, hub fetch quests, vehicles, and space suit; reload and cover mechanics; collectibles; upgrades; and partial regenerative health. Classic elements include the trio of health, armor, and ammo, secret passages and nazi gold, enemies.\n\nThere are some notable mechanics. Health overcharge lets you pick up all the health packs, and it will slowly dwindle down to your max HP (I really like this idea). You can slide by moving from Sprinting to Crouching which is very nice. Dual wield. Cover fire mode. Lean mechanic. Stealth take downs.\n\nThe stealth mechanics are rudimentary, making it difficult to really proceed without trial and error. For example, there are no field of vision/early warning of alert status; lighting; or diverse stealth arsenal. This can also ruin some fun as the game spawns an infinite number of enemies, so you can only proceed successfully if you know the officer locations to stop alarms. And there's no way to turn off the alarm like a radio switch.\n\nThe progression system for Perks is an interesting one: based on completing challenges rather than collecting items or leveling up.\n\nThere are serveral collectibles that incentivize exploration: enigma codes offer several game modes; gold, letters, concept art, and character bios add to the lore; and weapon and health/armor upgrades (health/armor depending on Wyatt or Fergus route). The latter are the only ones affecting gameplay and appear roughly only once a level.\n\nThe enemy designs are decent but don't stand out in having distinctive enough mechanics that make each one iconic in their own way. Contrast with, e.g., Doom's weapons and enemies, each of which have a distinct moveset that encourages mastering and adapting to a certain mechanic---whether it be range from melee to medium range; to mobility of enemies from fast-moving to slow. Weapon choices are distinct and enjoyable however: knife, grenade, silenced pistol for stealth, assault rifle with dual wield for short to mid range, marksman for mid to long range, laserkraftwerk for armored enemies, and shotgunf or short range.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Graphics look like a AA game for 2014; it's not awfully bad but not great. There are abrupt transitions between cutscenes and gameplay, sometimes dynamic soundtrack changes during fights as well. This makes for a disjointed experience. The prerendered cutscenes show their age with limited 30 FPS, poor widescreen scaling, and stuttering. I do enjoy the variety in settings from prisons to facilities to sewers.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Constantly retrying levels at Uber difficulty, not really learning mechanics but learning the right positioning to take down X enemy first.\n+ The annoyance of firing hundreds of bullets at the bullet sponges that are Fire Troopers and Super Soldats. Fuck these enemies.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Mission objectives on where to go next are displayed on the map and not via a HUD. Similarly, the automap points out collectibles and commanders instead of having a radar HUD. Fewer things on the screen!\n+ Nightmare levels integrating Wolfenstein 3D into the game. They're the predecessor to Doom (2016) going even further in enabling a piece of the classic levels into the game's levels themselves.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ You have to explicit press E to pick up ammo rather than just run over it. Makes it player closer to an RPG like Elder Scrolls in that aspect.\n+ Apparently poor 21:9 support as it's Hor+ and distorted (https://www.wsgf.org/dr/wolfenstein-new-order/en). HUD is fixed at 16:9 and miscellaneous are stretched. Certain pieces of the HUD that go away in 16:9 remain as artifacts in 21:9. I used Flawless Widescreen, although I don't know if it is actually applied (I don't think it did because I did not leave it running when playing the game).\n+ Startup screen is annoying although not as bad as Doom (2016)'s. I set an option to skip it (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=261768809).\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ http://www.gamersheroes.com/game-guides/wolfenstein-new-order-guide-weapon-upgrade-location-guide, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc0va8tadRw\n+ http://www.gamersheroes.com/game-guides/wolfenstein-new-order-guide-health-upgrade-locations/\n\nYou can pick up plating from dead enemies in order to restore armor. This is a great mechanic that acts like a predecessor to Glory Kills.\n\nGenerally recommended as the first to start with in the series. Motivated to play after DOOM (2016). I first tried on the hardest difficulty (Uber), but gave up as it encouraged cover shooter and a very cautious playstyle which I didn't really like. I took the Fergus route to get health instead of armor upgrades. The super soldat and Fire Trooper enemies are way too fucking spony in Uber. They take hundreds of bullets, and Run and Gun is not viable. After finally dealing with the bullshit of the Submarine level in Mission 13, I went to normal difficulty (Bring 'em on!) as I feel the game is just better balanced and designed that way: you're otherwise forced to go incredibly cautious, turtling and/or relying on stealth. Run and gun is not viable, and I don't feel I really improve over multiple trials but memorize from trial and error the proper positioning within an arena to take down enemies.

    "comments": "Doom (2016) is a masterpiece of metal and rage. It is the best FPS I've played to date (May 2020). It overhauls elements of the shooter genre, steering a direction away from modern FPS's cover shooter in appeal to the 90s style. Doom establishes a unique stronghold with aggressive mobility, old school elements such as the lack of sprint or reloading, and old school level designs that just drop you in a zone to navigate while occasionally locked into mini-deathmatch arenas. Doom renovated the classic style by maintaining a frenetic pace with the Glory Kill system to recover health, Chainsaw to recover ammo, and excellent enemy designs encouraging a mix of short to mid range tactics. For better or worse, it deliberately removes the more puzzle and sandbox levels in favor of a linear design. It has outstanding visuals and a metal soundtrack.\n\nFlaw-wise, the arenas of enemy waves feel lazy as they kill the free-roaming flow (contrast the first few missions vs the latter half of the games' waves). Evironmental and level design can be lacking, feeling same-y as you progress through levels. Bosses could be improved and only appeared near the end.\n\n__Story.__ Some frills. Demons unleashed from hell. Sufficient.\n\n__Gameplay.__ I love Doom's mix of melee/mobility and gunplay. Doom encourages aggressivity and mobility by providing health packs and ammo across the area; powerups; melee being a powerful attack; enemy hitscan has bullet traversal, so you can dodge attacks in the open as opposed to sitting behind cover; double jump; and mini-deathmatch like arenas. Details like highlighting of when an enemy is stunned and ready for a glory kill is seamless. Particularly noticeable is its lack of scope, reload, cover-shooting, sprinting prevalent in modern FPS. Overall, I loved its strategic elements on top of its frenetic pacing: ammo/weapon management, rushing glory kill for health, rushing chainsaw for ammo, when to call it quits with BFG and grenades/AOE.\n\nThe glory kill mechanic is perhaps the single greatest invention in FPS. It pushes on the core essence of what makes Doom so interesting: aggresion. This is push-forward combat, going beyond the circle strafing in classic Doom's open areas or the corner peeking and retreating in classic Doom's closed corridors. The idea of health replenishment also bypasses two patterns in classic Doom: the sandbox level navigation in mazes with potential traps; and the hunt for health, armor, and ammo pickups by going back to previous corridors. Doom Eternal further advances this with the chainsaw (as a cooldown instead of explicit ammo), Flame Belch, and limited ammo per weapon to maximize full usage, but it all started with the glory kill.\n\nDoom reeks of old school design, which I love: no sprint; powerups; multi-level level designs. The upgrades feel the most AAA in terms of tropes.\n\nWeapons are all excellent and I found use cases for most all of them..\n\nSecrets reward exploration via gameplay incentives. For example, Doomguy collectibles and classic maps unlock weapon upgrade points. Field Drones provide weapon upgrade shops. Elite Guard corpses provide Prator tokens for suit upgrades. Rune Challenges provide rune upgrades. Argent Cells provide upgrades. Automaps mark all collectibles on the map. Miscellaneous collectibles unlock lore/art.\n\nThere's a good set of enemy variety, and introduced across the missions so they stay fresh. Bosses were rather lackluster and only appeared from Lazarus Lab (mission 9) and beyond.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Metal. And bloody animations, multiple per enemy. I love it. The detailed resolution is astounding: I could see this game being released in 2020 with its quality.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ The opening scene where an overlay provides exposition and Doomslayer just smashes the HUD.\n+ The adrenaline of opening up a gore nest and slaughtering the enemies.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ I love the classic maps. Perfectly integrated into the game. Fun throwback.\n+ Cutscenes all rendered ingame.\n+ They explicitly tell you how many of each collectible per level.\n+ Checkpoint system works well with a lack of explicit saving.\n+ I love the miscellaneous improvements Doom (2016) had over the original 1993 version: for example, Berserk powerup, where the original had poor hit detection to easily run up and whack-a-mole an enemy; easier finding of health and ammo via Glory Kills and Chainsaws; just enough handholding if you're lost in mission objectives.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ You can't skip cutscenes. Minor annoyance if you want to replay the game just for the gameplay.\n+ If you restart a mission, you lose all progress, including collectibles, challenges, and Rune and weapon challenges. I had to replay Mission 8 because the game cut me off from backtracking to get a collectible I missed. Surprisingly, I wasn't as annoyed by this as I thought I would since the game is so damn enjoyable.\n+ Missions 8 and 9 are not backtrackable, meaning you have to replay the mission if you missed collectibles.\n+ Rune trials are very linear and not very challenging, just trial and error.\n+ The map is a weird 3D mess that seems unnecessarily complicated.\n+ While I love the weapon variety, fully utilizing all 8 can be a nightmare until you master recalling all 8 keybinds to muscle memory. PC weapon swap keybinds are especially awkward for 6 (Super Shotgun), 7 (Gauss Cannon), 8 (Chaingun). I remapped them to Q, Z, and X respectively.\n+ I semiregularly ran into two bugs: clipping through the floor and falling to my death; an enemy being stuck and being forced to reload a checkpoint to continue with the mission.\n+ Startup takes way too long. Fortunately there's an advanced option to set to skip it.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ secrets guide (doesn't cover field drones, new weapons, and miscellaneous secrets like megahealth) | https://guides.gamepressure.com/doom/guide.asp?ID=35390\n+ weapon guide | https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/7bwjo4/the_fundamentals_of_doom_2016_my_tips_on_how_to\n+ upgrade path | https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/77otin/upgrade_path_for_ultranightmare/, https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/51jw11/tips_for_what_to_upgradeprioritize_on_nightmare/\n+ argent dawn upgrades. do whatever you've been struggling with | https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/83jg3a/how_do_you_guys_level_up_the_argent_cells_do_you/\n+ doom monsters comparison | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcF2KI7y3CY\n+ quick switch technique (SSG<->SSG; GC<->RL) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_S7cm8JycN4\n+ clockner's runs | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72S2aAxtZOs\n\nAs I got used to difficulty (and thoroughly enjoyed learning mechanics) since delving into Souls-like games, I tried the highest available difficulty: Nightmare. Ultra Nightmare is not available, and you also end the campaign from one death(!). In mission 2 I kept dying repeatedly, with damage being unrelenting, ammo scarce, and getting only little health replenished from Glory Kills. I went with Ultra-Violent and found the game well-balanced and smoother, bordering on easy. I went with weapon and suit upgrades somewhat ad hoc as there's not really so much \"builds\" in this game. I only did research on Argent Cells and weapon mods. I used a guide to find all secrets but to avoid pacing issues I only did this near the end of each level or when there's a noticeable break in terms of exploration. My favorite Runes are Armored Offensive, Ammo Boost, and Intimacy is Best, but I used all runes to level them up as I played.\n\nMy favorite guns in my standard rotation are: Combat Shotgun's explosive for small to mid enemies followed by Super Shotgun for short range; Heavy Assault Rifle for mid to long range; Rocket Launcher and Gauss Cannon for single-target big enemies. I use the Chainsaw, grenade, and BFG when I'm overwhelmed. I never use the Pistol, Plasma Gun, or Chaingun. The pistol is infinite ammo and generally bad. The Plasma Gun has lower per-shot damage than the Heavy Assault Rifle and shares ammo with the Gauss Cannon (Heavy Assault Rifle shares ammo with the Chaingun but that's not as useful). The Chaingun isn't useful because Doom (2016) has enemies all around you as opposed to previous games (https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/96zhrk/the_case_for_omitting_the_chaingun/).",

    "comments": "New to the series are the Super Shotgun and a few enemies such as Archvile, Mancubus, and Revenants. The Super Shotgun adds significant DPS as the Combat Shotgun was the primary staple for most DPS due to abundance of ammo in the original game. This makes the fights a lot more hectic this cycle. These enemies added more variety to fights as they went a bit beyond the single projectile attack and melee that the first Doom had.\n\nFlaw-wise, Doom II is effectively a new set of levels, and they're a mixed bag often with questionable quality. Many are gimmicky---feeling like a chore to tough the level out rather than enjoyable to explore. Further, while new enemies like Archvile are well-designed, Pain Elementals' infinite respawning of one of the most annoying enemies, and Chaingunners, are not good.\n\n__Specific memories:__\n\n+ Fuck Pain elementals.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ M5's use of lighting.

As of writing this in May 2020, I chose not to play the Master Levels as they're a monetized collection of 3rd party maps that aren't even the best 3rd party maps in 2020; Final Doom because it's apparently unbalanced and difficult; and Doom 64 and Doom 3 do preserve the frenetic madness as the original games.\n\nAt map 11, I switched from Chocolate Doom to Crispy Doom to benefit from a 640x400 over the original 320x200 resolution, 21:9 rendering, uncapped framerates, and extended automap colors which is a huge quality of life improvement in knowing what unlocked once you find a key. Around map 22, I start feeling the tedium of the maps. So I turned on cheat codes and zoomed by them.",

Episode 4 was released two years after Doom (1993), and one year after Doom II, and it's clear from the progression that it's standalone and was designed in parallel by many folks. There's inconsistent difficulty in enemy balance. Level progression includes arbitrary difficulty spikes with too many spongey enemies, too little ammo, and bullshit traps such as enemies shooting from one-sided walls. It requires precise BFG and invulnerability suit usage (especially E4M1 and E4M2). I would be all for difficulty if it involved new enemy mechanics to master, not arbitrarily remembering how best to use limited ammo and secrets.\n\n In the first three episodes, there's a masterful sense of progression from scientific facilities (Episode 1) to a mix of facilities and hell (Episode 2) to hell (Episode 3), and with weapons, enemies, and overall difficulty. Episode 4 has none of that.\n\nI played all of Doom (1993) by saving only at the start of the episode. I abandoned that rule for Episode 4.",

    "comments": "Doom has possibly the largest legacy than any other video game. Evaluated as a video game itself, I found it quite enjoyable, immensely so for Episode 1. The combat with weapons, enemies, level designs, and HUD system all worked well. The aesthetic and sound age well even to 2020. Development-wise, Doom's source code and engine paved the way for many popular titles as well as the modding community.\n\n__Story.__ A man fighting hell. That's all that's necessary for this game.\n\n__Gameplay.__ I love the move and shoot gameplay. Playing it in 2020, I'm surprised at how well the game aged in 27 years. It's amazing fighting a dozen+ enemies all at the same time as you weave around the map. Weapons are a core set and all excellent at serving a purpose. The shotgun is iconic. I would also add to that the melee with fists and chainsaw followed by the Pistol, Chaingun, Plasma gun, Rocket Launcher, BFG. Positioning is key to avoid getting trapped and overwhelmed by enemies.\n\nEnemies are well-designed and memorable, each serving a purpose. The basic marines, imps, etc. Pinkies. Specters. The spongy bastard Baron of Hell and Cacodemons. Level designs drop you in an area to explore, with a handful of blocked areas according to keys. Health and ammo packs scattered throughout an area. Missions are only a few minutes long, making the game an easy \"pick up and play\".\n\nAmbushes and traps are so many and so fun: as opposed to enemy spawns in modern games, these enemies are hidden behind walls requiring intricate level design (the false exit in Halls of the Damned!). It's the Dark Souls equivalent of mobs hiding behind a corner. \n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Love the rock soundtrack. It's not as great as folks make it out to be as it's arguably even plagiarism of popular rock songs. But it's iconic. The pixel art and spirte assets age very well playing it in 2020. I love the use of lighting where some areas black out and you have to fight your way through an ambush. And the varied assets. this clearly distinguishes Knee-Deep in the Dead from the other Episodes. And I love that the levels go from scifi in episode 1 to a descent in madness in the third episode. The triplet of health, armor, and ammo is golden.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Oh wow, the relations to Chex Quest are so clear (the first Doom-like I played).\n+ Fending off Barons of Hell in E4M2. Perfect Hatred is such an apt title.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Secrets. They're like collectibles, but optional so there's no gameplay incentive forcing you to find them all like in modern games.\n+ Monster infighting. Wow that friendly fire.\n+ Projectiles are dodgeable, not instant travel (hit scan). Doom (1993) may have either invented this or at the least popularized it.\n+ Cheat codes.\n+ Interactable explosive barrels. Barrel level placement is one of the reasons Episode 1 reigns supreme.\n+ Pre-attack frames. This is crucial for corner peeking hitscan enemies in particular, and not all Doom clones following it had this, like Shadow Warrior where you effectively just trade hits.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ There is no aiming up and down so the game would autoaim vertically for you as the game used 2D coordinates. Crosshairs haven't been invented yet either.\n+ All the corpses and bloodshed stay there and don't despawn.\n+ The quicksaving / save scumming system rather than checkpoints.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Run is an option. Nowadays, source ports have an Always Run option for quality of life.\n+ It's not always clear when a zone newly opens up in the level after you complete a certain objective. This requires a bit of wandering around in the game to see if anything changed. The map could be improved with highlighting locked doors.\n+ Many missions in Doom (episodes 2+, e.g., E2M2, E2M3, E3M6, E4M2) are very scarce on ammo, making annoying to run past enemies to find loot. This is my gripe with quite a few missions. It's not quite the run and gun shooter that one would hope for as it's not feasible to kill all enemies given limited ammo.\n+ Powerups like Berserk actually last the entire level and not just during the visual effect.\n+ You lose everything when you die. This means it's better to save the game at the start of a mission and loading it upon death rather than relying on the game's reload.\n+ The jumping in E4M2 is god awful.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Doom/Walkthrough\n+ doom wads | https://zdoom.org/wiki/IWAD\n+ [Doom maps, including keys](http://www.classicdoom.com/maps)\n+ linking chocolate doom to ultimate doom | https://steamcommunity.com/app/2280/discussions/0/143387886720274443/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/etk1kg/is_there_any_difference_between_doom_games_on\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/doom/PC_Cheats\n\nI played Chocolate Doom as it's recommended as the most \"vanilla\" experience. GZDoom are best for modern features (e.g., non-pillarboxed widescreen resolution, freelook, crosshair, 60 FPS) and modding. I plan to start with Chocolate Doom first, and then see if I want the higher resolution pixel art of 3440x1440 and 60 FPS instead of the original release's 35 FPS. I played on Ultra-Violence as itâs the highest without being unfair. Nightmare has enemy respawns every 12 seconds, which disfavors exploration/full clears. I like that Chocolate Doom is borderless! I did do keyboard remapping for WASD/E (https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Setup/Keyboard_configuration), disabled vertical mouse movement, and set to always run. I did not play with a guide for secrets, playing it blind and only referring to one if I got stuck.",

Parry is especially an important skill to master at higher difficulties: it's an expert skill as it requires timing each enemy's mechanics and exploiting its animation-cancelling ability.\n\nI love its mix of persistence and roguelike elements, persistence coming through both the Collector's upgrades as well as the increased difficulty, enemy variety, and gear once you \"beat\" the game. The levels have a diverse set of enemies and level design. The rally mechanic similar to Bloodborne is a great way to keep up with an aggressive pacing.\n\nMy one main issue with the game's progression is the discontinuity in weapon upgrades. It's too reliant on finding the right weapon with the right affix, and you having to spend tons of gold until you get there. In contrast, in Risk of Rain 2 for example, RNG is always present but this is adjusted for by the significant amount of items picked up across the run. In addition, the game feels overly grindy in being stingent with Cells (it should at least grow much more as difficulty scales).

I may have gotten lucky as I got my first Boss stem cell after roughly 10 runs. I first started with melee brutality, playing it like Dark Souls. It turns out that the mechanics encourage ranged however as the damage is only a tad less than melee but much safer. And survival can offer just as much DPS while being also significantly more tanky with parries, HP pool, and damage reduction passives. Boy did I feel its unforgiving nature once 1BC started, with a limited health replenishment pool across biomes, significantly more enemy damage, enemies much tankier and would not die in seconds (leaving them room to respond). My preferred route is in terms of scrolls and not always timed doors: Promenade of the Condemned (option of 3 minute timer) -> Ramparts (option of 8 minute timer) -> Black Bridge -> Stilt Village (option of 15 minute timer) -> Clock Tower -> Clock Room.\n\nAfter 29 playtime hours, I reached a roadblock on 2 BSC and felt the game didn't offer enough new content that's worth playing.",

To get myself reacquainted with the game after not playing since March 2019, I completed all remaining sub-missions except two boss missions, and delved into Way of the Strong (New Game+)'s mission levels to balance with the DLC's.\n\nI found myself doing much lower damage than I expected to kill mobs. So I familiarized myself with stat builds, skill tree, guardian spirits, clans, titles, gear, and crafting. I respecced to go full Katana, which still leaves me room for also using Dual Katana.

    "comments": "Final Fantasy 12 excels in its worldbuilding, real-time battle system with Gambits, License Board customization, semi-open world design, and soundtrack. However, its story or characters don't stand out, and the largely autopilot combat can feel less engaging than the most fun part of the game which is building the characters. Like many Final Fantasy games, it tends to overstay its welcome particularly an overly bombastic, hugely scaled climax.\n\n__Story.__ Not a cosmic conflict of unviersal proportions? Yes please. The story is politically-stylized, playing out like a space opera like Star Wars. World-wise, I love that it builds on the same world as the Final Fantasy Tactics series, from job systems to roles/races like Judges, Viera, and Bangaa. The ensemble cast is decent but do not necessarily stand out in their roles or dynamic with the other characters. This includes the main villain of Vayne and the Empire who are largely forgettable. Vaan feels like (and was actually developed as) the titular Tidus, the young angsty teenager.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Final Fantasy XIII stands out in its active, 3-dimensional combat system. I love the ambition in going further beyond quasi-real-time (ATB) turn-based combat. It encourages a tank/healer/DPS setup with an aggro system. Additionally, the Gambit system allows the player to script condition-specific character actions. Battles are more about the preparation than actually fighting the enemy. I think this mode plays quite well with the game as you sort of go on autopilot for random encounters and instead focus on map navigation. It helped for speeding through the grindy parts of the game as I just navigated through areas on 4x speed: the combination of Gambit system and 4x speed works wonders. The Gambit system is especially good at automating away all the tedious status effect benefits: Decoy, Haste, Regen, Bubble, Protect, Shell; and for enemy status effects, Esuna, Dispel, and others Esuna doesn't heal.\n\nQuickening system as the approach to Limit Breaks / Trance / Overdrive. It uses a combo party system similar to Overdrive, where you need to keep track of each person's Mist Charge so you maximize Mist Charges. I found this approach forgettable.\n\nCharacter customization via the License Board system, with a choice of job to specialize each character (and later, a second job choice). Subject to a choice of class per character, it proceeds like a simplistic form of Final Fantasy X's Sphere Grid. It's one of Final Fantasy 12's strengths.\n\nI have mixed feelings about the Hunts, which provide a fun optional set of sidequest content in the game not unlike Monster Hunters (but much much more distilled). But the chain of events before the individual fights largely feel too formulaic. This includes the optional Espers.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ It's difficult to assess the graphics playing in 2020, and on a 2016 remake. With that said I'm impressed at the 3D models; it's decently playable and not as pixelated as, e.g., Oblivion, but it does suffer from blockiness, smoothing, and lack of detail such as facial expressions. I love that encounters don't spawn an additional loading screen, although the game does have quite a few for loading all the subareas/maps. Level designs feel especially barren. Soundtrack is excellent as usual for the Final Fantasy series.\n\nOther mechanics are standard: Technicks, Magick, bestiary, bosses, Cartographer's Guild. Unfortunately, the Technicks fell by the wayside as the physical characters do most DPS with autoattack.\n\nI miss the lack of a world map and actual piloting. For the first time in the series, it's hard to get a sense of geography.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Dying frustratingly to Trickster as I don't have Bio and can't figure out how to kill him when he goes immune and starts doing powerful AoE with comet.\n+ Zerging Zeromus.\n+ Doing Hunt after Hunt and getting incredibly bored.\n+ Spending most of my time maximizing my License Board considerations.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ The first Final Fantasy to not feature random encounters like Dragon Quest? Fuck yes.\n+ Zodiac Age includes LB button to turn on \"Speed Mode\" for 2x/4x for grinding/movement. Amazing quality of life element, particularly since these games are in the era without a sprint mechanic.\n+ You can sell items in bulk, and with the Y button to go down to 0 or the max; otherwise you have to hold the Up key.\n+ You can pause during cutscenes.\n+ 21:9 and borderless support (although you can't change many settings once you start the game).\n+ Like Dragon Quest, instead of just accumulating Gil, you typically get it by farming loot which you then vendor.\n+ Like most all FF games, party members must be in the active party in order to gain XP. This encourages using all of them as you swap in based on whoever has the lowest level. LP is gained equally which I like.\n+ The enemy chaining system provides a fun incentive for grinding.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Save system is both automated via checkpoints (whenever you enter a zone) and with manual save points.\n+ Multiple map interfaces: Select to take up the full screen; minimap; and L3 to turn on a Diablo-like map that overlays a larger portion of the HUD.\n+ You can't respec for the License Board.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Loot from common treasure chests and their location is random. This discourages exploration. On the other hand, this does mean there are much fewer missables as most items appear from the Bazaar system.\n+ You have to keep track of items you sell because the Bazaar resets on each new item unlock, so you can get locked out of powerful items if you don't sell in the right order.\n+ This game has way too many status effects to manage, especially mid to late game.\n+ Unlike any other positive status effect, decoy is missable.\n+ Giza Plains has a weather cycle that shifts between two maps each with their own gated content for rain and dry seasons.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ walkthrough | https://jegged.com/Games/Final-Fantasy-XII\n+ https://brightrockmedia.com/2020/02/02/ff12-job-combos-and-best-jobs-for-each-character\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyXII/comments/6mdbi2/quick_guide_to_12job_party_optimization\n+ on the outdatedness of shikari/foebreaker | https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyXII/comments/crgkex/shikarifoebreaker\n+ english and japanese voice comparison | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFTl-l3AIbo\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyXII/comments/ayobpp/what_to_get_first_on_a_license_board/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyXII/comments/87qf7s/need_advise_in_quickenings_and_esper_allocation/\n+ should you sell all loot items? everything except teleport stones and great serpentskin | https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXII/comments/6mvman/are_most_of_the_loot_items_salable\n+ grimoire purchasing order (canopic jar included) | https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/191202-final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age/75605961\n+ ally=any and foe=any | https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyXII/comments/6nxjhk/allyany_gambit_is_a_smart_universal_gambit_thatll\n+ retrospective review, including development history | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG9Ta3-Rsfo\n+ skip quickening 2 for shikari | https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyXII/comments/6m5yst/shikari_question/\n\nI played the high-definition remaster (The Zodiac Age) on PC, with a controller, and Japanese voice acting (FF12's English voice acting is argued among the best in the series, particularly suited for its western setting; but I still prefer catering to the creator's original direction and given that the setting is still a Japanese-fantasized western setting rather than a true western one). It seems the definitive port as it supports higher display resolutions 60 FPS, multiple soundtrack versions (e.g., \"Reorchestrated\" is the remake with higher sound quality; and \"OST\" is the official soundtrack with minor variations), and the International Zodiac Job System's expanded features.\n\nI played with Battle Mode as Wait and Battle Speed as its fastest setting. I deliberately tried to play without following along on a walkthrough as I have a tendency in JRPGs to follow line for line, and this ruins enjoyment because it plays like a manual to follow and can also spoil plot. Walkthroughs best serve as builds, tips and tricks, and a missables checklist. I especially tried to lean more towards missing things by not looking at a walkthrough until I really needed than, than leaning towards doing everything (which I fall into in all my JRPG playthroughs). For FF12, I still use it for sidequests and meta-building, but I deliberately avoid following the walkthrough for plot as one journeys through areas, knowing precise item locations, engaging with enemies, bosses, etc. As a hard-restriction I only examine these after I complete the area.\n\nMost builds are viable, particularly now with two jobs. Reading through guides, I chose: Vaan as Bushi/Monk (Masamune I + Genji Gloves user), Penelo as Black Mage/Monk, Balthier as Shikari/Time Battlemage (Yagyu Darkblade user), Fran as White Mage/Machinist, Basch as Knight/Bushi (Excalibur + White Robes user), and Ashe as Red Battlemage/Archer (Burning Bow + Ardor user). I chose Quickenings and Espers somewhat adhoc to get any extra slots. For Hunt Club, I went the route of Genji Gloves/Ribbon instead of Zodiac Spear/Zodiac Esutcheon (the latter has a respawnable 1% chest).\n\nThing I didn't complete as I found them unnecessary filler:\n\n+ Hunts: 31, 32, 40-45\n+ Espers: Chaos, Ultima, Zodiark\n+ Hunt Club\n+ Omega Mark XII\n+ Trial Mode\n+ Ann's Letter (no meaningful rewards)\n+ Fishing (too much effort for Wyrmhero Blade)\n+ Cockatrice Round-up (too much effort for Defender)\n+ other sidequests",

    "comments": "Risk of Rain's core idea is one of tradeoffs: encouraging exploration by having chests/items across the map that you need for upgrades; and not lingering too much per level as difficulty scales over time. It's wonderfully executed, and the balance of item stacking that can go into mid to end game is excellent. You always feel like a god regardless of how the RNG plays out.\n\nFlaw-wise, maps can feel barren and require too much travel, particularly in early stages where it takes 6-7 minutes to go through the full map. (The meta is to rush for the teleporter and clear with around 4 minutes per stage early on.) Deaths are always abrupt and the result of an attack leading to effectively a one-shot (with a flurry of attacks at once removing the one-shot protection).\n\n__Story.__ None, and which is totally fine for a roguelike.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Of the roguelike elements, Risk of Rain excels in its items, enemy variety, bosses, and characters. Each character has unique yet simple mechanics offering a wonderful variety of builds. It balances non-progression of roguelikes via achievements that unlock more items and characters.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Somewhat bland cartoon art. But it ages well.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Dying within seconds of activating the Artifact of Glass. Twice.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://riskofrain2.gamepedia.com/Items\n\nMotivated to play this after watching Sodapoppin stream this many times (first saw him doing it with Pokelawls), and an enthusiastic review from Gmanlives.

    "comments": "Shadow Tactics features excellent core stealth mechanics. The most unique element is the ability to play multiple units at a time, forcing a sort of riddle in its sequence as you get try to past guards. I couldn't get into this as a lot of it ended up being trial and error and riddle-solving.\n\n__Story.__ Story is not bad but also doesn't necessarily stand out. It's enough to keep around the ensemble cast and motivate the Shogun setting and scenarios.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Features some unique stealth elements: having partial visibility in view cones, which is an indicator to stay crouched; multiple players per mission (and Shadow mode to have them operate simultaneously); ranged items that cause sound tell you explicitly who they might inform in their sound radius; verticality in approaches; footprints in snow; lighting and putting out torches which can lure guards. Core stealth mechanics of crouch, quicksaving, caution/alert, areas to hide bodies and yourself.\n\nA core element of the game that grates me is the RTS element, where you must maneuver multiple units at once for stealth. This makes many areas feel closer to a puzzle, which I'm not a fan of. I much prefer stealth games where you control only one unit, so there are no strategy elements.\n\nThis is a challenging game. I was forced to save scum often as it would take so long to try to manuever an area with multiple enemies. It takes 1-2 hours per level.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Graphics are quiet detailed for a game that's not exactly AAA. The signature killcam shots are especially great.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ The frustration of trial and error when encountering a difficult group of guards.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ The quicksave system has a buffer window of 3. This helps avoid the occasional issue where you quicksave in a bad state and must either take the sacrifice or reload the full mission.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Not too much support in terms of a fully non lethal playthrough.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI played on Normal difficulty and Japanese audio. THis genre is pretty interesting; if I want more, I'd go into what influenced this game: the Commandos series. I ultimately stopped playing at the game during Mission 9: Kage-sama's Camp. I couldn't get into each enemy sequence not necessarily involving stealth gameplay but riddle solving in finding the right sequence of enemies to kill and the right use of each unit.",

    "comments": "Until Dawn has a trite but well-paced and polished story with gripping horror elements and dialogue-based and QTE gameplay.\n\n__Story.__ It plays like any other 80s teen B-rated slasher camp, and one that doesn't take itself that seriously.  All the tropes throughout the story are almost hamfisted, but it still works because of camp. And surprisingly they actually all explain it instead of having it as plot holes. Iâm impressed not by the story that goes bananas, but the storyâs pacing. It slowly leaves out clues, letting you try to figure out whatâs going on with the mystery man; the banshee; the ghost helping them from the Seance and the dollhouse and poltergeist activities; the paint and fake newspapers; the flamethrower guy in Chapter 7. Indian rituals and miner backstory. The weirdly specific early death with Josh, one of the key protagonists and acted by one of the most mainstream stars in the cast Rami Malek. Iâm in chapter 5. Mystery man has got to be Josh!\n\nThe illusion of choice. Always a fun storytelling technique. Thatâs how I feel with traits/relationship status numbers. And the death sequences, as if thereâs a major impact on the story. Any character who could've died from a previous segment has a largely irrelevant role for the rest of the story.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Character traits and relationship status HUD is fun. I like the various interactive controls. For example, swiping on the controllerâs sensor bar; or not moving the controller to stay still. The butterfly effect icon (reminds me of Telltaleâs signature âYour action has made a deep impact on Xâs thoughts.â The Donât Move sequence in the finale is so epic.\n\nThe style with the Architect building on your fears. The unknown of how it affects the story.\n\nThe totem mechanic. I love the foreshadowing! This definitely keeps me on edge when playing different characters.\n\nI think quick time events are fine. Itâs a bit dubious however when theyâre mixed with this type of gameplay where you canât replay any actions if you make a mistake. This can add to tension, but oftentimes it just adds to annoyance because itâs a button you have to press: thereâs no skill involved and it can happen at any moment.\n\nThere's quite a few jump scares that I'm okay with given its camp.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ I like the cinematic style, with options like Telltale. Fixed camera angles Resident Evil style. The motion capture was good overall save for the occasional dead eyes in the CGI.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ The bonus content that goes into the making of the game. Reminds me of Blu-Ray/DVD extras for movies. I liked their \"science of fear\" approach to collect biometric data to determine what scares. I can imagine this being particularly helpful after you've seen a scary scene a million times and are no longer sure what the response would be like.\n+ Sometimes the best choice is to not make a choice. This adds ambiguity, where sometimes you don't want to \"win\" the QTE.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://until-dawn.fandom.com/wiki\n\nI only looked at walkthroughs after completing the game. I went through the Until Dawn wiki to get a better sense of the depth and branching paths of differing choices; and what the mechanics actually mean. In my playthrough, Matt was the only one to have died. I also got 80-90% of all clues/totems. I cheated a few sequences to make sure people survived, e.g., the last sequence with Sam. I completed the game in one sitting.",

    "comments": "Alien Isolation excels at a gripping atmosphere as you try to hide from the excellent Alien AI, always looming. Unfortunately, it outstays its welcome, with an overextended pacing and reuse of levels without any progress in characters or gameplay.\n\n__Story.__ The game has horrible pacing. Levels often do not progress any story but are simply filler with keycards, generators, and doors. I like the ending! Death is great.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The minimal HUD and basic controls help with immersion. Alien Isolation uses terminals as their version of notes in horror games for worldbuilding. The objective lists feels a little too video game-y to me.\n\nI love the level designs. It looks models like an actual airport-like location, which causes multiple forking paths in exploration. I'm ambivalent about all the backtracking with newly opened areas as you accumulate tools: it's just extra supplies and some collectibles that don't seem very useful.\n\nI really like the save system. It's manual. It has a distinctive ringing sound of assurance to know when you're near one. And it has a 1 minute or so lockout to make each save feel significant.\n\nLighting doesn't really play a role in gameplay, and I wish that affected stealth.\n\nI found all the many items somewhat tedious to manage. The credit and crafting lite system was a little too AAA and unnecessary. Many of the items like flares, smoke bombs, and noisemaker all felt unnecessary. Too many served a similar purpose.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The graphics are astounding for 2014. I was shocked to hear that. It's clearly up there at 2017 like Horizon Zero Dawn and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, and the ship aesthetics even remind me of Star Wars Fallen Order. You can see age with the face models though.\n\nThe sound design with the soundtrack and the looming Alien keeps you on your toes.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Boy is this game challenging. I first saw this by repeating the medical facility part with the Alien and the humans at least a dozen times.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ There is backtracking so you can collect things you missed.\n+ The delay in waiting for the animation to save game, open locked doors, reading terminals. You can die during all these animations.\n+ The keybind combinations you need to do to unlock doors, activate switches, etc.\n+ Motion tracker and minimap points to where the main mission is, so you can do any sidetracking.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Hilariously, you can bypass the need for flares or flashlight batteries for light by equipping Molotov cocktails.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Subtitle rendering is awful. It's so ugly and intrusive that I turned it off even though I would prefer reading subtitles, particularly for horror as the audio can be very quiet, you're moving around so sound fades, or there are certain details to pick up on.\n+ Map UI. I hate maps. It isn't needed for action-adventure and horror games, which tend to be fairly linear. Maps just complicate things. I did find it helpful in this game for keeping track of the many locked doors and what I now had access to however.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ http://www.gamersheroes.com/game-guides/alien-isolation-guide-blueprint-location-guide/\n\nI played on Hard difficulty as recommended within the game and on Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/alienisolation/comments/4q6an6/which_difficulty_for_a_beginner/). I played with mouse and keyboard. I played with pretty much max items as I did not really use them aside from the flamethrower and medkit.",

It doesn't need too much compleixty like stealth, inventory management with limited resources, or puzzles. The aesthetic and the soundtrack keep the game unsettling.\n\nTons of reused assets.

It's just the sudden audio change that makes you jump, nothing disturbing or horrifying itself.\n\nI like the guy's panting with his limited sprinting.\n\nVarious horror tropes as the scares. I preferr horror that has a unifying theme. It's what originated a lot of these tropes and what makes them disturbing to begin with, not merely that they exist. You should be appealing to the core of what makes a certain type of element horrifying (e.g., covered-hair women Ring style, zombies, other worldly beasts, mutilation porn).

I enjoyed it but was never terrified as I was like the sound design, lighting, and general atmosphere of Amnesia's. Way too linear and gameplay was mostly stealth followed by chase sequences.\n\n__Story.__ Trite, but it had a fine enough pacing to entice you to keep playing.\n\n__Gameplay.__ I like the idea of a camcorder for dark locations, which adds to the sense of anxiety because of your limited and distorted vision. But it can ruin lighting. Sometimes this game plays more like a stealth horror game than a horror walking simulator game. Which can be fine if the stealth elements with the enemy AI weren't janky. The stealth plays like a cat and mouse where you can take two hits so there's still room to run if you're cornered as in Dead by Daylight (combined with health regeneration). And if you run enough there's certain areas that you're always invincible from the enemies. The chase sequences became enough that it played more like an action than horror.\n\nI'm kind of disappointed at the lack of sanity mechanic like in Amnesia. It feels a little artificial otherwise as when I play the game through any potentially scary parts, I sort of dissociate myself from immersion and just play mechanically. And the lack of textures and campiness of the enemy AI makes it not as scary.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Sound design is average; definitely disappointing after coming off of playing Amnesia. Horror elements tend to be very tropey: disfigured humans; shutting doors; jumpscares; blood writing on walls.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ You can look behind you while running.\n+ The amount of batteries felt limited but never so limited that it was frustrating. Throughout the game, I hovered between 5-7, reaching a minimum at worst case of 4.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ You're incentivized to always keep the camcorder on. It doesn't drain battery, the switch to nightvision is faster than turning on the camcorder and switching, and it records new events in your notes.\n+ So many closed doors. They're more an aesthetic choice as they're almost always locked and not worth spending the animation to see if it opens. It took me a while to realize that those which are open-able have the Interact ability.\n+ Quite a few jumpscares. Annoying.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI played on normal difficulty.",

The mechanics of stealth and core movement are minimal and great. Sanity is a great mechanic, and the lack of fighting back. What makes you scared are not the few jumpscares but rather the anxious immersion that truly makes you scared once something does happen. On flaws, the puzzles can be arbitrary at times and wears patience on top of having a limited supply of items. Enemy AI is also janky.\n\n__Story.__ I love the way the few enough notes add to the puzzle-solving and story, alongisde the hallucinations. Only the later encounter with Agrippa felt like a forced exposition dump. I love that only later in the story is it revealed that Alexander can speak to us telepathically, and that the notes slowly reveal his immortality.\n\n__Gameplay.__ I like the sanity mechanic, and the use of lighting. Relying on stealth and the core movement mechanics of crouching, walking, and running, and the lighting is great. The protagonist's constant hallucinations slowing your movement speed and the occasional falling down due to relapses further makes you feel helpless.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Ambient sounds are excellent. The visuals still remain scary today with its lighting and hallucinations. Flashbacks as you enter certain rooms are a great way of both adding to the story and adding to the atmosphere with hallucinations, not knowing what's real. It's all the blurry vision of the unknown that makes you fearful. The Lovecraftian slime that continues to trickle in as you advance is excellent.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Opening the door in the Storage and immediately shutting it once I saw the zombie inside. The UI is rudimentary and basic but serviceable---nothing complicated needed. I like the options for running and stealthing; helps with hiding from monsters and running away.\n+ Shuddering when I opened that when door cabinet, a jumpscare in sound, and a skull and bones fall out.\n+ The chase sequence after the level where you escape the water monster in the sewer.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Autosave. More immersive.\n+ Losing sanity when you see the monster is a great way to skimp on the scariness of the actual monster involved. If you see him in bright light and from Youtube gameplay videos, the monsters are not nerely as scary.\n+ Death penalty is not too harsh: you restart at the last entrance you came into, which means sufficiently ample checkpoints. You do lose out on oil as you continue dying though, so it can be harsh particularly if you get stuck on puzzles.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Oil for the lantern and tinderboxes being limited supply. Makes you be conservative of a finite supply. The finite-ness adds to the anxiety. But I also find it annoying in combination with puzzle-solving, where you can only backtrack a finite number of times as you're literally running out of time.\n+ Enemy AI is too wonky at times. When you die to start a challenging encounter, the enemy can despawn and make going through it again very easy.\n+ All the various common torture traps like the Iron Maiden and the Wheel make it feel a little more trope-y than scary.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.gamesradar.com/cheats/19421\n\nI was very aware of this game Freshman year in college in Fall 2010. I could never play it though as my laptop did not have the specs.\n\nI played with mouse and keyboard. I did not follow a playthrough except when I got stuck in order to keep with immersion rather than completionism. I did lean toward following a guide bit more than I should've in order to streamline the experience, e.g., given multiple routes, I just look up what the right exploration order is, and I don't spend too much time if I'm stuck on a puzzle (I don't like figuring these out). Later on in the game I got more used to the mechanics and assets so I relied less on a guide. Reflecting back, Amnesia is a once in a lifetime opportunity (or at least until you forget the majority of the experience after many years); so it's good to try minimizing the use of walkthrough even if it adds frustration; this is worth it over the risk of spoilers, which I did spoil myself a few times away from some scary sequences since I knew what would happen by accidentally reading the walkthrough's next line.",

Unfortunately, the story nor characters do not develop much so it rests much on its gameplay to keep the game entertaining.\n\n__Story.__ A noncommital and mature protagonist. Three love interests (one just being a side addition) which symbolize comitment/growing up and the other of rebellion. Story lacks changes of setting, staying primarily with his apartment and the bar. The story has too slow pacing and barely develops. You also get little depth into any of the characters.\n\nI hate Rin as a character. She has this fake moe charm that makes the realism feel artificial otherwise. Her cutscenes also don't seem to really fit the rest of the story.\n\n__Gameplay.__ It's surprising how much depth there is to simple block stacking. The added mechanics and introduced techniques as levels progress continue to make the game interesting. I did not expect to get engrossed in this aspect as much as I do; I'm enjoying it like I enjoy Tetris.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Mix of handanimation from Studio 4C and CGI. Not sure how I feel about the transitions. I love the overall art style and wacky game design. It's uniquely Catherine. I don't like the rehashed music though; it quickly becomes repetitive.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI played the Full Body version released in September 3 2019 (NA) on PS4. It is remastered with new content and only available English-localized on PS4. I played with Japanese audio, Normal difficulty, Classic mode, and the default of Maya Sawashiro for Catherine's voice actress.

    "comments": "The game is a fun mix of card mechanics and decently executed story.The repetitiveness and ease of difficulty bored me a bit from the end of chapter 3 and onwards however: no new mechanics. At that point, I found a good enough deck that I never felt incentivized to upgrade or find new cards---instead, it was an obligation.\n\n__Story.__ While the style is great, the story is serviceable with a strong queen and ample \"sidequests\" as you wander around. However, the worldbuilding is little beyond the lore/text descriptions---the exploration on the map itself feels arcade-y---and the characters and side quests do not show the brilliant depth that Witcher 3 does. I do like how moral choices can make various characters come and go along your journey, e.g., Rayla or Isbel, Eyck or the dragon.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Card games with more balance the the original Gwent in Witcher 3. There's also a significant emphasis on puzzle battles. Mechanics have more an emphasis, particularly offense making the card game feel more like an interactive battle than passive power-counting. The game overall balances well deck-building and playing the actual card game.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ I love the story presentation: audiobook-style alongside a classic RPG-style isometric view for wandering and dialogue options. Battles proceed as card games, of which the assets are beautiful.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ In a miscellaneous side quest, assuming you take Rayla along with you, she ends up committing a war crime by slitting the throats fo 40 dwarven prisoners as a racist..\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ There are no manual saves, only autosaves. Interesting choice for a card-game RPG.\n+ Thronebreaker's gold and lumber quickly come in abundance, so you don't have to fret too much about making optimal choices in dialogue or gameplay upgrades.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Game is not that challenging even at the highest difficulty, both in the battles and in moral choices. For the battles, there's little incentive to try new synergy combos with the exception of puzzle fights, which are one-off.  I steamrolled through all of Chapter 2 with Strays Bomber + Strays Slinger, and especially once I got Black Rayla + Xavier Lemmons + Reynard Odo. For the moral choices, losing resources or morale has no long-standing impact.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Performance is quite a slog, which is surprising given that it's just a card game.\n+ Final battle is dreadful. It limits your gameplay options and was the only time I had to change deck strategies. I had to cheese my way with Adept+Forager (https://www.reddit.com/r/gwent/comments/a31q4u/guide_for_final_fight_using_in_thronebreaker_for/).\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/248350-thronebreaker-the-witcher-tales/faqs/76925/walkthrough | Unlike the IGN walkthrough, this provides commentary/tips and more walkthrough detail.\n\nThronebreaker is the single-player mode of the Gwent multiplayer collectible card game which fleshed out as its own game. I like this as I'm not a fan of multiplayer so I have no intention to play any of the Gwent features. What interests me is the story, RPG elements, and the battle via Gwent.\n\nIn general, I made choices appropriate to the Queen's character. But sometimes I did optimize if there were more clearly an optimal choice without consequences. I gathered most but not all treasure chests as I did not need anymore for upgrades by the middle of Chapter 4.",

    "comments": "Witcher 2 is a clear improvement in its refined gameplay and cinematic experience of Witcher 1. But its combat, lack of character and story depth, and rushed ending makes it feel unpolished and not nearly the masterpiece as Witcher 3.\n\n__Story.__ More cinematic and linear than both Witcher 1 and Witcher 3. Still great story all-around, though lacking a bit less in the depth of moral ambiguity and choices as in both games.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Significant refinements since the first game, most noticeably gameplay-wise in the more action RPG-oriented combat system which encourages a hit-and-run style with weak and strong attacks, dodge, and parry/riposte. Consumables like oils and potions, signs like Quen, and crafting after gathering herbs set the stage for Witcher 3's excellent system of preparation/customizability and keeps The Witcher unique as a series. Upgrades are skillpoints for several trees from level ups; item customization; and mutagens on certain talents. The HUD is also much more improved: sleaker overall; dialogue HUD lets you clearly know which option advances the main dialogue and which are optional choices you can use to learn more; more reasonable minimap. Combat overall does not feel as responsive as the original game (e.g., there is no major thunk noise or stagger hitting an enemy; your movement towards an enemy is not as smooth as in Witcher 3).\n\nNo sprinting or jumping though, both crucial movement options (sprinting for moving through areas more quickly without the pacing of backtracking; and jumping for mor erealism where you don't have to run down stairs to fall off or climb impossibly for a miniscule bump).Dice poker is still bad in RNG as in the first game, but fortunately it's limited to one round.\n\nThere are some interesting spins as a Witcher game. You can only drink potions in the meditation state. Potions remain consumable-limited and are not refilled like in Witcher 3. Medallion (which takes several seconds to recharge) acts as your Detective Mode (a somewhat lore-appropriate mechanic). Places/Circles of Power remain closer to Witcher 1 than Witcher 3 as just temporary buffs and not skillpoint increases. Some scenes have a stealth lite mechanic.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ I like the dark, grittier look of the game compared to Witcher 3 which seems more fantastical. The resolution of environment textures remains especially astounding in 2020. Colors are often too saturated in many scenes though, rendering the high resolution rather unnecessary with much of the environment given this weird smoothing effect. Voice acting is actually decent in this game and not a half-hearted attempt in the first game. Love that the character-to-character dialogue isn't just talking heads.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Going through the tedium of Endless Battle and the end of Act II while limited only to the abilities of attakc and block. Dying over and over to the same sequence of mobs.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ I prefer the fistfights' quick time events over typical combat gameplay in Witcher 1 and Witcher 3, which feels stifled.\n+ You have to manually draw your sword most of the time unlike Witcher 1 and 3 (which requires thinking about which sword to use).\n+ Environments feel very large even though the playable regions are much more restricted.\n+ Dark mode dificulty remains punishing all the way through, and in a good way. I could 2-3 shotted and can instantly die if I'm surrounded by enemies which I feel I should be appropriately punished for. I never died enough times that difficult encounters felt frustrating---sometimes only annoying given the combat mechanics have the flaws.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Even more missables than Witcher 3 (which had more than Witcher 1). Not only are chapters sequenced so you miss certain sidequests as you traverse a chapter. But there are many \"secret abilities\" that have somewhat crucial bonuses such as +50 carrying capacity that feel almost mandatory. Quest NPCs can also mysteriously disappear after progressing certain quests. For example, I tried to not craft Chapter I's dark armor until after Asassin of Kings and Where is Triss Merigold? Bad choice. I had to revert to an older save so I could craft them, and then redid the quests.\n+ Riposte has a visual cue. I much prefer the Dark Souls/Witcher 3 approach of timing your block with the enemy's attack in order to start the stagger followed by the optional riposte. I ended up never using parry/riposte in favor of the roll as you also lose Vigor.\n+ Fastest way to move is to take your sword out and double roll around.\n+ Mutagens cannot be replaced, making them effectively never use them until endgame.\n+ Like Witcher 1 (I think), indicators for questgivers do not appear on the map.\n+ Like Witcher 1 and not Witcher 3, the game does not clearly delineate craft items. It does prevent you from selling the most explicit quest items though as you never have to loot gather for Witcher contracts.\n+ Dark mode outfits have a visual and sound cue that becomes grating quickly, especially if you bundle that with the fact that you will almost always have your sword out in order to roll to move faster. It was so intrusive I used a mod to turn it off (https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/649). I also did the same for Dice Poker.\n+ Borderless works natively but is buggy. (\"fullscreen\" option seems to do this by default; doesn't work as well for others though and I do occasionally get black screen which crashes game and/or my whole PC).\n+ No support for 21:9 aspect ratio even though Witcher 1 supports it. I followed this guide (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1529400057).\n+ Saves (including autosaves) accumulate but do not delete themselves. This makes your save list extremely long to the point of crashing the game.\n+ Similar controls as Witcher 3 but with different button layout. What cognitive dissonance.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Witcher_2_quests\n+ https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=269561138\n\nI played with controller. I played on Normal difficulty, the hardest difficulty excluding Insane which insta-deletes your save game if you die once. This is like my experience with Witcher 3 where the early game was the most difficult and it got progressively easier. I turned off \"Difficult QTEs\", which removes it almost entirely. I played on max settings including Ubersampling but kept cinematic DOF off. Apparently, although it looks great, it is a huge performance dip on top of Ubersampling and is overdone in many cutscenes (https://www.resetera.com/threads/digital-foundry-the-witcher-2-in-2020-tech-review-red-engine-analysis-performance-on-modern-pc-hardware.164201/#post-28148409).\n\nChoice-wise I picked Iorveth and saved Triss. Although picking Roche is likely better continuity wise for the Witcher 3, Iorvethâs path is argued to be more realistic for Geralt who plays neutral and would only vy for his friends; and apparently it has better content.\n\n\"I always think Geralt from the book would choose Ioverth because it would be the fastest way to rescue Triss/catch Kingslayer (even though Geralt still got himself into unnecessary involvement) and the fastest way to \"escape\" Roche and all the political mess.\n\nPlus it has more book references, Zarpen Zigrin, more Zoltan, more Dandelion-Zoltain interaction, Philippa Eilhart, LOTR references, sex scenes with the succubus and the elf, better music and better setting.\" https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/4rhyc2/comment/d51frxo.\n\nMy total playtime is X (according to Steam). I played all quests and crafted all Dark mode outfits (including weapons, which made it easier to not think about what to upgrade next to). I only omitted The Secrets of Loc Muinne and The Gargoyle Contract. I did no cheats for Orens, fortunately accumulating enough in Chapter I to craft Blasphemer's and waiting until Chapter III before I could craft Oathslayer's as I was waiting to be able to purchase Studded Leather anyways. At that point I was tired of the game so I just cheated to immediately get the Kinslayer's outfit after having a frustrating experience killing enemies with just Blasphemer's. I played a sword and magic build which seemed most popular. It doesn't seem as optimized in OPness as an alchemy build, but I don't like the idea of relying on consumables which don't have the convenience of replenishing like in Witcher 3.",

    "comments": "It would be generous to say The Witcher hasn't aged well. I would go further to say that the game just isn't good. The story---what is often argued as The Witcher's highlight and certainly the highlight of the series---isn't nearly as compelling as in Witcher 3. There's only a rough draft here of the interactivity with dialogue trees/choices, narrative and character depth, moral quandaries, and political intrigue that the Witcher books and Witcher 3 revel in. The Witcher's poor voice acting and janky graphics diminish its narrative delivery. Combat is also a major flaw. Most of all, I would argue the game's quest design with massive amount of backtracking makes it even more of a slog to play: fetch quests without fast travel, quests being time-based and meditation being restricted to certain locations, NPCs not being at their quest marker depending on time of day, obtrusive quest UI even though you're forced to batch-complete quests at a time.\n\n__Story.__ It's not as great as people make it out to be. Chapter I is a slog. It sets up no interesting depth aside from the known setting building on the books. Chapter II is diluted in pacing with its constant backtracking, and while the idea of narrowing down suspects is interesting, nothing particularly distinguishes it in character development, mystery, or gameplay. Chapter 4 seems completely unnecessary in delving into Alina the noonwraith or the feud between the villagers and the other race. It's an okay story, but it plays out in depth like any side quest in Witcher 3 while detracting from the apcing of the main story. The main villain Aaar Javed and the subvillains like de Wett are not interesting. Salamandra as an evil organization lacks any depth outside of trite arguments like their genocide and crimes not being any different from existing rulers.\n\nThe story is a strange repeat of the books with twists that don't make sense (why not just use the original story?). Triss plays a worse Yennefer, Alvin is a terrible Ciri (he's so whiny with zero character development; perhaps the only redeeming quality is the subtle hint that he's the main villain by the end), and you even have to save the striga again.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Combat is a rhythm game similar to Neverwinter Nights/Dragon Age, stances, and is extremely wonky. So is the camera system, with weird option for over-the-top style that makes mouse navigation intrusive and movement slower unless you're holding W, and a classic RPG/action RPG (e.g., Diablo) isometric style that's less immersive as a point and click but is ultimately more practical. Armor is much more limited with just three available options in the game. Quest choices have downstream consequences, and decisions are based on limited knowledge of the circumstances and a setting of belief and morals. Instead of open world, it's a fixed zone per chapter.\n\nCompared to Witcher 3, what I like most about Witcher 1 are the character interaction options: bribing, drink contests, and giving food to solicit information from random old women NPCs; showing signet rings to display inclusion of certain memberships. Dialogue trees open up new quests and quest advancing.\n\nCombat is not the only janky aspect. Quests have way too much backtracking, where movement across a map has no sprint or fast travel. Certain areas are just awful: the Beast boss fight; Chapter II swamp.\n\nThe Dice Poker game is just bad. Literally 0 skill and all RNG, where difficulty of fighting certain NPCs is gauged by their more favorable RNG (a random roll to an immediate six-high straight; or playing off a pair and getting a full house). There are no interesting mechanics on betting or the hand strategy.\n\nYou can see the rough ideas that become polished in Witcher 3.Highlighting interactable objects is similar to Detective Mode. Combat has finishing moves. Potions, signs, and silver vs steel sword. Journal of characters, bestiary, and quest descriptions, and the descriptions are required to be read for completing Witcher contracts. Meditation with day-night cycles. No inventory load. No jumping or much verticality in environments. Contracts are kill-and-loot mobs similar to WoW, and less like the nice formula Witcher 3 has alongside some good occasional stories.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Hard to evaluate graphics for its time---looks slightly better than Oblivion particularly in facial models. Soundtrack is okay. Voice acting is really off---tone is bad lacking nuance in the delivery. Combine that with the stilted facial animations and the game can feel tone deaf. More reused assets in environments and NPCs than Oblivion in 2006.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Murking around (and dying often) in the swamps for the two longest chapters. What a pain.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Fog of war map.\n+ 21:9 aspect ratio is natively supported. No borderless though (stuck to windowed mode as alt-tabbing breaks with fullscreen) and need a hotfix to render cutscenes without stretching (https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/1462-the-witcher-aspect-ratio-fix-ultrawide-multi-mon).\n+ Most interesting AI being that NPCs hide under cover when it rains.\n+ Some of the specific environment layouts are similar from Witcher 1 to Witcher 3. For example, the spiral ministaircase up to see King Foltest and overall layout in Chapter V's Castle is the same as the Witcher 3's Nilfgaardian castle holding Emhyr.\n+ The wallpapers they show concluding a dialogue decisoin path.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ You can only meditate in certain areas like inns. Similar to Oblivion, you must also meditate to level up.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Missable quests. Tedious amount of bookkeeping in what items to keep as well as tracking quests in batch given the long treks making it impractical to do one quest at a time, and NPCs not necessarily being where the quest marker notes depending on the time of day. Dialogue paths can be entirely missed if you choose the wrong option.\n+ Too many loading screens.\n+ Lack of frequent autosaves (combined with the loading screens) makes restarting after a death a slog.\n+ Can't change difficulty. I wanted so bad to go to Easy and avoid the combat annoyances.\n+ Can't pause during cutscenes.\n+ No fast travel. Sometimes you have to run long distances only to meditate or make short conversations back and forth. There are teleporters, but they're limited.\n+ No recommended level on quests. Hard to sequence which ones to complete given an unstructured list.\n+ Crafting is useless in this game. You can only craft a meteorite sword, and it's quickly replaced with quest rewards.\n+ And I thought Witcher 3's female outfits were revealing. This and the generic big breasted European character models take the cake.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Witcher_quests\n+ https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Witcher_Shopping_List\n\nMy total playtime is 24 hours (according to Steam). I played it on Normal. I don't care much for max difficulty due to the outdated combat mechanics. I only played for the story, historical understanding of gameplay mechanics, and any interesting ideas that were not advanced in Witcher 3. Early game, I prioritized my orens on bestiary and herbarium books (no formula recipes as you can discover via self-experimenting and judicious use of the internet); and I prioritized skillpoints on base attributes. I didn't follow a specific build due to the ample amount of skillpoint, though I did have a tendency to spam Igni given infinite endurance and my impatience with this game. I did not complete all quests (by Chapter 4, I only did main quests).\n\nReaching the swamp in Chapter II, I couldn't stand the game's slow movement speed, back-and-forth pacing, annoying health regen at Normal difficulty. Therefore I added mods: 50% Faster Movement for Geralt; Infinite Health and Endurance; Genie Wish Mod.",

Core gameplay with its combat and progression systems is fantastic. The story is mired in moral dilemma without a clear right-or-wrong, and with decisions having consequences on the world state.\n\nThe combat could be improved as it becomes increasingly repetitive. It lacks character customization/replayability, which is a minor flaw.\n\n__Story.__ Love the story, characters, and the overall presentation. It's clearly a polished story with history behind each dialogue. The main story is excellent. I would watch a television series that's as in-depth like this: for video game standards, it's certainly among the best writing alongside Elder Scrolls and Fallout quests. Geralt of Rivera is a sardonic badass and a father. Ciri acts her age and tomboy upbringing. Dandelion is fantastic; he's more than just your prototypical silly JRPG character, with depth like his crusades across social classes and apparently with a cross-dressing elf Elihal. Even supporting characters like well-written with flaws: the Bloody Baron seems kind at first glance but is a drunken wife-beater; Keira is selfish and willing to share Alexander's medical knowledge to Radovid; the Witches are slowly revealed to require bloody customs from the villages after your decision about the Whispering Hillock. Johnny's enthusiasm and love for alliteration makes me smile. Vesemir, Lambert. The list goes on. Quest choices have consequences on the state of the world, and are often a choice of lesser evils. You can also play as Ciri who has her own moveset (her dash move in particular defines the rhythm). Journal entries are fantastic and unlike most other games, e.g., Tomb Raider or Horizon Zero Dawn, the story's engaging enough that I actually do read them. Even many sidequests are interesting, pushing further on variants such as several Witcher Contracts being not as they seem (e.g., In the Heart of the Woods, Where the Cat and Wolf Play..., Oxenfurt Drunk, Skellige's Most Wanted).\n\nFlaw-wise, the main story's questing is paced somewhat badly given the arsenal of side quests (common flaw among open-world games); and the very slow setup where the majority of the game is In Ciri's Footsteps. Most side quests are forgettable and are made to artificially fill out the map (e.g., most Witcher Contracts); good sidequests are typically branched off the main quest. Ciri is a little too much of a Mary Sue.\n\nAgree with this take. https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/5f9pv5/so_what_is_it_that_makes_witcher_3_such_an/daimgh3/\n\n__Gameplay.__ The core combat loop is great, pushing on all the best elements of deep combat games like Dark Souls, Dragon's Dogma, and Devil May Cry: swordplay; Sign magic of the magesword variety; and utilities like healing consumables, bombs, crossbows, and torches. Weak and strong attack; target auto-lock; sprint, dodge, and roll; guard and riposte; quick menu for magic/utilities; stamina bar that depletes when sprinting or using magic. I agree with fan consensus however that it is repetitive: there is too little enemy variety to require you to change your rhythm, there are no environmental cues, there is no sense of weight or weapon variety. Fighting shielded, flying enemies, and underwater battles are especially annoying (shields have limited options like no kick; flying requires the slow-reloading crossbow)\n\nI love the quests and dialogue. Reminds me of Elder Scrolls and Fallout, but voiced with an actual character than a fill-in protagonist. There are also other western RPG mechanics that I like as they don't often appear in other games of the genre (see details liked below). A common pattern in quests is that Geralt wipes out a monster infested area, and then people repopulate and start selling services. Or that people can disappear/be missable. It adds to the notion of consequence. There isn't as fancy a stealing/crime/sneak mechanism, environment interaction like looting items and attacking/pickpocketing NPCs, day/night and AI patrol schedules, or tag-a-long companions in this game like Elder Scrolls or Fallout though; or armor types meaning much like in Dark Souls. Many side quests have uninteresting stories as well.\n\nProgression system involves skill points during leveling (including mutations) and Places of Power; mutations; and ARPG/MMO-style equipment (including runestones). Crafting system is fairly deep with blacksmith crafting (repair, upgrade, dismantle), alchemy (toxicity, decoctions, gathering/crafting), and consumables (food, alcohol, potions, oils) The alchemy system with potions, decoctions, and various shrines encourages a \"buff\" game like World of Warcraft which I don't like. But I love the encouragement of mastering one's understanding of decoctions/potions and oils. For example, reading the bestiary for oil weaknesses as you prepare for an enemy. Customization is somewhat limited overall, feeling closer to an action-adventure with no additional weapons with movesets like Dark Souls. This limits replayability but streamlines the game instead of being too complex in terms of building a new class. A one-time completionist playthrough is still satisfactory with enough content: sidequests, location discovery, Places of Power, Treasure Hunt (sometimes which are sidequests), Sunken (Secret) Treasure, and equipment/crafting.\n\nSaving is done by both checkpoints and manual saves (my preferred system). There's inventory load like Elder Scrolls/Fallout and you loot items from random households like Zelda/JRPGs (fortunately, crafting, alchemy, food, and quest items are all free). The detective pieces, occasional horse race, and brawling also add to the diversity.\n\nGwent is a fun, simple minigame with just enough complexity to collect them over the course of the main game. There's not as much variety as the greatest card minigame of all time: Triple Triad. One card to win per merchant ensures you play a good variety of people instead of fixating. Spy is an overpowered mechanic however: card advantage is key like most card games, especially in the beginning when you build up the opponents' score.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ I like the Eastern-European fantasy vibes, with culture like Polish vampire-beings and bestiary being different than what's standard in western fantasy. Gorgeous environments and faces especially for 2015. Combat attacks look like a dance. The kill animations where your last slice rips open the belly of an enemy is an awesome feeling (and it's unique per enemy). Soundtrack is excellent. Dialogue is not just talking heads, an issue even with more modern games like Horizon Zero Dawn. Quest descriptions are more lore-ish with paragraphs when you first get them and not just a list of quest objectives. Some textures and meshes are less attractive though. Head models have too many repeated uses.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Going through the cave with Keira.\n+ The Bloody Baron, the forensic analysis of his wife and daughter's rooms, his nonlinear recollections of Ciri's journey, the blumpkin, Anna as a water hag, and his hanging. That quest chain is certainly one of my favorites of all time with its engaging story and gameplay.\n+ Broken Flowers. The hilarious escapades, and all as an introduction to Dandelion for the first time in the game.\n+ The Play's the Thing. Hiring people, and choosing actors and actresses, and remembering lines. This is like FF7.\n+ The sentient naviety of trolls (and the hilarity particularly of Trollololo in The Volunteer). And how I felt bad killing every last one of them at every option I had in quests for their precious Cave Troll Liver.\n+ Possession. What a haunting sidequest. I especially like the narrative in how it moves about. I am totally seeing this as like a Mushishi/Supernatural episode. The Cerys-Geralt humor with Yennefer is a fun detail for jokes. The Lord of Undvik is also a similar episodic-like short story (with the only annoyance being the quest ordering being bananas to do properly). The whoel chain is fantastic save for the obvious choice of Cerys as the ruler (for a game that's always a choice of lesser evils, this was a dumb choice; would be better if, e.g., Cerys found the right person but was not rewarded properly due to sexism and/or taking longer than Hjalma; or if the lack of evidence ended without Svanrige backing them up).\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ You can haggle for quest rewards. It adds a nice RPG mechanic that's not in the western RPG mainstream like Elder Scrolls.\n+ Lore restricts you to use two different swords, steel for humans and silver for monsters. And oils on your sword for certain monsters.\n+ You can sell at a better rate for junk/food to innkeepers, herbs to herbalists, weapons to blacksmiths, and armor to armourers. Some merchants are also less stingy than others when buying your loot, and each has a limited supply of crowns.\n+ Lower weapon durability degrades the weapon's stats.\n+ You can autofollow roads with your horse. Reminds me of Black Desert Online where the substitute to any fast travel and clicking on a town and autorunning there, in which you can always go faster by using your staminar bar.\n+ Quest descriptions are more lore-ish with paragraphs when you first get them and not just a list of quest objectives.\n+ If there are multiple quest objectives, you can toggle among them to determine which one your directions point to.\n+ All the escorts with you sprint when you sprint. The pacing finally depends on you in escort/follow quests!\n+ You're free to explore the environment but subareas can have much higher-leveled enemies than you are, encouraging you to revisit.\n+ Your sign magic can influence the environment Batman style: break down doors with Aard; light candles with Igni; Jedi mind trick people with Axii.\n+ Console commands like Bethesda games.\n+ There are limited locations to fast travel, and you have to be at certain signs to fast travel rather than being anywhere.\n+ You can skip dialogue on a per-line basis, which in many video games is not possible given that the scenes involve movement.\n+ 21:9 aspect ratio is natively supported as well as borderless!\n+ Immersive HUD where HUD elements disappear after severals econds when theyâre no longer needed.\n+ Even in the hardest difficulty, there's a point to the Mediation/Wait mechanic, which is automatic replenishment of your oils, potions, and bombs if you have hard alcohol.\n+ It's optional to go around to every house in a town/city and loot everything. That's your prerogative. You really only need a specific amount of loot for endgame and making money at the end of the day (https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/37tlbm/psa_you_only_need_a_tiny_amount_of_loot/).\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Witcher 3's detective mode may be the only implementation of it that I'm okay with. It's unintrusive: turn it on and see all the things you can interact with, and that's it. And it only has use cases in forensic analysis and looting scenarios, so there are no cases for it during combat like the Arkham series or Horizon Zero Dawn. And it makes finding loot underwater not as much a pain. And the visual effect is unobtrusive. That said, Witcher 3's detective mode still streamlines the forensic analysis and interactable objects too much, where you rely on highlighted blobs rather than better environment design. I prefer the classic video game design (like with quests) where you have to make your own deduction from clues rather than follow the red color.\n+ At the start of the game and after the prologue, there are (relatively minor) options to determine the events of Witcher 2's impact on the world state of Witcher 3. This is a nice detail but it only impacts a particular conversation, and it can also be an unncessary branching factor where choosing one option has less interesting dialogue. This is similar to Mass Effect and Dragon Age.\n+ You can still mount when over the equipment load. This makes it feasible to loot everything from an area, jump on Roach, then go to the closest fast travel sign to a town to sell everything. This is is convenient but sacrifices some of the purpose of the equipment load.\n+ Invicibility frames during dodging is an upgrade skill rather than core to the dodging mechanic.\n+ Areas being level gated. This sacrifices open world freedom, but the other mainstream alternative is level scaling which is the worse of the two evils. The only solution is to gate levels but reduce the gap.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ It's not clear which dialogue options have a major impact on the rest of the game, and some of them are time-constrained! This makes me hesitant on choosing any dialogue option without resorting to a guide first to know I'm safe to just roleplay.\n+ There are many missables: time-sensitive side quests, certain weapon rewards from missions, gwent cards, mutagens like doppler (only in one quest option) and succubus (only in two quest options), dialogue paths lead to changing events where an NPC who holds a quest, gwent card, or merchandise no longer appears. Similarly, chests that reward you with relic weapons have a random item level. This encourages you to save scum so you can get the highest item level.\n+ You can't target lock onto bosses. Bullshit.\n+ Potions, oils, bombs, and decoctions refill upon meditation with alcohol. This makes them consumables that I didn't feel comfortable using in the early game, but fortunately alcohol is cheap to accumulate in late game.\n+ There's a slideshow recap when loading a new game or traveling worlds. This is unskippable and is a minor waste of 10 seconds; it's a hidden loading screen in any case, signalling long load times. Fortunately it disappears after you beat the game.\n+ There are some doors that are signaled as locked but without keys. That's irritating. Just mark them as not interactable!\n+ Companions during quests are incredibly weak, including powerful sorceresses. Their only use is staggering enemies.\n+ Collect Em All Gwent quest. Nothing keeps track of which Gwent players you've already won a card from and specific cards you're missing. A recent patch did add a somewhat rudimentary tracker though. This makes it difficult to ensure you play with everyone to win the 52 or so cards of out of the 66 total players.\n+ Level requirements on quests are often illogical. For example, Rough Neighborhood is a level 10 quest gated by a level 26 quest.\n+ All sorts of bugs.\n+ So many escort quests, and not the intelligent kind as many NPCs have a fixed movement pace.\n+ Grandmaster Feline armor includes a stupidly angsty hood that covers half the face. I could wear glasses or a mask to remove the hood, but it still covers the Geralt's eyes, which are animated during cutscenes and which I'd rather like to say. Therefore I stuck with Mastercrafted Feline armor and/or other armor I picked up.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki\n+ https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Witcher_3_secondary_quests\n+ http://gwent-cards.com/\n+ map (especially useful for sign posts and places of power) | https://witcher3map.com/, https://mmo4ever.com/witcher/maps/novigrad-no-mans-land-hearts-of-stone/\n+ best merchants to sell | https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=756607382\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/9z5oqw/a_list_of_choices_from_witcher_2_and_everything\n+ steam combat/alchemy build (top-rated as of 2019-12-30) | https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=453260742\n+ FightinCowboy's combat/alchemy build | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ATkGx0iFUE\n+ max dps build for optimal spec and gear | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNFFyScdduI\n\nI played this as my first entry to the series. Witcher 3 is largely touted as the best in the series across aesthetics, environments, main plot, sidequests, progression systems, and combat (the open world and combat of which are significant departure from prior entries). The only contender seems to be Witcher 2 for its story. For any missing knowledge, I Googled and watched Youtube recaps. I watched a playthrough long ago in 2012 up to Bloody Baron and the Keira.\n\nI played for a total of 146 hours (according to Steam). I beat the base game in 103 hours. I completed most all quests, including Collect Em All. I only missed: Hazardous Goods (Velen); A Final Kindness, A Walk on the Waterfront, It Takes Three to Tango (Novigrad); Flesh for Sale (Skellige); and miscellaneous unmarked secondary quests. I did not complete all treasure hunts, scavenger hunts, or discover all locations. I played on the hardest difficulty (Death March) to make the experience more unforgiving and to force a mastery of mechanics like Dark Souls. That said, Witcher 3 combat isn't its strength, and even at this difficulty I'm starting to see the repetition and easiness at level 3 nearing the end of White Orchard where the game feels forgiving. There's so many missables in this game, but I fortunately did not spoil myself by looking at per-quest dialogue decisions. I did a combat/alchemy build with light armor, light attacks, and Quen: combat because that's what this game's all about; and alchemy as it's a unique element to Witcher series. Equipment-wise, I use Cat School Gear, Ekimmara, Katakan, and Ekhidna decoctions, and Swallow potion. Endgame I stuck with Toussaint Knight's Steel Sword (with Preservation runeword), Aerondight (with Severance runeword), and Manticore armor, Nilfgaardian Guardsman's Gauntlets, New Moon Trousers, and Manticore boots (with Levity runeword and Greater Glyph of Mending; no dyes).",

    "comments": "More ambitious addition than Hearts of Stone with a new setting of Touissant culture of knights, colorful fairy tales, vampires, bestiary, Gwent, and more quests. Minor gameplay addition of mutations, dyes (I like grey as black doesn't fully blacken the Cat School Gear's chest armor), grandmaster crafted witcher gear with set bonuses, Corvo Bianco house, and Hanse bases (like Far Cry outposts and any other game). It aims at more than a single narrative as Hearts of Stone but rather Touissant itself as a main character, with exploration and a variety of gameplay enhancements alongside that core story.\n\nStory-wise, the setting is great as well as the sleuthing mystery involving royalty and vampires. Anna Henrietta is a strong character as is Regis and her spicy sister Syanna. Supporting characters remain strong here too like Bootblack the shoemaker. The overall narrative is rather plain though---roughly comparable to Hearts of Stone in my opinion in not fleshing out the characters as well as they could. Dettlaff for example completely fell flat without any backstory for his angst. Also disappointing that Geralt flies solo, without bringing on any of the characters.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Vampire city invasion!\n+ Place and Hill quest. What a different setting that I would not expect in a Witcher 3 medieval Polish fantasy. Love that even the noticeboard has fairy tale characters with postings.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ The bureaucracy trailing of Paperchase: lines, forms, redirecting to other clerks, disinterested customer service.\n+ Aerondight scales to your level, and levels up with you. Lets you pick it up whenever without metagaming.\n+ The Gwent collect em all DLC quest tracks all players!\n+ The parodying with protesters outside the Gwent tournament.\n+ Portrait of a Witcher as an Old Man quest where you pose nude. Equine Phantom where you talk to Roach. These sidequests are Yakuza-level in silliness.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Some stale sidequests made to artifically increase playtime: repetitiveness of Wine Wars, Big Feet to Fill, Knight for Hire, Vitner's Contract.\n\nMy total playtime is 31 hours according to Steam, ending at level 53. I completed all main and sidequests but not treasure hunts. I went down the path of finding Syanna (and giving her the ribbon) instead of seeking out Orianna, as it seems more canonical and fleshed out. I did what I could of Orianna's path, so I only missed the main quests What Lies Unseen, Burlap is the New Stripe, and other endings which I watched on Youtube. The good ending seems too goody and less appealing to Witcher's core dubious morality theme: I think even the most tragic ending like Dettlaff and both sisters dying being quite a good conclusion.",

    "comments": "Fallout 3 stands out as an open-world RPG with opinions: chuck full of humor vibe; desolate scifi apocalypse setting; and first-person shooter+VATS combat system. It otherwise sticks to the staples of Bethesda western open-world RPGs: large worlds with numerous choices across quests and hubs; progression system; memorable characters and sidequests.\n\nFlaw-wise, the FPS combat is clunky. The inventory is also mindbogglingly dense. Bugs.\n\n__Story.__ Stringed together in an Elder Scrolls-like fashion but with even more theme park towns. Main story is mediocre. I think the sidequests are generally better.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Like Elder Scrolls in its RPG mechanics of dialogue, perks/skills, stats, open world, encumbrance, clunky combat, pause-based healing, followers; console; theft via lockpicking and hacking; fast travel. Unique additions like: limb health; environment with tunnels from the metro and Washington, D.C. area; karma; VATS auto-targeting; CND durability and repair; radiation. There are no guilds/factions, a core part of Elder Scrolls' best quest chains and mechanics.\n\nI love that sidequests are few but quality unlike oblivion and Far Cry-style missions, where many side quests end up being redundant (e.g., fetch and quest, or kill a certain elite). Here, side quests are all handcrafted to fit the narrative. This makes it more possible to 100% the side quests, and also not feel like theyâre as redundant (they still can be however because of the stale gameplay or sometimes dullmwriting,but even that is still better than what the formulaic side quests in typical open world rpgs have).\n\nEnemy variety is lacking. Combat is mostly a stand-and-shoot affair, waiting on numbers for you to beat your enemies. There is not much for cover in gunfire, interesting enemy AI, weaving in/out of melee, etc.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Roughly similar to Oblivion, but the colors aren't as washed out. And there are not as many obvious asset reuses in the level designs like in Oblivion (all dungeons and Oblivion gates are the same and clearly feel more empty). Voice acting is more varied.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ The iconic Megaton town in Fallout, a desert hub built with an active nuke at its center.\n+ The satisfying kills after VATS and also from the Bloody Mess perk.\n+ Little detailed quests like the unmarked quest from Andales, a quaint town where everybody has human meat in the refridgerator.\n+ Tranquility Lane, where an old man RPs as a little girl and you're stuck in a small town utopia.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Lighter armor and holstering your weapon makes you move faster.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ VATS system in targeting limbs is largely pointless. The head or chest is the only really viable option. It's never incentivized to disable body parts like it is for example in Horizon Zero Dawn.\n+ There are many partially destroyed objects as part of the aesthetic, and they're unreliable in terms of peaking out to shoot an enemy. It's hard to tell if there's an invisible wall, which is especially punishing with the Gauss rifle where that one blocked shot forces several seconds of reload.\n+ Full of bugs, janky AI movement, lip syncing off, game crashing.\n+ No modern game elements like sprinting, waypoints on map, vehicles, grenade hotkey rather than as the primary weapon, quest indicator and minimap on the main HUD rather than constantly looking at the Pip Boy.\n+ Bad inventory management.\n+ The odd zooming-in and talking heads during dialogue like Oblivion.\n+ No native 21:9 support, but some config changes (http://www.wsgf.org/dr/fallout-3).\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki\n+ GmanLives' review | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-xsYx7VSUQ\n+ setup/troubleshooting guide | https://steamcommunity.com/app/22370/discussions/0/828937546147175081/\n+ https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Forum:Fallout_3_character_builds\n+ https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_3_quests#Main_quests\n\nI played this as the [first entry into the series](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/8uu3ru/which_fallout_game_should_i_play_first/). All other contenders for\"best\" game in the series are sequels: as of 2019, Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 4. I tried this out for an hour a long time ago in 2008. I never got into it like Danny and Dalton. Note I'm evaluating as if Fallout 3 were a completely new IP, and not evaluating based on predecessors' already existent innovations. For posterity, however, I hear that Fallout 3 took the series from its turn-based gameplay to RPG elements with first-person shooter (\"Oblivion with guns\").\n\nI played the Game of the Year edition on mouse and keyboard. This entry's evaluation does not includes the 5 add-ons (DLCs). I played with essential mods which only improve performance or fix bugs: Fallout Script Extender, Fallout Mod Manager, BOSS, 4GB RAM Patch, UPDATED Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch, CASM (autosaves), OneTweak (borderless). I beat the base game and Operation: Anchorage with a total playtime according to the game save of 30 hours. After playing New Vegas I got a reappreciation of Fallout 3, so I decided to play all DLCs and the memorable quests. At this point I added more mods (sorted roughly by importance and/or load order).\n\n+ UI: Immersive HUD (+Adjustable HUD).\n+ Gameplay: Sprint mod.\n+ Textures: NMC Texture Packs.\n+ Lighting/ENB: Fellout, Realistic Interior Lighting, Fallout Street Lights, Megaton Lighting Overhaul, Enhanced Camera, Dynavision.\n\nI played a stealth/sniper build, [the equivalent of Skyrim's stealth archer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/3f1kxi/what_fallout_character_build_is_equivalent_to). My playstyle is snipe from afar, or otherwise rely on VATS to conserve ammo, including kiting when close distance. I followed an [old build](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/939933-fallout-3/46511507) and a [description for Near-Perfection builds which accounts for the Game of the Year Edition's changes like Broken Steel addon with Almost Perfect perk](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Forum:Fallout_3_character_builds), and which prioritizes Educated and Comprehension perks. With Broken Steel, there's a lot more room for error in topping all skills to 100, and getting all 10 SPECIAL stats by simply waiting until the Almost Perfect perk at level 30 and then getting each bobblehead (and if not, you can just use the console). For the SPECIAL starting allocation, I did 9 intelligence, then agi/miscellaneous, and got the Intelligence bottlehead straight from Vault 101. Early game, I did Wasteland Survivor Guide, then Operation: Anchorage to get the Chiense stealth armor, Gauss rifle, and Jingwei's Shocksword as my main staples. I capped certain skills at 60 or 80 due to e.g. item boosts like Chinese Stealth Armor (+15 stealth) and Shady Hat (+5 stealth) as skills are capped at 100, and also to account for skill books.\n\nStealth ranged is typically the best in all Bethesda games because it bypasses Bethesda's persistent flaw of clunky combat (e.g., no dodge, no clear enemy AI on signalled moves, no melee moveset variety). You may as well try to avoid combat by stealthily killing folks from afar, taking advantage of kiting/cover, and conserving resources.\n\ntodo\n\n+ extended dialogue\n+ inventory",

    "comments": "Fallout: New Vegas is Fallout 3 in a desert wasteland and with better dialogue gameplay and quests (some are among the best in gaming history). Most significant is that the story is more detailed, with each faction having reason. Fallout: New Vegas has the most engaging dialogue gameplay I've seen in video games, alongside Morrowind. Fallout New Vegas is closer to a master of player agency and roleplay, closer to Morrowind and Elder Scrolls games in your ability to define your character (not just a chosen one) and his/her relationship with factions.\n\nFlaw-wise, it still has the janky combat of all Bethesda games; overly barren environments without a real sense of exploration, more just point A to B; and bugs.\n\n__Story.__ Main story is fairly mediocre like Fallout 3's, but fortunately not as hackneyed as you're an ordinary courier, not the son of a great scientist. The faction reputation and consequences, and the many sidequests scatted around the different towns each building up reputation/meaning with characters is a significant improvement over Fallout 3.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Mostly the same game as Fallout 3 with slight changes: a slight emphasis on specialization (no chance to get perfect character until very end of late game, fewer skill points per level, perks at every other level instead of every level, traits); iron sights; skills/perks are slightly more streamlined (e.g., Small Guns/Big Guns are just merged as Guns); factions each with a reputation system; ammo subtypes. There's much more depth in dialogue than Fallout 3: (deterministic) skill checks with Barter and Speech; special stats checks; quests/maps/experience purely from navigating the dialogue options.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Engine is the same as Fallout 3. It feels even more barren than Fallout 3, where with the desert wastelands there are just fewer interesting assets. I don't recall as many obviously repatched assets like Morrowind's dungeons and Oblivion gates or Fallout 3's subways.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ The Ghost Town Gunfight mission setting the stage for Fallout's choice of factions and player agency.\n+ The iconic hub of Freeside and its full-of-life-characters like the Kings and the Atomic Wranglers quests.\n+ The assorted Boomer quests in the quest Volare!.\n+ The Ultra-Luxe.\n+ Not knowing any better and taking Boone with me to Crystal Cove. Proceeded to wipe the entire base, then get to the Fort and wonder if this is really going as planned (about 1 hour wasted on whether I want to commit to this, then deciding it's all for the best and I may as well just watch for any of the Legion quests)..\n+ Democracy Inaction was an absolute slog to play. But the surprising realism in its premise is shocking.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Weapon sway depends on if you're standing or not (and like Fallout 3, your gun skill level).\n+ Going through dialogue options, e.g., starts quests, adds to the map, adds/loses fame. This makes listening to the dialogue actually worth it beyond the lore.\n+ Challenge perks. It adds more immersion to how perks arise beyond just leveling.\n+ The mission GPS indicator always tells you where to go and is generally sensible without the need to follow a guide. You're still forced to look things up though for understanding the deep dialogue trees as well as when the simple 2D directions don't work well (e.g., vertical, or needing to get keys to get access to areas/navigating mazes).\n+ Movement speed is tied to light armor and holstering your weapon. Adds to the immersion that for movement you keep your weapon holstered and travel light! No sprint though.\n+ Companions don't die. They only get knocked out for the duration of a fight.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Caravan card game. Literally did not play it once.\n+ Slow motion after every death, not just VAT. I turned it off as it slowed down the game's pace.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Crafting system is not good. It's too inconvenient to access, ingredients unclear, and not necessary if you can just purchase them given the large amount of Caps you get.\n+ Like Fallout 3, VATS system in targeting limbs is largely pointless. The head or chest is the only really viable option. It's never incentivized to disable body parts like it is for example in Horizon Zero Dawn.\n+ You can't play the game anymore after you beat it.\n+ Beating game isn't saved, you have to reload a previous save.\n+ DR/DT and DAM/DPS aren't separate slots but take the same place in stats, fading every second to the other which is annoying.\n+ Too much backtracking in the vaults/dungeon areas, and when going to questgivers that are several loading screens deep.\n+ No native 21:9 support, but some config changes (http://www.wsgf.org/dr/fallout-new-vegas/en).\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas_quests\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/fnv\n+ modding guide | https://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/wiki/moddingguide\n+ track playtime on steam | https://steamcommunity.com/app/22370/discussions/0/648814844765269046\n+ streamlined list of good mods by rika | https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ci3sNT0wcrbjETw4sM7JqlK-zmcjoLqJFSjqhmTjk_0/htmlview\n+ white glove society quests playthrough | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LuNQZA5HFA\n\nI purchased the base game including all DLCs (evaluated separately) and played on mouse and keyboard. My total playtime according to Steam is 43 hours, completing all DLCs and NCR's main missions but not all sidequests or alternative faction playthroughs.\n\nI played with essential mods which only improve performance or fix bugs: New Vegas Script Extender, JIP LN Plugin for NVSE (more script functionality and fixes bugs), NVTF - New Vegas Tick Fix (fixes visual stutter; it added lips out of sync so I removed it altogether), NVAC - New Vegas Anti-Crash, 4GB RAM patch, ini tweaks, Mod Organizer 2, YUP - Yukichigai Unofficial Patch, Unofficial Patch NVSE, CASM with MCM (autosaves), OneTweak (borderless). After 34 hours into the game (on Honest Hearts DLC), I added additional mods (sorted roughly by importance and/or load order).\n\n+ UI: Mod Configuration Menu, Vanilla HUD Remastered 4K, Immersive HUD (+Adjustable HUD).\n+ Textures: NMCs Textures, Wasteland Flora Overhaul, Enhanced Terrain LOD, Effect Textures Enhanced, Improved LOD Noise Texture, Enhanced Camera, Strip Wall Billboards.\n+ Weather: Nevada Skies (+JohnnyGuitar NVSE; ultimately replaced with FNV Realistic Lighting after I encountered a desert storm during Pleasant Road.. unbearable to navigate and fight enemies who have 100% accuracy).\n+ Lighting/ENB: Rudy ENB (I couldn't get the most popular ENB of Enhanced Shaders to perform well), Interior Lighting Overhaul, Dynavision 3, Old World Blues Path Lighting.\n\nAs much as I wanted to alter gameplay with sprint, dynamic crosshair, and character face overhauls, I couldn't feel comfortable switching it without a full first playthrough.\n\nI played a [stealth sniper build](https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/11/02/fallout-new-vegas-scout-sniper-hardcore-guide-1131544), with 8 Agility and 5 Intelligence. My skills were Guns, Sneak, Repair, Speech (lots of unique quest mechanics from dialogue), then slowly added Lockpicking, Science. I used only Light armor for maximum movement speed. I played a bit with weapons until I got the Ratslayer then Sniper Rifle (which I only slightly prefer over Anti-Material Rifle due to more abundant ammo/repair and silencer; though I prefer AMR's slower-but-heavier attacks and flashy kills), then stuck primarily with a sniper except in close combat situations where VATS is not enough so I switched to a shotgun/melee. I chose to side with NCR over Legions as the designers clearly put a gameplay advantage for them: companions, significant map presence, etc. I also favored diplomatic routes when possible. Some choices I made: NCR among the four factions; Birds of a Feather, killing Cass; Rey Brain for Rex; weapon upgrade for ED-E. I completed all DLCs in chronological order once I hit level 20 and did not complete the last piece of the main story until I completed all DLCs.",

Enemies are bullet sponges. The DLC overall can be summarized as a 30-40 minute exposition dump followed by fetch quests. No world-building exploration, player agency, interesting environments, balanced enemies, new companions. X-8 Data Terminal Retrieval quest is a good example of how bad it is: you complete the Basic Test, fine it's typical of Fallout, then the Advanced Test which is exactly the same but with some replaced enemies, then you fetch a key, then you do the Basic and Advanced Tests all over again!

New enemies, items, etc. Characters are memorable: Father Elijah; Dog/God. Starting from scatch makes you more aware of your limited ammo/arsenal and incentivizes you to explore. The traps make you take a more deliberate pacing. The story overall is engaging.\n\nI enjoy its difficulty and linear-but-with-corners-for-exploration design (as with, e.g., Souls and platformers). But it's unnecessarily frustrating at times, where even with savescumming, the radio/speaker bombs, traps, clouds, resurrectable enemies, holograms can all get on your nerves. The radio/speaker bombs were just the worst. I thought the survivalist approach is a breath of fresh air to Fallout, bringing it closer to the likes of horror shooters like Half-Life, Resident Evil, Dead Space. But it grows old even within its 5 hour playthrough.",

    "comments": "The story is not as good as Yakuza 0, and neither is the gameplay. It was a fun playthrough but not necessarily groundbreaking by any means. My favorite elements are the Cabaret Club and improved textures.\n\n__Story.__ More ambitious and less melodramatic than Yakuza Kiwami to its benefit. Clearly with its strong primary characters, Yakuza Kiwami 2 set the precedent for future titles' multiple protagonist take (to Yakuza 0's story benefit for example).\n\n__Gameplay.__ I like the combat based on Yakuza 6 rather than Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami's combat. Namely, there are no combat fighting styles for its simplicity, but I actually prefer the variety in trying out all three styles (each of which had some use case in Yakuza 0: moving around speedily; brawler-style CC and automatically picking up items when attacking; and the general-purpose one). Progression system is similar, spending experience points. New combat wise are charge attacks, more weapons, situation-based heat moves.\n\nCabaret Club 2.0 from Yakuza 0?? Yes please! Cabaret club is easily my favorite Yakuza minigame and one of the best parts of the series. I would play a game dedicated just to the Cabaret Club. In Yakuza Kiwami 2, Cabaret Club is also the most efficient way to get income, so there's a gaming incentive to grinding in it. They add to it just a bit with Oil Barons, four passive perk abilities that don't really do much, timed dialogue options, but otherwise the exact same structure. That core structure is excellent: progression/management with recruiting/lineups/leveling, platinum hostesses, a cheesy story, pseudo-dating, how the game interacts with the rest of the city making it feel overall more alive.\n\nSide quests aren't as memorable as Yakuza 0. They're fairly linear and not as spunky.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Incredible graphics upgrade from Yakuza Kiwami. Textures are mroe detailed, lighting is more realistic. HUD is cleaner. You can enter stores/buildings without a loading screen! I like the regional accents.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Playing the Cabaret Club at 4am in the morning, just optimizing my arsenal of cabaret girls.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Unlike other games, there's an actual incentive to eating at restaurants aside from completionism, which is gaining EXP. Therefore you always want to fill his stomach when you can.\n+ Unlike Yakuza 0, there are no suboptimal answers during dialogue options in substories. This means you don't have to follow substory guides so you don't miss out on a reward.\n+ Native 21:9 support. The pre-rendered cutscenes are pillarboxed properly.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ You no longer need to go to a phonebooth to save. More streamlining, less lore/mechanics.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ I have mixed feelings about all the reused assets in this game borrowed from previous games. It makes the game feel less new and more already played out, whether it be the map, some animations, etc.\n+ While there's JAV actresses in this game for the Cabaret Club Grand Prix, there's less JAV/softcore content overall than Yakuza 0 (e.g., the nude girl telephoto cards that you pick up, Marina in the real estate game). I liked having these as it adds charm to the game.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.neoseeker.com/yakuza-kiwami-2/walkthrough\n\nI played on Easy as I don't find the combat difficulty necessarily fun. I like to play the brawling more mindlessly. Progression-wise, I favored life skills and then spread points around stats, battle moves, and heat moves. Playing a week in hiatus for NeurIPS, I found my save file corrupted (name of the save file disappears when trying to laod; playtime hour count is 0; https://steamcommunity.com/app/927380/discussions/0/1652170487948228129/). Luckily, one of my backup saves kept me close story-wise, and the major portion I lost was 100% progress on the Cabaret Club (had to redo Chapter 8; maybe 8 hours of screwing around from Cabaret Club).",

Unfortunately the game is also extremely unforgiving at times and janky with camera angles and controls.\n\n__Story.__ Love the humor to the game.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The combat is hack and slash that's quite a bit janky from PlayStation 1 era. No dodge button. There are two moves (Square and Circle), but only the charged up Circle attack is really viable (you want to minimize time near enemies as that's the only way you can reduce damage taken). There's also many ranged weapons with limited ammo that forces you to spend gold. Triangle lets you swap between two weapons, which is fine but not as diverse as the D-pad 4-choices common in PlayStation 4 games. Camera angles are janky. Heals are auto-use.\n\nI like the level design. I'm a big fan of hand-crafted mostly linear levels, and with collectibles off the beaten path. This game encourages exploration well by forcing you to kill all enemies and find the location to the chalice, which lets you unlock more powerful weapons. Enemy variety is also good. The hints but never pedantic throughout the levels are all well-done.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Vibrant colors. Love the cartoon art.

    "comments": "Star Wars took me pleasantly by surprise. The game plays like a mix of Uncharted, Tomb Raider reboot, and Dark Souls. It builds on each of these game's elements very well, and while it adds few innovations, I thoroughly enjoyed the mix of elements from my favorite action RPGs/action-adventures. This is what a AAA title should be like: cinematic, methodical in its exploration/level design, well-paced in its combat, light puzzle solving, simple but fundamental action buttons and progression systems. We can do with less open-world AAA titles, shooters, and multiplayers, and I'm glad this Star Wars game took chances!\n\nFlaw-wise, it's enemy variety and backtracking not only for collectibles but even in the main story where you revisit planets and traverse through most of the same areas.\n\n__Story.__ Story follows the prototypical underdog story which is serviceable but not very interesting. Cere is an interesting character. The Sith villain feels like playing the diversity card as an Indian female. Same goes for Cere as a black female. I think what perturbs me the most isn't that there's diversity, but that the main character remains a young white male and built off conventional attractive stereotypes. It's like a white male fantasy.\n\n__Gameplay.__ I love the core mechanics, building on Dark Souls for combat and exploration, and Uncharted in the cinematic experience. Attacks are light and heavy with dodge, block, and parry based on Dark Souls, paired with core force abilities as utilities. Dark Souls style bonfires for healing and checkpoints. XP is regained by attacking enemies similar to Bloodborne's blood echoes. Artifacts, cosmetics, and force essence encourage exploration off the main path. Progression system is skill tree and lightsaber and armor customization. For a AAA game, I'm so glad it doesn't have open world elements.\n\nI admire the deviations that distinguishes Star Wars a bit: for example, the use of the lightsaber to light up dark areas; parrying ranged attacks to bounce back ranged shots; Force Dash is viable for enemies like flamethrowers; guarding is a lot more free in this game as attacks/sprinting doesn't deplete the stamina bar; the adversarial plants to make platforming more interesting in Kashykk; dual lightsaber and Force Push for crowd control.\n\nEnemy variety is not good. Mobs are re-used for bosses. Bosses are re-used as mobs. Too many storm troopers, not many interesting creatures. Bosses are just not very aggressive; they're too easy.\n\nI really like how labyrinthian and open in pathing the level design is. Definitely Dark Souls in this regard. I love that feeling of trying to explore every crevice to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ It's a really good looking game. Lighting, textures, face models. Builds well on the Star Wars universe by showing diverse races. Star Wars symphony music. Cutscenes are rendered in game. Same scenes are a bit janky and performance is bad. Most notable aesthetics-wise is how bare everything is: there's no densely populated areas, so it can feel strange as a Star Wars title as it's primarily in wilderness, and in the one rebel outpost, there's just a dozen people standing around.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ The train to imperial hallway sequence very early in the game (https://www.reddit.com/r/FallenOrder/comments/dwy5pz/about_that_part_in_the_beginning/). (Same happens when you go back to Zeffo and start climbing a wall. I love these point of view changes overall.)\n+ All the flashback sequences as young Cal the padawan and with Anakin-style hair.\n+ Getting lost in Zeffo for the umpteenth time.\n+ Laughing immediately when they show the double jump being a front flip in mid air to ascend higher distances. Absolutely a Crash Bandicoot thing.\n+ Spending an hour fighting Malicos over and over until I memorized his mechanics over stages. He's the only boss that I had to switch strategies: block instead of dodge, and a single light saber with very specific usage of Force with dual light saber attack for DPS/damage to his stamina bar. I love how aggressive he gets over time, and how he starts to chain moves so if you get too acquanted with the rhythm in the first stage, you get fucked. Other fights I had to patient with retries with: Umbaran fight club arena, about a dozen tries for Silla at final level.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ On platforming, I like that you need to press an additional action to hold onto the railing once you land the jump. This makes it a bit less automatic and snoozy as Uncharted and Tomb Raider platforming.\n+ Psychometry as a lore reason for finding artifacts.\n+ There's no extraneous currency or material item system. This makes it easier to manage less and also so that you don't need to pick up anything from corpses.\n+ Runs to bosses are not far.\n+ You can use Force abilities without depleting your bar when not in combat.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ No stamina bar depletion as you sprint or attack. It's only for guards.\n+ Holo map. Having a map is mostly unnecessary. But I do find it useful to keep track of all the missable routes I didn't take due to the metroidvania.\n+ Specific skills in the skill tree. They all feel fairly inconsequential and/or are stat boosts. Then again, I wouldn't want the skill tree to have an arsenal of overly complex fighting moves like God of War and Devil May Cry's tend to.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Several bosses are just bigger versions of the same enemy. No different mechanics.\n+ Performance issues at times, primarily frame rate drops.\n+ Metroidvania style of blocking certain small subareas as you haven't acquired the requisite ability. I think metroidvania is only done well if the new content is a path to a much larger area. Blocking off just a handful of collectibles makes the game feel more tedious as bookkeeping. There's too much backtracking in this game.\n+ Swimming mechanic. Boring.\n+ The parry mechanic (for melee attacks) is not great, making it not really viable compared to guard or dodging (https://www.reddit.com/r/FallenOrder/comments/dx82ny/why_parry_in_this_game_feels_harder_than_in_dark/).\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI played max difficulty (Jedi Grand Master) and on second-to-highest settings (High). I beat the game in 21 hours according to Steam. I actually found Grand Master to still be fairly forgiving, at least compared to Soulsborne. Skill tree-wise, I prioritized survivability and improvements to core lightsaber moves and Force mana. Once I got the double bladed lightsaber I ended up always using it; it's like a Dex-style build in Dark Souls: weaker damage but many more attacks. It also just works significantly better with crowd control.\n\nI played this as I was itching for a deep combat Souls-like game, but with a short-to-medium playtime as I'll be away next week for Thanksgiving. Of the Souls-like deep combat games, I haven't played Witcher III or Monster Hunter World yet. Others I haven't played seem fairly derivative, and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is the most mainstream of these even though I expect nothing new in its offering.",

    "comments": "Dragon Quest VIII stands out as a core entry of the series, outlining its strengths: fantastic art and soundtrack, bright atmosphere and characters, and well-done classic RPG/combat mechanics and story. On flaws, Dragon Quest 8 has quite a bit of gold and experience grinding, which dilutes its content. To enjoy this game, I had to treat it like Pokemon and any comfy game like Harvest Moon. This still did not serve my patience for the 60 hour game content. Story is serviceable but not great.\n\n__Story.__ Prototypical story but filled with a few colorful characters. I especially like Yangus, King Trode, Morrie. Fortunately there's also not much drama or cringey dialogue as, e.g., Final Fantasy games. The story isn't really memorable and certainly does not stand out compared to the likes of stellars in the genre such as Dragon Quest V, Chrono Trigger, and Final Fantasy 6. The villain after Dhoulmagus is Final Fantasy-levels of generic cosmic villain. Dhoulmagus also isn't as indepth as the other infamous clown: Kefka.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Dragon Quest 8 plays the same as the rest in the series but with two newly introduced mechanics: Skill Tree and Alchemy System. Levels provide stat boosts and skill points to upgrade via skill tree system. Like the rest of the series, Churches provide save points, resurrection, and status effect removal. Uniquely to this game in the series (3DS version), there is Quick Save. Stat attribute and status effect system is fundamental and works well, without complicated other stats. The 3D turn-based combat reminds me most of Pokemon Stadium. I like the unique perks of battle mechanics in Dragon Quest games: Defend, Psyche Up, and number of enemies going up to 10s in a battle and with specific group formation patterns that determine your multi-target abilities, and where multi-target DPS outshines single-target in most all encounters.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Love the orchestral soundtrack. Visuals are colorful and varied, loving Akira Toriyama's character and monster design especially. Bestiary builds on the excellent one from the series. Voice acting is excellent (Takehito Koyasu's Dio and many more as Dhoulmagus!). Wonderful atmosphere overall.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ The ol' Dragon Quest workflow of exploring a new town by entering every house, breaking all their vases and jars, and scouring their drawers.\n+ Puppeteer enemy CCing your party members by telling them a funny story. So wholesome.\n+ The classic JRPG style of a story/gameplay length that outstays its welcome and the reliance on color palette swaps for novel enemy variety as the game progresses.\n+ The combat rhythm of Psyche Ups, Attacks, and Multiheals during boss encounters.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Enemies appear on-screen on map to select battles (in DS version). This is such a huge quality-of-life improvement, particularly a dozen or so hours into the game where you'd like to avoid random encounters. At this point, it's more optimal to appreciate the game content without the dilution, and to grind any missing experience/gold efficiently through Metal Slime means.\n+ While I don't like the general idea of grinding to unnecessarily elongate a game's playtime, I do like some of the habits you get into with grinding in Dragon Quest. For example, finding the optimal strategy and spending an hour or two in Slime Hill.\n+ Difficulty curve. The hardest bosses are also lore-wise the hardest: Dhoulmagus, Empyrea, Rhapthorne. I game over-ed a few times making these fights feel challenging but not enough that they become frustrating (boy it must have been so much tougher without a walkthrough!).\n+ Day night cycle. Not many changes in the NPC/world event patterns  but I like the ones that do.\n+ I liked all the modes of transportation on the world map: Sabrecat, ship. They all had simple movement operations and mount/unmount. Except the bird which automoves and takes forever to pivot..\n+ The use of photographs for Cameron's Codex as the collectible. I don't collecting these as intrusive as other collectibles in games (certainly ones in open-world RPGs). They aren't extremely gamey but rather immerse you well into the details of the world.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Items go into a bag which must be then put into character-specific bags to equip or use them. I don't know of modern games beside Dragon Quest that does this: extra degree of nuisance but extra degree of mechanics complexity.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Camera navigates with L/R shoulders and Up/Down D-pad rather than right stick.\n+ Unfortunately, cutscenes and text don't scale as the engine does. So on a 1440p monitor, the game's cutscenes are super blurry and in clear contrast to the upscaling of the rest of the game. Draw distance is also pretty bad.\n+ If you're not careful in the save options, you can quit the game __without__ saving (https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/7xpea8/dragon_quest_viii_3ds_why_would_you_ask_the/).\n+ Only partial voice acting. Common for games at the time.\n+ Citra does well most of the time. Frame rate drops when monsters pop in though. And game is capped at 30 FPS.\n+ You can lines of dialogue to speed it up, but certain lines wait on a particular animation, which makes it awkward to hear silence while the animation is played out. I'd much rather have those lines just not be skippable.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/3ds/160146-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/77496/\n+ liquid metal slime grind and respawn trick in trodain castle | https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/160146-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/74893054\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/3dshacks/comments/6kuwmc/the_orchestra_restoration_and_undub_mods_for/\n\nI played it using the Citra 3DS emulator, USA ROM with undubbed (Japanese voice acting and English everything) and orchestra restoration mods. Quoting https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/5866-the-complete-beginner-s-guide-to-dragon-quest-part-1-main-titles:\" The Mobile version has performance issues, so it's better to skip that version. The 3DS version is considered the definitive version with new playable characters, a turbo speed mode, and extra content including a new optional ending. However, the PS2 version is quite fine on its own and has a full orchestral soundtrack which the 3DS version lacks (although the orchestral soundtrack can be added to the 3DS version of the game through unofficial modification).\" The PS2 version apparently is prettier via its upscaling on an emulator and with a better menu system and no censoring, but it's not as complete as 3DS (e.g., quality of life changes such as quick save, on screen encounters, sped up battles, instant alchemy; and extra content such as playable characters, endgame content).\n\nMy total playtime is 32 hours (according to save game data). I followed the skill tree recommendations from the walkthrough. The walkthrough does not include a guide on how to allocate Seeds. Following discussion (https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/64734374), I give Strength and Skill to Hero; HP (Life), Defense, MP (Magic), and Wisdom to Jessica as she's most glass-cannony; Agility to Angelo for faster healing. The Speed option for battles can quickly be abused and make you not appreciate the animations. I deliberately only turned it on when grinding or running from point A to B where I've already been in the region before but ended up keeping it on after about 20 hours into the game (many enemies are palette swaps or offer not-so-unique animations). I did not complete all Sidequests, including the treasure hunting sections of the guide, the Baccarat Casino, and the last optional section before the final boss (https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/3ds/160146-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/77496/treasure-hunting-magic-key). I also did not use the two playable characters or do the endgame which are new to the 3DS version.",

    "comments": "Horizon Zero Dawn is a decent open-world RPG with polished bow-and-arrow combat and its own spin on a tribal world reawakening from a technologically infested wilderness. The store is serviceable but not great. Same goes for progression systems, stealth, and combat. Side quests are bad.\n\n__Story.__ Prototypical story tropes of an outcast of a tribe. Setting of tribal politics is interesting. And the overall presentation and characterization is enough in the beginning to make it enjoyable from its polish (not unlike God of War (2018)). It progresses as drivel and is a bore. Characters are not interesting. 1-dimensional Mary Sue as the original of Aloy's gene, as well as the stupidity of Ted Faro.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Horizon Zero Dawn plays like a Far Cry/Tomb Raider/Ubisoft title, Spider Man, God of War, and others of its genre but in a polished style that adds highlights from strengths of the genre. On the level of sameness, it's an open world with exploration, HUD of things to pick up/interact/quests, collectibles, crafting, skills. Similarly, combat is a mix of stealth, archery, and platforming. Even animations and quick crafting are very similar. The changes from the formula, sometimes inspired by other games, do make it interesting: more complex bestiary than Far Cry, weak/strong melee attack like Dark Souls, trap weapons, Concentration skill slows down enemy to line up your shot (making archery at specific parts more viable), tracking enemy patrol paths, enemy weak points, investigating clues Batman Arkham-style, head vs head dialogue with little else moving (which I find awkward in all games like this), flashpoints (closer to dialogue options in games like Elder Scrolls/Fallout), little stat scaling based on levels but rather equipment and an emphasis on weakpoints/weapon variety mechanics for endgame combat.\n\nOn the open world system, Horizon Zero Dawn exhibits a worrying trend that I find in 2010-2020 open world games: streamlining. Questgivers typically have interesting dialogue and offer specific directions about how to reach any next point. But questmarkers make it obvious where to go such that that dialogue is no longer important. Detective mode for tracking footprints/blood trails makes it unnecessary to actually examine the environment around you; instead you follow the path given by your HUD. Detective mode also highlights enemy weaknesses and weak body parts rather than you figuring it out yourself. Platforming is simply moving the D-pad in the right direction so that the character does heroic leaps and all you pay attention to are cliff point A to cliff point B. Side quests, collectibles, and other open world elements can feel rather drab, which is especially unfortunate as this soaks up the majority of one's playtime; I would much prefer a denser game that just cut out those sidequests and focused on the main missions. Overall, you can tell that the open-world games like these are designed formulaically by first, positing the space of a zone, and then filling it with a variety of assets. I significantly prefer Dark Soul's approach, where players are encouraged to explore every crevice of an area because of human-designed locations of loot, and loot that is missable; these games just have generic lootboxes and collectible numbers.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The CGI is integrated very well with human faces. Lighting and textures are excellent. There's a good variety of areas from wilderness to dungeons, and under a variety of weather conditions.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Watching all the pivotal and emotional cutscenes via cheesy holograms.\n+ Hipshot spam firing Hardpoint Arrows to take down components of enemies. What a great feeling.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Stealth indicator with a reasonable number of gradations for both sound and visibility. I like this in stealth games because it displays the actual stealth mechanic involved. While no indicator is better for immersion, it's unclear in many stealth games if sound and visibility make any gameplay difference.\n+ No currency system, all items are the currency.\n+ Fast travel is limited in beginning then more readily available once you purchase the Golden Travel Pack.\n+ Good uses of vibration in controller. Even landing a jump which makes the game feel overall more responsive.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Flashpoints (player choice in the narrative) do not have a major impact on the story.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Detective mode. Fortunately it restricts movement in this game, which limits its overall use but it is still intrusive.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://horizonzerodawn.fandom.com/wiki/\n+ Alert system. If you hit an enemy with caution status, they automatically go into red and know where you are even if you're sniping from very far away.

I played on Normal difficulty (https://www.reddit.com/r/horizon/comments/7loqmu/which_difficulty_is_recommended_for_first_time/). I beat the game in 22 hours according to the save game data. I used dynamic HUD. I did not complete all sidequests, Hunting Grounds, etc. I prioritized harvesting/gathering skills and upgrades, then stealth and the occasional ranged and melee upgrades. My playstyle is stealth until I get caught. Melee for only situational DPS. Hunter Bow with Hardpoint Arrows for general DPS and taking down weak points and Hunter Arrows for cheaper use (e.g., against humans). Sharpshot Bow for Tearblast Arrows to strip any specific components and Precision Arrows for sniping. For more defensive battles (e.g., strong large enemies), I used the War Bow's Freeze Arrows for CC. While non-bow weapons are interesting from a design perspective, I don't find their uses any better than the equivalent bow which competes for the same feature (e.g., War Bow vs Sling for freeze CC, Sharpshot Bow vs Tearblast for tearing down components). Reading online, this is what everyone seems to have converged to as well.",

    "date_finished": "11/2/19",
    "comments": "Standing among the Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy series, the Tales series ranks as the third most popular JRPG series in Japan (with Atlus' rising Persona series closing in). Tales distinguishes itself by embracing anime culture and a real-time combat system, and where Symphonia pioneered the 3D battle with a 2.5D movement system. Symphonia shines most in its combat, chibi art style, and characters, which are all appealing but not necessarily genre-defining. Other elements also just don't stand out: the plot is lackluster; progression system, soundtrack, enemy, and bosses are all serviceable. The game also drags on with its repetitiveness, going through ever so many of the same similar-ish dungeons. Symphonia would be much better as a denser game without the 50 hour playtime expectation, where I felt going through the second half to be a chore as it continued to stretch its content. From what I've heard, Tales of the Abyss and Tales of the Vesperia are also victims of this problem.\n\n__Story.__ It's a trite story filled with high fantasy jargon of saving a world by uncovering Seals, betrayal, a twin world, and saving again while with a motley crew. It meanders over its 50 hour playtime and can be difficult to follow at times (\"wait, why do we need to retrieve this specific item again?\"). The characters are charming. This is my first \"anime\"-style JRPG, so it's interesting to see how the various tropes like a girl's clumsiness or tsundere behavior plays into a JRPG. Lloyd reminds me of an anime-based FFX's Tidus (although Lloyd came first). Wonder Chef is a fun side.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Most unique to the Tales series (and first introduced in Symphonia) is the 3D, fencing-like real-time battle system. I like the ideas here in hack-and-slash while controlling for defense via block mechanics, stagger, and positioning for AOE attacks, and aerial vs standing enemies. There's certainly still room for improvement compared to deeper combat mechanics games like Nier: Automata and Dark Souls: proper dodge, parry/riposte, environment (e.g., wall hit collision), clearer enemy attacks, skills that have more variety in their mechanics than simple moveset changes with a different damage stat. Enemies wander around in the map and battles are occur in a separate (2.5D) instance like Dragon Quest and Earthbound. Optional cooking mechanic after every battle. Unison attack as a party-based limit breaker. Gald currency. Grade system as a secondary currency, letting you carry over things to new game plus. Other RPG mechanics are standard, e.g., large party, each following a class archetype, HP, TP (mana), levels, status effects.\n\nProgression system is threefold: exspheres and T/S exskills act as skill upgrades; titles serve as an additional stat boost for levels similar to an exchangeable Pokemon EV system; and item customization allows the reuse of old weapons via upgrading them given additional crafting material. It's not great in that it's simply a matter of allocation with little build variety, but it's also not bad. The customization is flawed for completionists unfortunately as there's only a finite amount of crafting material (unless one looks through walkthroughs on what enemies to farm), making it difficult to ever make a decision on what to spend an upgrade for the customization. I ended up not ever using it.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ I like the chibi anime artstyle; it makes the game distinctive. Mix of voiced and non-voiced dialogue. Cutscenes are almost all rendered ingame, which is good but also kind of dumb how stupid the interactions can be given the lack of facial expression and movement. Regions designed across the world are not as diverse and rich as, say, FFX. World map is also bland. Enemy bestiary lacks the unique designs that make certain races or enemies iconic in the FF and DQ series. Sound and enemy design is only serviceable. Camera angle is bad at times, especially on world map navigation.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Dreading the platforming in the Temple of Lightning, constantly falling off in the half-obscured rooms.\n+ The constant framerate dips, particularly in windowed mode if I don't have the game as the active window. Hard to tell if it's the vanilla game or the customization with, e.g., high-res textures injected in that caused all these issues.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+  I like the skits. They remind me of FF9's mechanic, offering more depth to the characters and their relationships via miniature happenstances.\n+ Nonrandom encounters. It allows you to control when to fight trash such as boss pathing vs grinding.\n+ Keeping old equipment is encouraged through the customization shop.\n+ When you pick up an item, although you don't get to see a description of what it does right away, the item appears as the first one in the Items inventory. This makes it easy to pick up, say, an upgrade, and instantly know who to equip it to.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Katz exploration team. NPCs you pay to get you any missed items or monsters.\n+ You need to optimize stats a bit by taking into specific stat boosts from titles in comparison. Fortunately, you can farm herbs end game in order to get perfect stats.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ You learn new spells by equipping a certain level of EX gem, using their previous spell a number of times, and reaching a prerequisite level. This is similar to FF8's junctions and FF9's abilities attached to equipment. I hate this mechanic because it requires micromanaging how to use items across your party rather than a per-character upgrade system.\n+ You can't speed up the text in skits or skip cutscenes. Annoying..\n+ A large number of missables such as titles and items. Tales games since then have reduced the number of missables.\n+ Skits can be hard to specifically trigger. This makes it difficult if you want to see all of them, especially ones that unlock certain items. It would be great if there were, e.g., a list of skits that you've unlocked so you can at least keep track.\n+ EX Gems are finite, meaning you need to deliberately select how to use them. You can only purchase them from the Grade shop, which is better spent for new game plus.\n+ Stats like Accuracy/Evasion seem largely worthless. Thrust/Slash seems like an unnecessary difference given the sameness of their combat mechanics.\n+ Navigation with vehicles like Noishe, boat, and Rheaird flight are intuitive and clunky.\n+ Guidestone monuments and long range mode seems largely worthless.\n+ Slide puzzles. What a pain.\n+ Getting lots of frame stutter and the occasional game crash.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ overall description about pc release | https://steamcommunity.com/app/372360/discussions/0/487870763319924065/\n+ tsfix mod | https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=618359790\n+ best guide (gamecube-based, does not include affection and monuments although not game-changing) | https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gamecube/561316-tales-of-symphonia/faqs/42708\n+ guidestones | http://www.kaoticsilence.com/talessymphoniaps2/tosps2monuments.html\n+ guide on gamecube to ps3 | https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gamecube/561316-tales-of-symphonia/faqs/32765/\n+ exskills guide | https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/920235-tales-of-symphonia/faqs/61238, https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gamecube/561316-tales-of-symphonia/answers/36411-what-are-the-best-compound-ex-skills-for-each-charachter-and-how-do-i-get-them\n\nI started with this game as it's: the earliest 3D Tales game and therefore will let me appreciate future games' advances and not depreciate earlier games; is the best-selling title of the series; is ranked as one of the best (https://www.reddit.com/r/tales/comments/9ls7d0/which_game_is_the_best_to_start_the_series_off/, http://i.imgur.com/YBxYa9I.jpg). Other contenders to play as the best in the series are Abyss, Vesperia (Definitive Edition on Windows in 2019), and Berseria.\n\nI played on PC, which is the remastered version for PS3 but with more bug fixes and higher resolution. I completed the game in 34 hours (according to Steam). The remastered version includes improved textures and environments, dual-audio, more attacks, costumes, and sidequests. The only advantage of Gamecube original version is 60 fps over PC's 30. The TSFix mod apparently fixes framerate and other issues from the launch, but it's hard to trust given its autoinstaller and that the game has updated since then (it's unclear what benefits it does bring). I played with it as the game actually wouldn't launch natively. I also used the 4K texture mod as it doesn't seem to add any noticeable artstyle differences and is a strict upgrade (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-ig6iU1kwg). Like any JRPG, I played with a walkthrough and Japanese audio. I used a walkthrough for selecting how to allocate EX Skill Gems. As it was released originally on Gamecube, I played on controller. I played on Normal difficulty, the recommended one for first timers. I was originally motivated to play after having played Nier: Automata, and therefore being hungry for a story-based game with real-time action. I completed most missables/content but skipped any tedious ones (e.g., Colette the dog lover, Palmacosta Pro, Zelos the gigolo). Party composition-wise, I played with everyone with no strong preferences, cycling among them to equally distribute experience.",

    "comments": "Nier stands out as an action RPG with a great bleak story, hack-and-slash and bullet hell mechanics, progression system, and soundtrack. The transitions from hack-and-slash to minigame-like mechanics are especially notable in breaking up the gameplay. The open world, side quests, voice acting, enemy design, and overall level design are serviceable.\n\nOn weaknesses, Nier's most significant are twofold: 1. its Hard difficulty is unforgiving, with enemy attacks that aren't well-telegraphed and possible to see in the visual chaos that defines Nier's combat. With the generous iframes for Evade, you often spend battles Evade spamming while your ranged does the bulk of the DPS. Even Dark Souls doesn't have that in addition to many enemies one-shotting you. 2. Route B is too repetitive, playing more like a mandatory new game plus. It's a nice concept but gimmicky in practice. Even Route C has too many reused assets. It would be preferable if they condensed these two routes instead of diluting the playtime.\n\n__Story.__ Given Yoko Taro's reputation, the plot is surprisingly better than I thought it would be! The overall Nier-Drakengard universe is ridiculous (see any youtube summary). But Nier Automata's plot fits well by itself, particularly in the plot twists and despite the many plot holes. I also like the ambition in the different endings, particularly with different perspectives to the same story and with a total of 3 playable characters. And the ambition in its bleakness, almost like an Evangelion conclusion (but without the great depth in the characters and plot development to back up the ending). Pascal selling his village's body parts. ROFL.\n\nUnfortunately, the redundancy in route B is bad as it's largely the same for the most hours as it's from 9S' perspective with new sidequests, making players think Ending A is literally most of the game but arguably worse as the gameplay differences are minor and matter most in removing your Heavy Attack (https://www.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/69wq47/when_people_think_they_finished_nierautomata/dhaesh3/). There are many gaps in the plot that are more a sign of forgetfulness than being purposefully left out.\n\nThe characters aren't as well-written as the fans say there are. I can't recall a single unique interaction or dynamic that defines character relationships. 2B acts like a mix of Rei Ayanami and Motoko Katsunagi, etc.\n\nThe themes are depicted amateurly at times, like what defines humanity via robots, existentialism, etc. As an AI researcher, the way fiction deals with this (especially as is common in Japanese pseudo-science fiction like Stein's Gate and Psycho Pass) is naive and trite. I find I enjoy it more flippantly as if it were a mere setting for anime characters to do their thing. It seems common for 2010-2020 anime fans to find these \"deep\". Take the Animal Care quest for example. \"[After a laborious fetch quest to get medicine] Having bodies seems so inconvenient. I wonder why one should have one. But at least they're warm.\", sending the implication that there's a tenderness to human fragility. But that's actually not true. You can make robots have soft skin and be warm too. That's just a combination of texture and expending energy. Similarly, I find it strange how much Nier Automata has to anthropomorphize everything, and make some artificial distinction among the levels of consciousness in Pods, Machines, and Androids.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Nier gameplay is a mix of hack and slash, bullet hell, and a variety of minigame like mechanics such as 2D platforming and flight as it changes up the game to keep the gameplay options diverse. The diversity is what keeps it from growing stale albeit it does in routes B and C (~20 playtime hours in). 9S can hack and control enemy units. You can play albeit briefly as a robot and later, Pascal. Then 9S as himself in the hacking zone. Cutscenes on the loading screen. Joke endings. etc.\n\nI also like the core combat mechanics of weak attack, strong attack, their variety based on press vs hold, and their occasional variety based on what other weapon is equipped; ranged weak and strong attack (I also like that Hard and Very Hard don't have lock-on, which I find to add too much to my mental model of controls); and evade. The use of ranged and melee reminds me of God of War. The fast running with evade feels awesome. I love just navigating the world and platforming. I love how balanced the game is in incentivizing ranged vs melee. I love how the flight sections borrow most combat elements from the hack and slash. The combat is not deep---there is no backstab/parry/riposte, well-designed enemy movesets, dodges are spammable, you can get by often with just ranged DPS---but it works well enough to remain fun.\n\nNier features RPG progression mechanics, upgrading your weapons, pod, and chipset. I especially like the chipset upgrade system. It's unique to Nier's style and it adds a surprising amount of customizability in changing builds for material farming, speed running, leveling up fast, and a broad balanced build. Even the HUD serves as chips! You can also fuse chips to get optimal loadouts, and I really like the minmaxing meta here of chip fusing.\n\nThere are three playable characters. The variety is nice. The fact that they all play the same however is disappointing. It's especially puninishing when playing as 9S, who replaces Heavy Attack with Hack, which is far too situational.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Music is excellent. I love the orchestral soundtracks. And the remixes across the story of the same songs. The art style is decent but not surprisingly good or bad for 2017. There are many reused assets in the open world, making it feel bland at times. Colors, character design, and overall art is great though.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Amazed at the seamless integration of 2D bullet hell and 3D hack and slash in the prologue.\n+ The opera singer boss Simone. The boss is designed perfectly, and with a tragic history. And the stage is set well. It's the first time you see bullet hell in a boss fight. It's the first time you see the hacking section, which just blows your mind you get sucked into it in the middle of a boss fight.\n+ Rolling my eyes and sighing as I play through the first several hours of Route B. I didn't get to the new content after Flooded City until 9 hours into Route B. And the new portions are primarily hacking and flight sections, which are fun minigames but should not serve as primary.\n+ The walking simulator part where you can play as several different enemies in the Abandoned Factory in Route B. Route C asset-wise also has the same locations and enemies, clearly beating down on the repetition.\n+ Koshi and Roshi.Shocked at the seamlessness of the constant back-and-forth switching between 9S and A2. It ends as a sort-of-final boss well in combining both the normal gameplay and flight sections.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ You're incentivized to buy and upgrade all weapons to the maximum level 4, unlocking a secret sidequest.\n+ Multiplayer appears passively as corpses you can retrieve items or revive.\n+ There's only one major missable aspect in Nier Automata which is Ending Y (https://www.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/9cncw8/spoilerfree_faq_guide_for_nierautomata/).\n+ You're swimming in G by endgame. This removes the need for farming.\n+ Unlike most hack and slash games, Nier doesn't have any fighting combo moves which I find convoluted even in fighting games which the hack and slash genre borrowed it from.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Near-limitless inventory space.\n+ No autosave. You must manually quick save. I do like the mechanic of access points which act as a sort of GPS, deviating between Quick Save only and Save with Transport option.\n+ I think the meta of healing being overpowered in Nier is interesting. There are many healing chips and consumables are cheap.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Souls-like death penalty, but harsher in that you not only lose your experience but also your active chipset. Individual chips can take hours to farm, making the penalty extremely harsh to the point that the online recommendation is to reload the game. Note in flight sections, you don't lose anything though.\n+ All weapons of the same category have the same moveset. The minor differences between the many weapons inside a category is size of combo chain, stats, special abilities.\n+ Difficulty gap between Normal and Hard. Normal is apparently too easy, with one-shotting bosses and a handful of deaths over an entire playthrough. Hard on the other hand gets two-shotted on all mobs and is especially annoying because unlike Dark Souls, checkpoints are very sparse. I do like Hard encourages a very different playstyle than Normal, which is more deliberately paced in timing attacks rather than Normal difficulty's Devil May Cry and Bayonetta spam.\n+ It's not fully voiced.\n+ No native 21:9 support, stretching the screen when at fullscreen.

(If I decide to continue, Nier Gestalt, the NA/EU release which is English-translated although it features a different protagonist than the original Japanese version, will be next (https://www.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/9pbqke/spoilerfree_faq_story_guide_for_nier_2010/). It seems unlikely given how bad the writing plots are (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8xx4sT6rEI) although the guy is very likeable (https://www.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/5vfoyd/behind_the_scenes_of_that_amazing_nier_automata/).) Following discussion (https://www.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/9qvcwk/things_to_readplaywatch_before_nier_automata/, https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/7lnumi/nier_automata_do_i_need_to_play_the_original_nier/), the games are somewhat disconnected especially against the Drakengard series as NieR is a spinoff; and NieR apparently has slightly better story over NieR Automata which is the better overall game. Drakengard 1 apparently isn't even good, and Drakengard 2 is not directed by Yoko Taro (https://www.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/8m1727/is_drakengard_worth_it/). Therefore it's worth playing Nier first as I may as well do it in release order. It's also recommended to at least watch lore summary of previous games (https://youtu.be/JE6n2KGbaZ0). I was also inspired to play this from its general positive reception, 20 hour playtime according to howlongtobeat.com, and a recent personal marathon in March 2019 of action-style RPGs: Dark Souls series, Devil May Cry, Nioh, Bloodborne, Sekiro.\n\nI played on Normal difficulty for the first level and then Hard afterwards (https://www.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/5znspe/what_difficulty_should_i_play_this_on/, https://www.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/5wgjx8/no_spoilers_can_we_talk_about_the_difficulty/). I switched to Normal for Route C as I was underleveled (44) and felt the game was too unforgiving and not fun (oneshots, attacks hard to see in the chaos, certain scenes like the flight scenes or 9S getting hacked). I played on max settings but with antialiasing off as adding it and Ambient Occlusion introduces LOD popping (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=914437196). I played on controller as like many JRPGs, Nier wasn't designed with keyboard in mind (PC more broadly) (https://www.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/8e62mh/is_nier_automata_worth_it_on_pc/). I did not follow a guide (except for sidequests) and completed sidequests only after I got access points. I prioritized my early G for plug in chip capacity and then spent it wherever for new weapons and weapon upgrades. My preferred loadout stacks HP and Defense chips to avoid getting one-shot, then farming chips like XP and Drop Rate, and then offense chips like Critical Up. I stuck with Virtuous Contract and Treaty the entire game as I felt the weapons did not offer much variety in moveset or power in any case. I finished Route A in 18 hours, completing most sidequests, and Route C in 36 hours. I did not complete all endings, sidequests, weapon collections and upgrades, DLC colosseums, archive entries, or minmax my chipsets.",

    "comments": "As a brighter and streamlined, Ashen makes for a nice experience. What most stands out is its art style, optimism, open levels, and sound design. Unfortunately, the combat, enemy designs, and levels feel meaty but overall mediocre without any interesting innovations or Dark Souls' depth. I also found its most unique twist of a companion to be inconsistent, lending many battles to be too easy or too hard depending on how good the companion AI is at the time.\n\n__Story.__ Slightly ripped off of Dark Souls. But taken a bit more optimistically in that it's the rebuilding of a bleak world, which I like. Nothing specifically interesting, just standard Western fantasy lore.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Core souls-like mechanics of health and endurance; weak vs strong attacks; plunging attacks and sprint-attacks; bonfires and estus flasks; movesets for one-hand/shield/two-hand; death penalty; hub that grows over time. I find it most interesting what the differences are in Ashen's Souls-like mechanics. Most notable is the companion. Forgiving difficulty. No stats system, instead health/stamina upgrades from collectibles and story progression. Levels are typically more open and well-lit, which in turn makes fighting more open and exploration of all nooks and crannies a bit more difficult. I greatly preferred the more narrow areas in Ashen such as the dungeons and Pinion Pass. I especially love the lighting in Ashen, which I feel implements the Torch from Dark Souls II even better without the annoyances of finite fuel. You can replenish your Estus Flasks without resetting the zone. No convenant system or PvP invasions. There's a jump button, which largely feels unnecessary in the game. There's a map and compass. There is no parry, riposte, spells, build variety, per-weapon moveset, gear variety, repair so much less combat depth. Character has finite bag space and also cannot sell items for currency, only store them in the town storage box. Relics and Talismans.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ I love Ashen's optimistic view moving from bleakness, and how that's reflected in the art style: soft colors, clean UI, soothing music.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Dodging the charge attack from the Ghost Maiden things.\n+ Dying over and over again in Amiren Dungeon.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Unlike Dark Souls, you can't be blocked from completing a NPC quest if you complete the pathing incorrectly.\n+ Unlike Dark Souls, there is not any finite quantity item such as upgrade materials. For Sapient Moss/Roots/Twinroots, there are enough in the endgame that it's not a problem.\n+ No missables.\n+ Storage chest is auto-sorted.\n+ 21:9 works natively.\n+ Teleportation mechanic where you can throw a spear at the glowing monk statues.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Passive multiplayer system similar to Journey.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Many of the weapon movesets have the heavy attack actually be faster or do less damage than the weak attack. It makes no sense.\n+ Moveset variety across weapons is also bad.\n+ Item drops percolated across maps are often not good. There's not as much a sense of joy as in Dark Souls where you pick up an armor set.\n+ No hit collision, e.g., with walls.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ all gear; also explains best shield, etc. | https://www.reddit.com/r/AshenTheGame/comments/a5yb9c/ashen_gear_database_and_misc_info/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/AshenTheGame/comments/abhcnu/ashen_all_weapons_armor_shields_relics_feathers/\n+ best 2h weapon | https://www.reddit.com/r/AshenTheGame/comments/a4uxe7/best_2h_weapon_stun_vs_crit/, https://www.reddit.com/r/AshenTheGame/comments/a853p0/your_favorite_2handed_weapon/\n+ best 1h weapon | https://www.reddit.com/r/AshenTheGame/comments/abwkln/is_the_spiked_club_that_good/\n+ best armor | https://www.reddit.com/r/AshenTheGame/comments/ah0ofa/ashen_armour_rankings/eeawbc1/, https://www.reddit.com/r/AshenTheGame/comments/acuvcy/armor/\n+ robust talisman | https://www.reddit.com/r/AshenTheGame/comments/a4tuqi/best_talisman_in_the_game_so_far/\n+ farm area | https://www.reddit.com/r/AshenTheGame/comments/a7ilhm/best_spot_to_farm_scoria/\n\nMotivated to play this as I'm hungry for Souls-like combat, enemy, and level designs. This entry does not include the DLC Nightstorm Isle. I stuck to 2-Hander for max dps except in dungeon areas where I needed to swap to lantern+1H. I prioritized stamina on my talismans, relics, and armor. I rarely use potions or spears because they're consumables. For my 2H weapon, I settled on the Runic Axe. It has the second highest weak attack damage, where the highest (Gilded Halberd) has a strong attack that's weaker than its weak attack and its weak attack can only thrust. For my armor, I used Disciple Vestments until I could pick up Defiler Veil. I did not follow a walkthrough, so I didn't find all items including the White and Black Ashen feathers.

    "comments": "Like Conviction, Blacklist is an action-oriented take on Splinter Cell's iconic military stealth. Certain combat mechanics such as light levels and leaving after infiltrating most missions are removed. Certain action mechanics such as cover system and Mark and Execute are added. Level designs are stale as is enemy variety. It all leads to a polished action but heavily streamlined stealth game. Like all Splinter Cells, it has as bad story and characterization as usual.\n\n__Story.__ Don't care for it as always. Tom Clancy stories are B-rated drama. Military babble. Technobabble. Gore. The game combines it with cheesy voice acting and choreography.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Splinter Cell missions are a chain of linear paths, each with a microstealth area to solve. Core stealth mechanics of crouch, run, sprint; controllable movement speed; interactable lights; on-vs-off stealthed lighting; cover system; distract; lethal and nonlethal takedowns; enemy alert system; hiding bodies. Progression system via loadout and plane upgrades.\n\nI don't know what's up with all the action elements, with clear inspirations from Uncharted like the platforming, chase sections, and various one-off minigame mechanics. I actually enjoyed Grim and Korbin's side missions more than the campaign. They were more sandbox-y and involved the core of what makes the game fun: stealth, ghosting, and takedowns.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Well-detailed and a clearly polished AAA title for 2013. Face models are clearly most aged. It definitely looks on par (e.g., lighting and textures) with Last of Us, Tomb Raider, and Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag which are also 2013. Sound design is blaring and overly dramatic. Level designs are forgettable.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Checkpoint save system.\n+ Like Chaos Theory, you can control movement speed which subsequently controls footstep noise.\n+ You can shoot out lights.\n+ I like the mission scoring system with the three different playstyles of Ghost, Panther, and Assault, and that Ghost provides the most points with the specific approach of passing by enemies undetected providing the most.\n+ I like the progression system and loadouts, which offer more customizability than Chaos Theory's presets.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ I don't care for the action options that have been expanded upon ever since they were introduced in Conviction.\n+ Call of Duty-style health system.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ No light level like Chaos Theory. Just on/off.\n+ Hub between missions. It's just a waste of space and inefficient navigation.\n+ You can tag enemies which constantly provides you with their location. I never really liked this stealth mechanic ever since I first experienced it in MGSV and Far Cry 3. It makes games too easy and unrealistic, but it's not a gamebreaker like how much I despise a manual save system.\n+ Mark and Execute. Makes things too easy.\n+ Spy and Merc online feature which I don't care for. Same with the bloat of Ubisoft Uplay challenges. And Gone Dark missions.\n+ This guy climbs walls as stupidly fast and unrealistic as Uncharted.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/splinter-cell-blacklist\n\nLike most all stealth games, I played ghost (nonlethal no alerts) which is typically the most challenging and designed-to-be-fun in stealth games. I go lethal only when I must. I played Normal. I completed only the main campaign and the 4th Echelon side missions (except Briggs' which requires coop and Charlies' which is just action waves and is not why I play Splinter Cell).",

The story overall is not nearly as compelling. I do appreciate its ambition in more dynamic scenes at varying levels of formality, conversations vs in person, and locations. Gameplay-wise, it had a worse video scrubber and one-sided conversations that unfortunately ruined a lot of atmosphere as you spent much of your time just in fast forward reading subtitles and in silence. I liked the higher budget recordings in that it involved multiple actors and locations.\n\nOne technique I found helpful was to stop a clip at a given phrase to take notes, then note that specific phrase so I can loop back precisely at that video timestamp.

Flaw-wise, the game deviates too little and unfortunately feels very same-y. There are also 18 bonecharms in a single mission (and no way to track them). That makes exploration feel more like a tedious collectithon. This game feels much like Dishonored's version of Uncharted Lost Legacy: standalone expansion to an excellent finale; some minor improvements but otherwise lackluster in story and same-y feeling. As a third flaw, the game reuses parts of levels even more than Dishonored 1 did in the first two missions: Missions 2 and 3, Missions 4 which is a copy of Dishonored 2's Mission 5; the game should have just been 3 missions long of new content instead of stretching it out.\n\n__Story.__ Story feels like a nice sequel to Dishonored DLC's with Daud. Billie Lurk doesn't feel as compelling a character to play though. The story doesn't really grab one. There is also no chaos mechanic to add dynamism to the story.

The idea behind gameplay is intriguing: search and watching nonlinear clips at your own pace, building up a picture through threads of intrigue through an extremly fine control of inquiry as opposed to other mystery games often involving just a handful of choices via dialogue options. There's something strangely alluring about finding new videos and marking them as watched. You also pick up a lot of the story piecewise in a manner that's substantial: certain queries like \"tattoo\" lead to the most natural question you would ask and therefore reward you for feeling like a true detective; the script has specific themes which incentivize you to search for keywords like a person's name, occupation, \"twins\", \"pregnant\", \"throat\", \"attic\". The chronological ordering of results and top-5 limitation really adds depth by encouraging you search for more specific terms to find the later interviews.\n\nOn the plot itself, the story is unsettling and works well patch-wise. Many clips are just goosebump-wrenching. That clip where she sings a ballad on guitar for example. I'm impressed they could do an entire video game well purely on one-sided interview clips, all brimming with depth in metaphors, ambiguity and contradiction, and subtlety. The ambiguity of whether two twins or all a story with intentional fabrication for the case of split personality is so subtle and interesting. And that's so unsettling because it starts at the very beginning.

The shooting mechanics are fun but not innovative in any way, building on the camera and action-style of Resident Evil 4, even the pacing of picking off limbs to kill zombies each limb of which serves a purpose. This gets repetitive after 5-6 hours of its total of ~12 hour playthrough. Reading online, I'm less motivated to play the Dead Space sequels because it apparently is even more action than horror. The story and bestiary is also only serviceable.\n\n__Story.__ Story is serviceable: landing in an unknown ship, trying to understand what went wrong while you escape. Main character is a bland silent protagonist. Backstabs and insanity reveals are all predictable.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Purposefully sluggish controls and aim, making rushing enemies leave a stronger sense of thrill. Linear level designs. Ammo crates and items incentivize exploring every corner of a room. Third-person shooter very much follows Resident Evil 4 and does it well. Enemy variety is also great.\n\nI love how all the game HUDs are rendered in-game. You can even be attacked while upgrading in the Shop or Bench. There's no pausing to stop the horror. :-) And default HUD is minimal to none. Save points feel like Dark Souls bonfires in their sense of qualm every time you reach one. THe zero gravity and no-air mechanics also add variety to the levels.\n\nProgression is via a shop and accumulated credits as the currency, as well as an upgrade bench with the finite Power Orbs. I like that the shop and benches are scattered around the game. It still feels video gamey though.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The graphics technologically are impressive for 2008. Lighting and sound is great. The logs as the primary vechile to serve story works excellently with the seamless HUD to provide an immersive experience.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ The game keeps me feeling tense. And it's not even a difficult game! There are also generous save points and checkpoints. The most difficult part is the ammo conservation vs selling it off for the longer term investment via buying Power Nodes.\n+ Items have a highlighted hue to them. In-game it makes them easier to spot. Art direction-wise, it totally works.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ The breadcrumbs mechanic may be the best compromised way to get at quest markers that I've seen. I still don't like the mechanic though.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ The stomp move is very unpredictable, both in its extremely close range requirement and in not knowing which leg you'll be stomping with.\n+ Mouse lag is really bad.\n+ The map UI is horrid. The game is also linear enough that you don't need a map anyways.\n+ I ran into two game crashes (causing me to restart all over again from a save point), and multiple game blocks like guard rails still being closed when they should be open.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/dead-space\n+ https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/840-dead-space-mouse-fix/\n\nI played on PC (max settings) and Medium difficulty. I played with controller. After dabbling with the mouse and keyboard for a while, it felt very unnatural navigating the various keybindings all of which are natural on a controller (take the Rig Inventory navigation for example; or the Weapon reloading and modules). Following tips (https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadSpace/comments/18e373/just_fired_up_ds1_for_the_first_time_any/, https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/4217/what-should-i-focus-on-upgrading-first-in-dead-space), I focused on upgrading my Plasma Cutter (primarily damage then capacity) then some in the Stasis. I deliberately used only the Plasma Cutter, and up until ~Mission 8 when I had fully upgraded everything else, I decided to keep it that way instead of diversifying. Plasma Cutter works well for all mobs except for the mobs of little crawlers. I kept a minimum of 1 node on myself at all times for node-locked areas (https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/943338-dead-space/46246674?page=1).

    "date_started": "8/18/19",
    "date_finished": "8/22/19",
    "comments": "Dishonored 2 refines Dishonored 1's stealth with new powers and nonlethal attacks, enemy AI, improved combat mechanics, and with overall more versatile level designs. Some level even stand out in gaming history due to its dynamism: The Clockwork Mansion and A Crack in the Slab. Level-design wise, like its predecessor, Dishonored 2 balances well the fine line of linear story mission objectives and sandbox assassination. World-building through the lore scattered in the levels also remains excellent.\n\nFlaw-wise, Dishonored 2 has weak characters and story, even more paltry than Dishonored 1's. There's also not as much originality into the game, instead refining just a handful of elements like Emily as a nonplayable character, more nonlethal options to introduce a quadrant of choices rather than just a duo, and several more ambitious level designs. I don't like the new features of bonecharm crafting and masterwork blueprints which upgrade weapons. The two core flaws of Dishonored 1âsave system and dark visionâare no different in Dishonored 2.\n\n__Story.__ Story's recycled unfortunately. While slightly different, there's still a hub world of the Dreadful Whale. I like the various revists of characters like Anton Sokolov and marking the DLC villain Delilah as the main villain. New characters like Meagan are also good. However, like the past game, the overall plot is only servicable (https://www.reddit.com/r/dishonored/comments/6uhbty/probably_unpopular_opinion_i_think_dishonored_is/dltbese/). It's really the details though in the levels and notes in lore scattered around that add to it a more distinctive charm. For example, the motif of oil painters. And whale oil (even bonecharms emit a whale noise).The reveal of Meagan Foster as Billie Lurk: wow, I did not see that one coming!\n\n__Gameplay.__ Dishonored the series has one of the best gameplay mechanics Iâve experienced in gaming. And Dishonored 2 exemplifies it through its new nonlethal assault tactics. What I value most in gameplay mechanics are a minimal set of core tools which remain powerful in their flexibility and visceral in their usage. (To me, Dark Souls 1 is the pinnacle example of this: core tools of Sprint, Block, Parry, Dodge, Weak Attack, Strong Attack, and all with significant usage situationally.) Dishonored has extremely simple keybinds and with a core of Blink and crouching around followed by chokes. The versatility of all the powers in crowd control, navigation, and their adeptness across the the quadrant system of lethal vs nonlethal and stealth vs assault is excellent. Having a variant of Blink for each playable character, and with slight but meaningful differences, is a great way to add variety because it adds further depth to understanding what everyone takes as a fundamental tool.\n\nIt's cool that you can play as either Emily or Corvo. The nonlethal expansions are also expanded to be closer on par with the lethal ones: Combat Choke; nonlethal Drop Takedowns; Focused Strike followed by Choke when they're stunned or on the ground. Instead of a binary decision of lethal vs nonlethal, the decisions have a quadrant of lethal vs nonlethal on x-axis and stealth vs assault on y-axis (see the stats page).\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Love the mix of the oil aesthetic and high-resolution textures. Clockwork Mansion is an especially ambitious level. I like it although I did finding its navigation rather frustrating to find Bonecharms and Runes. Seems like it would be a lot easier to navigate if I used Dark Vision to see if I'm missing something below/above me.. And so is A Crack in the Slab which was not frustrating and such an interesting idea as an additional limitation from powers. I also like that the final mission Death to the Empress is a novel twist on the first mission's level as well as a level from Dishonored 1.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Dark Vision is nerfed. It's still in the game though. My main complaints about Detective Mode (especially pertaining to Dishonored) is that 1. it ruins the aesthetic and atmosphere; and 2. makes stealth too easy as you can see everyone through walls. I deliberately played without putting a point in Dark Vision.\n+ All of the options Dishonored 2 provides you for replayability: Mission+ mode lets you replay missions with all powers and equipment already available; custom difficulties which you can tune a huge collection of items; HUD options for better immersion.\n+ You can now Combat Choke. That makes nonlethal a bit more viable in the high chaos (although still not possible) regime where you get caught and must attack from frontal, nonstealth, melee. This is a more permanent utility over the Dishonored 1 DLC's stun mines and choke dust.\n+ Many doors are Breakable Doors.\n+ You can break into all the Black Market Shops (although you can't steal upgrades which I think is good).\n+ Guards seem more reactive. For example, opened doors. (I now close all doors when I go through them because of this: a small detail but an immersive one.) Seeing through windows that I opened.\n+ Choking is more viable. You can move forward and not just backwards while choking them. And you can stand or sprint when moving with them.\n+ There are two kinds of devices powering Walls of Lights: the regular control panel powered by a Whale Tank and windmill towers. This adds a nice amount of variety.\n+ A Crack in the Slab's time travel is such a unique idea not just for the level design but as a power for stealth.\n+ 21:9 support. FOV slider. Borderless.\n+ There's a Stats page so you can tell if you accidentally killed someone or got detected.\n+ Pretty fast loading times!\n+ By the end of the game, you can kill both Meagan and Anton before departing for the final mission. That's some fun animations. These details are similar (and much appreciated) in Dishonored 1 when you can kill pretty much all of the Loyalists once they serve their purpose.\n+ The Dreadful Wale isn't really like a video game-y hub like Dishonored 1's base was, where you have a shop for upgrading and purchasing ammo before the next mission. Instead, Emily upgrades by visiting black market shops which appear in most (but not all) missions.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Leaning to peek from corners is not as all powerful as the last game (https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/168516-dishonored-2/74568732).\n+ Corvo is now voice-acted and is almost retrofitted to be blood-related to Emily rather than just a father figure.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Powers are not balanced well. For Emily, Far Reach and Domino are too good. It prevents any usefulness for Shadow Walk (particularly if instead of spending the mana to go through, e.g., a rat hole you would want to explore anyways and end up arriving at that spot via another path), Mesmerized, and Doppleganger for stealth nonlethal.\n+ Bonecharm crafting and the additional finite collectible of Raw Whalebone. It sounds like a feature some business/HR person suggested because all of the modern games must have some crafting feature.. It does not suit Dishonored well. It sounds only useful for new game plus since Bonecharms don't carry over but their disenchanted version of traits do.\n+ For similar reasons, I don't like the weapon upgrades with Masterworks, and with a deliberate exclusive-or choice for each.\n+ The Outsider's voice actor is not as good. Not as calm and threatening. This one sounds too young.\n+ You can't hide the F to Skip button during cutscnees. It's distracting. Same as in Dishonored 1.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/dishonored-2\n\nI played on PC (max settings) and beat the game in 22 hours (as measured by Steam). I played as Emily on Medium difficulty. I chose Emily to add a fresh experience after playing Dishonored 1. Apparently the story also fits better for Emily where the antagonist for example is more personally connected to her. I played nonlethal. My arsenal (ordered by keybindings) is Far Reach (my Blink and grabbing isolated enemies to knock out from above), Heart, Domino (crowd control), Shadow Walk, Sleep Darts (ranged), Stun Mines (hairy situations), Pistol (Breakable Doors). Domino and Mesmerize serve similar purposes as crowd control, and I prefer the longer range of Domino. Shadow Walk has a really cool animations but it's nothing Far Reach and close-up grabs couldn't already do (or Domino for the multiple enemies). I use it situationally. Doppelganger sounds awesome particularly in high chaos because there are no fine control movements of the doppelganger. I didn't find it useful for low chaos.",

    "comments": "Far Cry 4 is basically Far Cry 3 (and unfortunately, I hear all the sequels since are like this too). The only major differences are the setting of Himalaya, improved graphics, and worse story and characters. Unfortunately, Far Cry's repetitiveness especially takes its toll in 4 where the novelty runs out and the experience is just more of the same bland open world. Aside from minor quality-of-life improvements, Far Cry 4 does add several new mechanics, but I think they actually worsen the game. In particular, Balance of Power mission paths are dumb: Far Cry works as a linear story, without this forced approach at replayability. I also don't like the Karma system, which forces participation in bland random encounters. And I could care less for all the extra sidequests like the Arena and upgradable house; there's just way too many to artifically pad content in the open world. \n\n__Story.__ Structurally and stylistically the same as Far Cry 3, which isn't necessarily bad. Pagan Min is an eccentric, fun villain but doesn't appear often, even less than the amount of times Vas appears in Far Cry 3. Story proceeds as an abducted American. The protagonist and his friends this time are even more bland. There is no Citra or Buck. It's the typical revolution story. Psychedelics.\n\nFirst-person view in seeing how the other characters act. Missions now have a Balance of Power choice which offers two different missions in the story. I think this is a bad design aimed for replayability.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The same as Far Cry 3 including combat, stealth, open world exploration and capturing radio towers and outposts, and the crafting and skills progression system. The controls are exactly the same. There are minor improvements, often quality-of-life based: you can now move bodies; the HUD has a sleaker style; loot from corpses now appear on the minimap; consumables like syringes are auto-crafted; autodrive given a waypoint and for manual drive, the path to a waypoint is highlighted; like Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, you can throw bait to lure predators towards enemies; throwing knives; outposts now have difficulties where each alarm must be deactivated separately. Some slightly more significant changes are the karma system with guns for hire; Fortresses which are larger-sized outposts; and the bumper aerial vehicle. The Shangri-la missions where you get to control a tiger companion is awesome.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Beautiful setting and most all cutscenes rendered in-engine. Some of the best graphics at the time. Shangri-la is especially amazing in its color palette. I like that the open world in Far Cry 4 is more vertical, requiring a grappling hook. It's a shame that all loot on minimaps are 2D, making it frustrating like in Far Cry 3 to find certain items.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Hunter enemies that don't appear permanently on your camera and which don't show alarm. They add variety, forcing you to not rely on crutches.\n+ The idea of Pagan Min being a pretty nice guy (at least to Ajay) and that you could have avoided the entire game conflict if you just stayed put.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ This game is more difficult than Far Cry 3. I struggled a lot more in encounters at the same normal difficulty. In retrospect, I should have played on easy since the game excels more in exploration and random hijinks. I turned it down to Easy in the last Act and remainder of the game.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ The Fly Suit is a neat idea. But it's binding with the hold-Jump action is extremely annoying. This makes certain precise jumps very hard to execute, particularly for certain poorly designed Bell Towers that ask for precise platforming even though this game does not offer precise platforming controls.\n+ Not only are there more many copies of the same boring side mission across outposts. But you also have to go to a certain location to activate them, e.g., the propaganda wars; the racing ones.\n+ I hate the karma system. It encourages playing random encounters none of which feel substantive. They're all redundant after the first time. And getting Karma Level 4 is a blocker to one of the most important skills: sprinting forever and moving faster when crouched.\n+ Stealth alerts are as bad as Far Cry 3 in immediately knowing your location. There's also no indicator of when you being in a darker location actually helps.\n+ Like Far Cry 3, traders all have the same inventory as your vending machine. So there's no point in using them.\n+ 21:9 support, but zoomed-in FOV without a slider which makes it bad. Note WGSF proposes you modify the setting in the text (http://www.wsgf.org/dr/far-cry-4/en), but that setting is just ignored (https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/2sennt/has_anyone_been_able_to_get_fov_changed_w_a_219/). Fortunately it doesn't have a zoomed-in HUD like Far Cry 3.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ jackfuste from WGSF's patch to add in the FOV slider for 21:9 (which is outdated) | http://www.wsgf.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=64&t=27713&start=160#p174830\n+ 21:9 review | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od5rta95UBY\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/far-cry-4/\n\nI played on PC (Ultra settings) and Normal difficulty. I beat the game in a total of 24 hours (according to Steam). I did not play the DLC. Like the last game, I prioritized stealth and crafting in my build. I use a silenced pistol, bow, assault rifle for when I inevitably get caught, and RPG for large vehicles and tanky enemies. I crafted early game to build up my equipment. For simplicity (and because I'm a realist), I always chose Amita's missions and then chose to spare Pagan. I did not complete the side quests like Longinus' or Shangri-la. I grew tired of the game.",

Favors are a nice mechanics addition, as well as powers to use assassin summons (which I never used). I loved how the core Blink move is more powerful with stopping time.

There is also no crafting, so there's no point in having animals around the map. For what's more of a linear game, it would improve by not having an open world map altogether. Stealth is also worse in this game it seems as there are fewer enemy cues and the environments all look so alike it's hard to go vertical or stealth around. I played this game Rambo style, and it seems like this game especially encourages it (e.g., all the confrontation scenes, and also the last few missions where you just destroy shit).

    "comments": "Dishonored defines first-person stealth like none other, and with powers in a steampunk setting. The core stealth mechanics are excellent, enemies and levels sufficiently varied, the aesthetic unique, and the story and characters are good enough to keep the rest of the game compelling. The only two major flaws are that the save system is really bad and the game puts an overliance on Dark Vision. I also do wish the game had a better usage of lighting and sound like Thief, e.g., a light indicator and more audible noises depending on the surface.\n\n__Story.__ Simple revenge and politics story. It's servicable to fit the gameplay. Establishing Corvo as an already seasoned veteran and legend is interesting. The backstab twist with the Alliance was really interseting. I did not expect it, and it significantly improves the story for adding just a bit more depth.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Love the core stealth mechanics of walking, running, crouching; lethal vs nonlethal; guard warn/alarm state; save system; gadgets and powers on the left-hand. Also light combat mechanics like parrying. With the first person view, new mechanics to the genre include leaning left/right. The powers are also inventive and add to the core stealth. Progression system is currency for weapon upgrades and runes for unlocking powers. Exploration is incentivized via coins, notes providing lore, blueprints which unlock more upgrades in Piero's workshop, and runes and bone charms which upgrade Corvo's powers. None of it is gamebreaking or hard to find, so you can be assured skipping the takedown of guards that you can stealth pass is a fine approach. I do wish the game had an indication of % camoflauge similar to MGS3 and Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory.\n\nChaos is a great approach to player adaptivity, changing the lore and difficulty depending on how lethal you are. It makes the lethal choice have an impact where otherwise games would provide a choice and only show consequences in your resultant score. The freedom to approach stealth is magnicient. For example, to go through a streetway, you can go through front streets, alleys, windows, rat tunnels, rooftops, and waterways.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The oil painting aesthetic is a great style and ages well, making any low-resolution textures feel like an artistic choice. I have no qualms with the graphics playing it in 2019. The detailed facial models and environments make it feel as if it were released this year. Steampunk setting is gorgeous. Cutscenes are all rendered ingame, and the horizontal black bars give it a nice film aesthetic.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Minimal HUD.\n+ 21:9 support.\n+ No map.\n+ No mission score, only statistics. Stealth is only necessary to go through the game, not increase an artifical rating according to some rubric.\n+ Dialogue options are navigable with WASD and F (the interaction button).\n+ The two major missable collectibles are Runes and Bone Charms which are not hard to find. You can use the heart to pinpoint their location. And ingame text signals when you're near one. Coins are also missable, as you cannot replay missions to get more of them. But there's enough across missions that you won't need to find them all to upgrade your arsenal. Blueprints, however, are missable, which is unfortunate as that forces you to use a walkthrough per mission so that you don't miss out on them.\n+ The calm, eerie demeanor of the Outsider's voice.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Subtitle font and style is on par with the oil painting art.\n+ Parts of levels are reused across missions.\n+ Bonecharms are random rather than fixed. This helps replayability.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ I dread the quick save system. I strongly prefer a well-designed checkpoint system in most all genres, stealth included, and Dishonored's autosave system is bad. Quick saves encourage players to savescum by design of being optimal, and savescumming ruins pacing and learning from any mistakes beyond microexecuted problems. Relying on autosaves forces you to become more skillful and cautious as the penalty is redoing a much longer checkpoint. Consider for example Far Cry's checkpoints which are right before you raid an outpost; or Tomb Raider's liberal checkpoints after major action sequences. At most, Dishonored should only enable the quick save option for new game plus, not for the first playthrough. More broadly, as Game Maker's Toolkit and Extra Credits say, players will remove fun out of a game if it's not part of the optimal path (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L8vAGGitr8, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSgVAoUm8s). This includes savescumming. Another notorious example are missable items in a JRPG: this encourages the reliance on a walkthrough where now the fun of a game is highly impacted by the quality of a walkthrough.\n+ Dark Vision (Detective Mode in Arkham series) is too good. It last for basically forever and it makes an obvious contrast for humans, their line of sight, and all interactable objects. and it's ugly, ruining the color aesthetic and sounds of the original game.\n+ Quest markers. Dishonored provides enough mission clues that it should be off by default. Fortunately there's a setting for this in the HUD, but it's weird that it's in the game.\n+ There are fewer nonlethal options than lethal. Lethal provides much more satisfying animations such as the drop-kill. Once you're in confrontation mode, nonlethal forces you to run away rather than confront (e.g., the DLCs offer Stun Mines and Chokedust; Dishonored 2 adds Combat Choke).\n+ Safes. Finding the combination can halt the game's pace in search for the mysterious 3 digit combo. I'd rather just look this up to remove the puzzle solving.\n+ I like that the game tells how many Runes and Bonecharms you've picked up and the total amount in a level. I wish this were part of a stats page in-game however. Otherwise you have to do the bookkeeping manually of remembering the amount you currently have and the total.\n+ There's no option to restart a level until you beat it. If you're going for Ghost (no detection) and realize you made a mistake much later when all your autosaves/manual saves went past it, you're stuck with the mistake.\n+ Alt tabbing doesn't really work. I have to use Windows Tab, and going back in-game takes ~5 seconds which is annoying.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ Gmanlives' review | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya4YtkyJK90\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/dishonored/\n\nI played the Definitive Edition on PC (max settings, keyboard and controller), which includes all the DLC (but which will be evaluated separately in a separate entry). According to Steam, it took me 17 hours to beat the base game. I played on Normal difficulty. I unbinded the quick save/load keys, relying only on autosaves and the occasional manual save if a particular autosave was too far away (Dishonored's autosave system is bad). I never reload a save and always play through mistakes until I die. My strategy is nonlethal and as a ghost which tends to be a game favorite direction in the hardcore stealth genre. It also adds to the challenge as takedowns take longer to execute, alarms wake them up, etc. I will only be lethal if nonlethal restricts my gameplay (e.g., fall attack) and when I'd rather play through my mistakes than start from a checkpoint all over again. Rune-wise, I did Blink -> Agility -> Bend Time -> Dark Vision -> Possession -> everything else.",

    "comments": "Far Cry 3 works well as an RPG-like open world with a \"stuck on a deserted island\" theme, decent story, and great core gameplay of combat, stealth, and exploration. The game's core flaw is repetition, quickly repeating the cycle of liberating outposts, going up radio towers, killing animals in some zone, and moving to the next waypoint for story missions and side quests. There is enough variety however in approaching combat, and in exploring/upgrading your arsenal, to keep it fun for most of the game. From research, Far Cry 3 is apparently the pinnacle of the series. Future titles attempt to emulate it with much of the same and no innovations of its own, only minor gameplay tweaks.\n\n__Story.__ I like the premise of a group of friends being raided by pirates, and the goal of the protagonist being to save his friends. The pirates vs natives set of characters is a little too cliche for my tastes however, greatly simplifying the dynamics of the open world island. So is the white savior fantasy. The infinite numbers of pirates and natives is dumb. Vas is a great psychopathic villain. His scenes are a lot of fun and clearly exhibit passion. Buck too. Willis, Dennis, and Sam are also not bad. I like the idea of disguising as the enemy in the last 1/4 or so of the game, and already giving you fast travel. It changes up the style a bit so it doesn't become \"explore yet another island\".\n\n__Gameplay.__ Gameplay consists of FPS firefights, stealth, exploration incentivized by improving your gear. Enemy variety consists of animals and humans which I greatly enjoy. The core gameplay gets repetitive halfway through the game, and I wished they reduced the ~15 hour playtime to 10 hours for a more packed game. Health bar and regeneration work well.\n\nThe FPS firefights is generic.\n\nStealth is very good. Consider for example my strategy to liberate an outpost. First, I scout the area, using my camera to pinpoint all the targets. I then either snipe the alarms or manually go in to deactivate them. Then I take out isolated targets at the periphery or higher elevation with my knife or from a distance with my bow (sometimes I throw a rock to distract and temporarily reposition enemies), hiding their bodies, and slowly inch towards targets in the center. If things go haywire, I take out my Assault Rifle with silencer. I never use Grenades, C4, or Mines.\n\nProgression system consists of skill points via XP, crafting via an inventory of hides, and money for purchasing weapons and ammo from stores.\n\nExploration is done pretty well. The crafting system incentivizes hunting and exploration in the open world. So does climbing radio towers for map access and liberating outposts for fast travel and removing enemy patrols. It's neat to also see enemies, allies, and animals alike engaging with each other. I could care less about the side quests, Relic and Loot Chest collectibles which pollute the map, and redundant Wanted Dead and Hunter quests which are just not good.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Facial models are surprisingly detailed for 2012. Environment graphics look standard for 2012. Environments are sufficiently varied with outposts/minitowns, jungles, water (including a ship level), and caves/tombs.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Fast travel. The ability to teleport to waypoints, and as long as you're not in combat, works very well for the pacing of this game.\n+ Money is abundance. And because the wallet has limited capacity, it encourages you to spend.\n+ Supernatural hallucinogenic story sequences.\n+ There is no requirement to play stealth. Rambo is fully viable. However, stealth gives 3x XP per kill (along with combos that have flash animations and even more XP). So the indirect incentive is nice.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Because of the vast open world, the minimap has to be obvious in where chests and plants lie. It's also explicit about enemy locations which I find awkward because it pushes too much of a reliance on the minimap than the first-person view.\n+ Vehicles. I think it's cool that there are multiple land and water vehicles to manuever with. I didn't use them often though as fast travel and walking in a straight line (rather than following a road and referencing a map about which turn to take) to be more convenient.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ The biggest stealth flaw is that when one enemy detects you, all enemies are alarmed in the area and somehow know where you are. This makes stealh unforgiving and unrealistic when detected.\n+ The HUD clutter, especially early game when there are tutorial HUDs, is bad.\n+ 21:9 support is atrocious. It's so bad that I stuck with the closest 16:9 aspect ratio (2560x1440p). It's native supported, but the screen is cropped, making the FOV zoomed-in and the HUD (e.g., minimap) way too large. Some pieces of the HUD even overlap such as the XP bar and minimap (4:00 at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hscjYs0Ibr8).\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/far-cry-3\n+ Gmanlives' review | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqMBvk_lwtE\n\nI played the original game on PC (max settings), keyboard and mouse, and normal (Survivor) difficulty. It's better in graphics than the Far Cry 3 Classic edition released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, which is a PC port on high settings (https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2018-far-cry-classic-is-a-barebones-pc-port). I did not play the DLC (see the Deluxe Edition). This entry does not include the standalone expansion Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, which if I play will be evaluated standalone.\n\nMy playstyle and build is stealth (https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/632849-far-cry-3/64988164). I went hunting for quite a bit in the early game to build up my gear, and continually did so as I played the main story getting effectively max crafted gear (excluding gated items from Path of the Hunter quests) by 1/3 of the way into the game. From there it was smooth sailing, main mission after main mission, stopping only to climb radio towers for minimap access and liberate outposts for fast travel. My main four weapons are Bow, Assault Rifle, Sniper Rifle, RPG.",

    "date_started": "8/9/19",
    "date_finished": "8/10/19",
    "comments": "Assassin's Creed II is apparently the pinnacle of the series alongside Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. But I found it to be deeply flawed, with a poor story, clunky combat and platforming, basic stealth with little freedom and variety, and with unnecessary RPG-like shop/equipment/town upgrading mechanics. On the plus, I do like Assassin's Creed historical setting and overall concept of assassination (excluding the modern scifi pieces). There are also certain moves and ideas from this game that have become staple in modern AAA titles like stealth kills from air, hiding spots, and ledges. For a game based on assassins, it's ironic that Assassin's Creed's claim to fame is not actually in its stealth; it's the open world and RPG mechanics (https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/92va26/an_assassins_creed_game_focused_on_stealth/).\n\nEverything else, however, I found fault. Most problematic is the clunky platforming and stealth. I couldn't excuse these even when other games in 2009 had better versions. Tomb Raider in 1996 has better climbing and scaling. MGS4, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, and 2009 titles like Uncharted 2 and Arkham Asylum have better stealth. Oblivion has a better open world and missions. In this game, I would often try to scale a platform only to fall down and have to redo a sequence again; or try to sneak up to an enemy but completely fail because there's no crouch mechanic, hiding behind walls, or light/percentage-based camoflauge. Missions are simple and lack variety: kill this guy in this one location, move around in the town escaping guards, fetch this, follow this escort, track this person. Both the story and RPG mechanics are mediocre.\n\n__Story.__ Story is stale---like the quality of a mediocre Netflix title. If this is the best of the series, then color me unimpressed. I like the overall premise of starting from a rambunctious young man and seeing over the course of an entire trilogy how he evolves. But the story itself is not well-executed, filled with tropes in the narrative and 1-dimensional characters and villains. My opinion is and has always been that Assassin's Creed would be a better game without the modern scifi story on top of it. It's completely unnecessary. Also, having Leonardo da Vinci as a character? Please. For an Assassin's guild, there is no other assassin or notion of membership and ranking that would have been interesting to push on. Ezio is touted as handsome, woman-conniving, and as you move, and the story involves characters constantly praising his powers, particularly the villains. Given the self-insertion, it's pathetic.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Gameplay comprises combat, stealth, platforming.\n\nCombat and platforming are mediocre. The animations, hitboxes, and pacing feels clunky as an old game. I do like the concept of the 4 buttons varying as left hand, right hand, head (so talking/interacting), and legs (so fast walk/run). Side step and the ability to just spam parry. I also hate Eagle Vision (detective mode in Arkham) in any game. Weapon selection tool, and pausing the game to change weapons, is bad. Combat is almost too easy in that you can destroy an arbitray mob of soldiers, which incentivizes Rambo mode more often than being purely stealth.\n\nAssassin's Creed is a bad stealth game (https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/a4hi8o/stealth_in_older_assassins_creed_games_was_not/). The concept is interesting in that instead of the traditional stealth game where missions typically involve sneaking around enemies, you instead move around blending in crowds, sitting on a bench, hiding in tents, etc. in plain sight (Hitman-style). However, missions often do involve sneaking around (and anytime you're on rooftops). But you can't sneak so the game fails hard at it. Missions are also highly scripted without much freedom. The stealth elements are interesting however: for example, blending as crowds walk or stand around, sitting on benches, stealing as you bump into people, hidden blade, notoriety, stealth kills from air (was Assassin's Creed the one to popularize this move as well as the automatic freerunning?), stealth kills from hiding spots/ledges, hiring goons. I only wish there was real sneaking, which is a core flaw in the mechanic.\n\nThere's also a town renovation mechanic where you build up your shops and also provide the town more value which raises your regular income. I find this side gameplay completely unecessary. There's also horse and boat riding neither of which are particularly good. I would rather they refine the core combat, stealth mechanics, missions, and level design. There are also armor to upgrade, armor to repair, weapons to purchase, larger medicine pouches, and health consumables. Collectibles include treasure chests (which just add more money), glyphs (the main collectible), feathers, and codices (which upgrade your max health).\n\nI'm not a fan of \"open zone\" open worlds, including Assassin Creed II's. That said, the design is impressive for 2009, even larger scale than Arkham City which came out 2 years later. The cities all feel very same-y though, making the game feel large only for the sake of being large. I hate this aspect of open worlds, and this is true only more so in modern games, including all Assassin's Creed future iterations.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Hard to appreciate its graphics as I feel its age playing it in 2019. I don't like the \"science\" style for its HUD/interfaces. It adds a lot of bloat to the aesthetic and looks stupid (speaking as a scientist myself).\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ The ending is gated by collecting things.\n+ You can't skip cinematics. This makes replaying something whenever you fail tedious.\n+ PC version: Controller support is bad. The mappings in the tutorial and interfaces also don't correspond to your controller mappings so the learning curve of the button layout is steep. No windowed or borderless window mode. Fortunately Steam's Shift-Tab followed by alt-tabbing works although loading takes much longer.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaming4Gamers/comments/b9fl9e/what_is_the_best_assassin_creed_game_to_start_on/\n\nI chose this version as my first Assassin's Creed game. It seemed regarded to be generally the best, along with Brotherhood (the third) and 4 (https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/27/16554856/assassins-creed-origins-games-ranked). Choosing this lets me read the Wikipedia summary to understand the first, and follow along with the next sequels if I like the series.\n\nI used English audio with English subtitles. I would love to play in Italian audio, but it seems like the game was developed natively with English. I played on PS4 according to the Ezio Collection, which remasters the game with textures, lighting, and only is worse than PC in having 30 FPS instead of 60 FPS and no 21:9 support (https://n4g.com/news/1958857/assassins-creed-2-the-ezio-collection-vs-pc-original-graphics-comparison, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JNJ1rSreV0). I originally tried playing on PC with Xbox One Controller on February 2019. It has issues. Manual remapping of button works fine (following these settings https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_II/Controls), but the game does not recognize the Left/Right Triggers (so Contextual Camera / Weapon Selection; I mapped them to L3 / R3 instead; R3 has no use; L3 is previously First Person View which is useless). The x360ce mentioned online did not help (https://steamcommunity.com/app/15100/discussions/0/34095684753143672/). Resolution-wise, I'm pleasantly surprised PC supports the 21:9 aspect ratio for gameplay, even if it doesn't for cutscenes. I did not play the two Sequence DLCs. I did not complete Sequence 14 (the ending) either. It requires collecting all Codex pages, which is not content I'm willing to endure, and which gives one last mission: kill the pope. I decided to watch the ending instead.",

In SMB's case that example would be quick, responsive platformer movement, and levels designed around it. The rest of the game is completely stripped out. The point of the game is to get to the end of the level quickly and without dying. There are no powerups. There are no checkpoints. There is effectively no story.

    "comments": "I enjoyed Shadow of Mordor's open world, combat, and stealth mechanics, greatly preferring its gameplay mechanics over action-adventures that heavily inspired it like Arkham and Assassin's Creed. At its core is viscerally satisfying gameplay. There's nothing other games hold to it in the feeling of being overwhelmed by a large collection of foes yet slashing through them. Most impressive is the Nemesis system as a personalized progression system against an army. It can be a lot of fun going through the map, killing Orc Captains, and leveling/gearing up.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is a sandbox and falls into common traps of open-world games. For one, level design is redundant with little variety. For two, it fails to have any sense of a connecting story and side quests. For three, the only incentives for exploration outside the Nemesis system are boring Artifact collectibles and loot for Mirian currency. I think only RPGs have been successful at open world games. Action-adventures that are more \"open zones\" than open world provide too little content, diluting the density of content per travel time. I think action-adventures can succeed in freedom via metroidvania-style open worlds in the likes of games like Tomb Raider and God of War, where regions unlock according to a linear storytelling and each is big enough to incenvitze explroation (although I dislike the mandatory backtracking from locked abilities to revisit older areas). Other qualities are servicable but not necessarily impressive either: level design, progression system, aesthetics, sound, any inventions in the gameplay.\n\n__Story.__ It's borderline bad. It's a skeleton story with scuffed Aragorn alongside cameos such as Gollum. Story points are disjointed. Most of the \"story\" emphasis is instead placed on the Nemesis system where it's like a choose your own adventure in personalized progression of killing captains and ranking up new ones.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Shadow of Mordor plays similar to Arkham and Assassin's Creed with a single-button melee combo, counter, ground finisher, stealth kills. Gadgets are replaced with a bow and arrow and magic, where ranged is actually viable for kills rather than just stuns. Additional mechanics like interrogating Worms for intel; possibility to recover from death state; Drain, particularly with the Brand ability for mind control. XP for an ability progression system. Level design is also semi-open. Standard amount of enemy types; I do like that unlike Arkham, the game's enemies also involve animals (although I think they could do more here).\n\nMost new is the Nemesis system and Mirian currency as a progression for attributes (weapon slots, Health, Focus, and Elf-Shot). The Nemesis system personalizes the ranking of generals in Sauron's army to your gameplay. Reward for defeating them besides lore is lots of XP and Power to unlock ability tiers. Mirian currency is found through collectibles and side missions.\n\nUnlike Arkham series, stealth is a lot more forgiving. For example, alert doesn't automatically signal all enemies. They have to raise an alarm. As another example, you can run straight in front of an enemy and stealth kill them for about a second before they raise their weapon. Because battles happen in the open instead of indoors, it's also easier to select where you fight and when/how to retreat.\n\nUnfortunately, the sandbox fun with Nemesis doesn't last long.The main quest can often be dumb \"asssassinate this guy\", fetch quests, or follow the leader quests, which offers little diversity to the game.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ What you'd expect for a generic AAA title in a fantasy setting. Setting and music are forgettable.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Universal difficulty.\n+ Unlike Arkham series, the equivalent of Detective Mode is not useful outside forensic/environment investigation. In combat, it only lets you see living souls which you can already see on the minimap. And the foreground is black which makes navigating let alone fighting in the mode impractical.\n+ Unlike Arkham City, you can interrupt the animation of your ground finisher. This makes it a much more viable move.\n+ Unlike Arkham City, the minimap is an actual minimap, not a compass. Waypoint also appears explicitly on the main screen and with a meters number.\n+ You can advance time.\n+ 21:9 support.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Reliance on QTE for certian battle scenes and always for the death state.\n+ Fast travel.\n+ Tomb Raider-esque artifact collectibles. Complete with the examination and audio narration.\n+ No death penalty. Your nemesis just ranks up.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Weapon slots are only stat boosters. They have no effect showing that they actually do anything, e.g., modifiers in action RPGs that add chance of spell casts and other cosmetic effects.\n+ The superpower cooldown is OP. You can turn it on and just brutalize a group of captains.\n+ Final two missions (boss fights) are super anticlimactic. The Braided allies only help in a single isolated piece which is killing a group of other Captains. The bosses themselves are QTE.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor\n\nI was motivated to play this after playing the Batman Arkham series where combat is apparently similar but within a medieval setting (so like Dark Souls in arsenal). Also motivated after watching the video article about a Batman title eventually becoming Shadow of Mordor (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0lRkQd9skU).\n\nI played on PC with a controller (max settings; the official benchmark ran at ~100 FPS). I did experience a sound issue where dialogue volume is too low  while cinematic sound was way too high (https://steamcommunity.com/app/241930/discussions/0/613940477865130491/). It seems like setting to Headphones caused this; the default environment setting seems to be fine. There are three major DLCs: Lord of the Hunt (separate map), Trials of War (challenge maps), Bright Lord (play as elf character in separate zone). I played none as they weren't recommended (https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/4y5lxv/beat_shadow_of_mordor_any_dlc_worth_checking_out/).",

    "comments": "Batman: Arkham City is a polished Arkham Asylum. Core mechanics are improved such as stealth, beat-em-up melee combat, and gadgetry. Boss fights remain just as inventive. Most significant is the larger open world, sprawling as a city with more interaction in verticality and tools (for example, the grapple reaches significantly longer along additional options like Grapple Boost).\n\nDetective mode is still the major flaw. In addition, I don't really like (but don't necessarily hate) Arkham City's open world as the entire map is relatively homogenous, with little diversity just like in Arkham Asylum. Asylum was better in keeping the map much smaller; the trend of open world in this game and future titles ruins pacing in my opinion. Story is also slightly worse than Arkham Asylum, lacking its uniqueness in having many supervillains cameo and with their own boss fight and more.\n\n__Story.__ Features an arsenal of new awesome villains from the Batman series. Also includes heroes Catwoman and Nightwing both of whom are playable characters. Like Arkham Asylum, all the villains' weight in story mostly comes from prescedence. They each could be devoted their own game and this game like Arkham Asylum only cursorily features them all.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Core mechanics are the same as Arkham Asylum. Combat is slightly improved such as the flurry attack that feels really good to use when stunning an enemy with body armor. Most new is the open world with new gameplay elements to make traversal and exploration feel alive: for example, grapple mechanics are simpler to operate and automatically hurdle you over a gap if you grapple to one; and you automatically listen to radio conversations when in area to make it feel more alive. There also many side missions, but unfortunately some feel like fetch quests as busywork to make the open world feel alive (e.g., running around for Zzazz's phone calls). I found the additional mechanics for specific enemies to be a bit gimmicky, pushing further on Asylum's with specific movesets (e.g., OXX for riot shield enemies; XXSquare for Stun Stick enemies; SquareX for body armor enemies).\n\nI really enjoyed playing as Catwoman and Robin in order to have a little more variety in their advantages in movesets. For example, Catwoman is acrobatic, executing and moving around much faster than Batman. This makes her a joy to kill a bunch of mobs by circling around them instead of having to wait for Counters. It's kind of unfortunate how little Robin's gameplay appears in the DLC.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Movement feels much faster paced in this game. The animations are not as sluggish as in Arkham Asylum.\n+ Detective mode is not as mandatory in this game, and you're sometimes incenvitized to not have it on as, e.g., mission maps will not appear in the Detective Mode HUD.\n+ There's now a compass direction! Much desired from Arkham Asylum.\n+ You get clay on your costume during the Clayface fight.\n+ There are deaths in this game.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ I prefer the audio tapes in Asylum. Added a lot of lore and character.\n+ Solomon Grundy is not a fun boss.

Surprisingly, I did not need a guide to go through the house and pick up everything. The pacing of it is pretty good. I like how the story adds depth into the sister going through a phase, the mother and her successful career and a possible affair with the rwnger Rick, and the bumbling writer father who found recent success again.\n\nGood summary: https://steamcommunity.com/app/232430/discussions/2/666825524823216257/\n\nI played it on iOS.",

    "comments": "I like the rewind mechanic and how seamless it is for control. It works especially well in interactive narrative games like this so that you can experience all sides of content by just rewinding to hear the other choice, then making an action after hearing both consequences. I also like that it allows you to add new content, where you learn an answer after a conversation, then rewind the conversation to start a new topic given that information. And the cues to tell when choices actually matter, and when there's new content if you rewind. The rest of the gameplay is typical as a walking simulator with light puzzles. Animation, settings, and soundtrack work well. I also liked the sacrifice Chloe vs Arcadia Bay ending choice, even if it made no sense within the plot.\n\nThe characters are all tropes and a complete bore. The plot is sopping with teenage drama, none interestingly told in any way when compared to actually good teenage media like Catcher in the Rye, Freaks and Geeks, etc. These media all made innovations. Privileged rich kids. Jocks and bullies. Clique of cheerleaders and female bullies. Nerds and outcasts. Useless grown up authorities. Bland Catcher in the Rye references. I do like that the game offers some perspective to each of the characters to act out, and to provide Max with options to better understand and respond to this. However, it still remains fairly lacking in depth---going little beyond, for example, insecurity being Victoria's reason for bullying; and pressure being Nathan's excuse for being an asshole. Choices lead to bipolar personalities in all the characters, where they go immediately from enemies to friends from a single dialogue option.\n\nPlot meanders often: from teenage drama to larger school conspiracy to Chloe specifically to serial killer. It's overly dramatic with the rich kid owning the entire town; kids attempting suicide; drug dealers being involved; obviously ass-kissing and useless principal; serial killer; everyone smoking marijuana; town-scale eco disaster. I swear the game would have easily gone to actual murder or rape if it didn't try to remain pandering to tweens.\n\nThe cringy dialogue is fine. However, the teenager language uses so much slang that it feels forced at times. You can tell it's dialogue that 20-30 year olds think teenagers would say. You can tell who likes this game because they're probably cringey and like the label of being called a 'hipster'.\n\nPlot holes galore. The time travel is sort of a gimmick as a player mechanic and emotional drama tool. But does not lead to logial stories. For example, why Max couldn't go back in time to save both William and Chloe by using a different photograph? And her nosebleeds coming at convenient times only to avoid her cheesing her way through certain plot circumstances. But not being a problem when she travels 5 years in the past multiple times.\n\nI played on my Macbook Pro with a touchpad/keyboard, 1400x900 resolution, low settings. Ideally, it would be at max settings, highest resolution, and with a controller.",

With that said, there is also no pausing or rewinding, so you can miss a scene if you were distracted externally from the game.\n\nLove all the major choices and death reveals. Indidnât expect the first two of Faith and Snow White. They were the closest ones I connected to!\n\nStory slowly unravels to be about politics and the town as a whole with corruption. I find this scale to be too ambitious. Dicrimination between social classes is hackneyed. Like Heavy Rain,the plot ties you in with an intriguing premise of a serial killer. I think for the plot to remain interesting, it should fish further in that direction.\n\nI love the Manhattan setting, specifically Upper West Side for Fabletown and what I presume is Washington Heights for the Farmland. Iâm just a big fan pf the area overall as it adds a lot of culture to the game already swathing in fable history. The term Mundies for humans reminds me of the Muggle relationship in Harry Potter.\n\nGrungy colors and cell shaded aesthetics fit the fantasy noir well. I like how the recaps at beginning and end of every episode involves your choices. Makes it feel more personalized.\n\nI played the first playthrough blind. I then went back and read a walkthrough about the branching choices and their effects.\n\nI chose this for my first title by Telltale Games. The Walking Dead is the most popular but I already watched a good amount of seasons of the show and am bored by the story. This entry I'm writing about here spans all 5 episodes.\n\nNote there is no walkthrough for the game to understand the effect of different choices. Apparently, your choices don't really matter outside the scope of the existing cutscene most of the time in Telltale Games (e.g., there are no accumulating stats; \"X character will remember that\" and so on happens, but according to existing halfway complete walkthroughs and the overall trend of Telltale games, it's not clear they have any consequence; it's only a narrative stylistic emphasis).",

The bush crackling as you go to Bushwood Creek gave me goosebumps the entire time I was navigating. It's a good length. Walking became rather fetch-quest-y the last hour or two. Somewhat anticlimactic ending.\n\nGame proceeds linearly and with mostly linear paths. The map gives the illusion that there are more paths to reach a destination and explore than there actually are. And I think that's an excellent design choice for a linear story. Supply caches and new items keeps the mechanics and exploration fresh.\n\nLove the aesthetic of soft colors and Colorado wilderness.\n\nI played it on MacOS. I played it blind on a flight.

    "comments": " Heavy Rain is like any other David Cage game: a flawed, experimental narrative appealing to film trope fantasies while incoherent as an overall plot. Controls are clunky but offer interesting ideas. Individual chapters/scenes are interesting but holistically riddled with plot holes and poor characterization. The QTE-style of video gaming is an interesting genre and interactive novels like Heavy Rain push it further on this axis. Camera is really bad.\n\n__Story.__ Individual scenes can be good. But the overall story is riddled with plot holes. I like the multiple perspectives. Keeps the story intriguing although the plot and its development is weak. Father who lost two sons. Capable FBI detective. Excop private detective. Sexy 20-30 year old independent woman. (Madison's motivation makes no sense however.) I especially like how fatal choices to each of the main characters actually cause them to die. It's the mystery and darkness (not overly edgy) that keeps the story interesting if not the B-rated side characters. I like how dark and visceral the trials are. \n\nFlaw-wise, the story is riddled with major plot holes and undeveloped character cliches. Individual characters are fairly stock and overdramatic. For example, Liutenant Blake always being an aggressive punch-out against witnesses. Alzheimer condition for the serial killer's mother.\n\nPlot holes:\n\n+ The private detective Scott Shelby exonerates himsefl from being the Origami Killer during his thoughts (e.g., killing Manfred but in the chapter he narrates his thoughts, \"I wonder what's taking Manfred so long...\"; also storming the building to get the mafia boss).\n+ Ethan's blackouts (the true answer for them is that Quantic Dreams originally developed Ethan to be psychically linked to the killer which they ended up scrapping; so now it's a red herring that he has these blackouts and wakes up with origami).\n+ The tape recordings of Shaun alive after each trial somehow being convincing as they're not live (the tape recording in the gun handle is particularly notorious).\n+ What it takes to kill a child.\n+ The Triptocaine subplot seemed cool but never explained, only giving the possibility that he's the killer.\n+ Madison is somehow surprised at hearing Scott Shelby's last name during the reveal even though she never met him. And she knows his address!\n+ Madison somehow knows both Ethan's phone number and Jayden's phone number, the latter of whom she has never even met.\n+ Poison that's supposed to activate at exactly an hour.\n+ The fridge approach to escape a fire.\n+ Cops that are shoot-on-sight at the last chapter.\n+ Game (Jayden) profiles the killer as 30-45. Shelby is revealed to be 48. He does not even look close to that age, and his twin brother's grave marks being born in 1967 which does not translate to 48 in 2011.\n\n__Gameplay.__ I like getting to hear the character's thoughts. And also that options are integrated next to the character rather than a flat HUD. I find completing all the menial click/movement-based actions to do things around the places to be quite soothing.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Face models and lack of expressions remind me of Oblivion. I like the symphony music although it gets repetitive quickly. Camera angles are really bad. It's particularly jarring when you're moving, then the moving scene transitions and your previous direction moves you in the opposite direction in the new screen. The game would do much better without fixed angles.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Arbitrary resolution, borderless, and 60 FPS on the remastered PC verrsion.\n+ Game doesn't pause when you alt tab out. I do this frequently to take notes on the game.\n+ Graphics settings show examples of change as you upgrade/downgrade various features.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Many of your choices don't actually matter. But I like that the game gives the illusion that there are many choices in the game to make it feel more aunthetic. It's the not knowing aspect that keeps certain scenes in high suspense (e.g., if crawling over glass shards will really kill Ethan, or if the cops will really barge in on Madison and Ethan).\n+ The weird scifi invention of Ari sunglasses. Because they're sunglasses, they shouldn't have any audio..\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ No ultrawidescreen (21:9 specifically) support. There is a community patch but it has some stretching.\n+ Playing through the game in 2019, I had an inching that Scott Shelby was the killer as I had spoiled myself watching the ending many years ago. But as I played the game, I became skeptical of my memory as certain scenes would recall Scott's thoughts, and I would think \"There's no way that's what the killer would think.\" such as in the Manfred scene. And yet it turns out it is him..\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2018/05/23/eight-heavy-rain-plotholes-i-still-think-about-eight-years-later\n+ weird monologues that Shelby has even though he's the killer | https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/ae505z/heavy_rain_is_a_good_game/edo8ums/\n\nI played this on PC which provides upgraded resolution settings and with the highest difficulty. I decided to play this as the most popular and successful David Cage/Quantic Dreams game. I'm not interested in other David Cage/Quantic Dreams games aside from hype as other people have played it.

    "comments": "Batman: Arkham Asylum is an action-adventure in similar spirit to superhero titles like Spider-Man (2000). It features a combination of decent gameplay ideas: stealth, beat-em-up melee combat, gadgetry, and exploration in semi-open worlds---a combination inspiring many future video games. Most of these gameplay features are particularly great (with the exception of its simple yet fun beat-em-up moveset). Rather, it's the combination that keeps the game fun. In addition, the Batman theme and the story against iconic Batman villains grounds the game's design choices. And the boss fights are all excellent.\n\nThere is only one major flaw: detective mode. This significantly hampered my experience, ruining atmosphere and appreciating the aesthetics of the game. Other flaws are more minor such as having only decent stealth mechanics and exploration within a limited setting. I found stealth lacking and plain frustrating at times.\n\n__Story.__ Simple story (get people out of Arkham Asylum and back in control; thwart whatever Joker is up to). But it works well given the colorful characters and the setting. Voice actors are top notch, e.g., Batman, Mark Hamill as Joker.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Gameplay comprises combat with stealth and gadget and melee confrontations, and exploration in semi-open world and semi-linear environments.\n\nCombat is a beat-em-up with stealth elements and ranged attacks via Batman's gadgets. There are one-button melee combos, one-button counters, one-button dodges, combo moves/finishers, Cape Stuns that's fairly standard. Gadgets are ranged attacks and offer some pretty cool choices in tackling enemies and appealing to the Batman fantasy. The gadgets used for both exploration and stealth/combat are all excellent, e.g., the code sequencer for hacking; explosive gel; batarang for eliminating/stunning ranged enemies. Stealth is decent: grappling to higher ground allows for repositioning and there's a few options to take down enemies. Nothing fancy. Stealth can be extremely frustrating on certain areas however as guards (particularly with guns) can cluster when they find one dead body (you can't hide dead bodies). And Joker signals to them when you're in an area and a guard's suicide collar rings when one is out.\n\nExploration is incentivized by Riddler challenges and the semi-open world. Gameplay also includes Forensic Analysis and Environment Analysis. And gliding. Like Mario/Zelda, jumping and climbing walls is done automatically as you move toward them. Interestingly, crouch is manual though which is more for stealth controls than platforming. Progression system is simple (just a set of skill points and an unordered array of available skills) and works.\n\nBoss designs are excellent. The appeal of the Arkham setting is that each boss gets to feature a main villain within the Batman series as well as subvillains for minibosses and cameos. And they all have pretty good boss fights. E.g., the platforming and hiding in Scarecrow's, which is a good chance of pace away from the beat-em-up action. Croc's ambush and hiding around to collect spores. Enemy variety (i.e. not bosses) is okay but nothing special. They're all forgettable beat-em-up mobs.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The grungey blacks fit the game well. The setting is mostly forgettable however. This is particularly exacurbated given that Detective Mode is on 90% of the time.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Collectibles which fit into the lore via Riddler's challenges. I didn't go into collecting them all, but the option is nice. I don't know about collectibles literally just for the trophy achievements on PSN/Steam. There's no in-game benefit except for unlocking extras such as profiles. One advantage of not trying to collect them all in a playthrough is that I don't have to follow a walkthrough. I also don't have to leave Detective Mode on all the time (https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/989bf1/batman_arkham_asylum_so_are_you_expected_to_just/).\n+ Audio tapes. It adds character to all the villains. And it continues playing after you leave the menu! (Similar to MGS5 but not as ridiculously lengthy.)\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Health bar.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Arkham Asylum popularized detective mode/vision in video games. I don't like it. It promotes lazy level design and environment art where you spend your time in a completely different aesthetic from the original art, following highlighted item after highlighted item. The implementation in Arkham Asylum is especially problematic because there's no incentive to ever turn it off. It helps for exploration to find Riddler challenges; for combat in sensing enemy location and which have weapons; and general movement to find the next path via the interactable objects.\n+ A game like Arkham would improve from a minimap HUD. It's not Dark Souls where you effectively memorize the entire layout because you painstakingly spend time in each area because of its difficulty. See, e.g., Marvel's Spider-Man (2018) for a minimap HUD in a similar game. I hate being lost, taking a step in a direction, and pressing pause to look at the map yet again.\n+ Riddler challenge maps are impossible to use because they don't deactivate icons if you already got the riddle.\n+ X button is for Sprint. This is awkward to hold down while moving the camera with the right analog stick.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/batman-arkham-asylum\n\nI played the remastered version, Batman: Return to Arkham (2016) on PlayStation 4.

    "date_finished": "7/27/19",
    "comments": "Shadow of the Tomb Raider is the same game as Tomb Raider (2013) and Rise. There are only two major differences: a larger emphasis on exploration and puzzles than action, which appeals better to the strengths of Tomb Raider; and a more urban and jungle setting, involving more NPC interaction in villages.\n\nFlaw-wise, what I find most unfortunate is that Eidos Montreal and Crystal Dynamic are unwilling to take risks, doing so very little to improve upon Tomb Raider (2013). Rise and Shadow effectively play like expansions of the original game rather than as sequels, using the same plot (down to individual sequences) with a reskin of the environment, and almost entirely the same gameplay mechanics. Shadow makes so few changes to Rise's success in particular, and I actually don't like these changes such as the addition of hub towns/cities, more NPC dialogue, and merchants with a currency system. The Tomb Raider reboot's redundancy is perhaps most dramatic in Shadow: 1. the emphasis on exploration and non-combat, where redundancy in the environment designs and gameplay can really start to take its toll level after level; 2. a heavier reliance on the story, which was never good in the game (in fact, Shadow's is the worst of the trilogy); and 3. as the final game where redundancy really takes its toll. I greatly prefer Rise for these reasons: 1. it had a greater balance of exploration and combat to make gameplay more diverse; 2. there are changes to the previous game that I actually liked; and 3. it is a sequel, which made the direct copy not as bad as Shadow doing it a third time (fool me once..).\n\n__Story.__ Bad story and characters as always. Overly dramatic. Even the in medias res beginning and getting stuck in the wilderness is the same premise as Tomb Raider (2013) and Rise. To make this the worst story of the trilogy, the plot is now also incoherent, jumbling together multiple plot lines each of which are already weak (e.g., Trinity, Paihiti, the creatures, Lara's vengeance, Captain Rourke as a villain introduced 2/3 into the plot).\n\n__Gameplay.__ Gameplay is the same as Tomb Raider (2013) and Rise with minor revisions, at its core comprised of platforming, puzzles/exploration, and combat. Most noticeable is that there are fewer combat and enemy encounters than Rise, focusing further on exploration and puzzles.\n\nOn platforming, new features are: rappeling; wall run; overhead climbing.\n\nOn puzzles/exploration, most significant is the NPC interaction, building on Rise's idea of side missions. This makes it feel closer to action RPGs like Skyrim and Red Dead Redemption, which doesn't appeal at all to Tomb Raider's strengths. I also find it funny that many animations and sequences are ripped directly from Uncharted. For example, lifting a heavy object with Lara and Jonah so that one can pass at a time, or two people necessary to push a lever; sliding on high slopes to jump at the edge and reach the next platform; the many run levels as the environment collapses.\n\nOn combat, new features are: vegetation walls for stealth instead of only tall grass; mud camoflauge; buff consumables. Enemy variety is as bad as usual. All guns of a type feel the same as usual. And although stealth is slightly refined (e.g., you can now restealth from alert), it's still mediocre compared to any other stealth game as it's incredibly situational (not skill-based) on executing a full stealth kill; little player agency to approach areas; and the alert system can be bonkers.\n\nOn progression systems, skills involve a path instead of 3 tiers; outfits involve an upper and lower body each with different bonuses; and there are now merchants to trade between currencies and also allow you to purchase gear. I don't like these complexity additions as I think it adds RPG elements which Tomb Raider does not do well in. One thing I don't understand is that given the emphasis on exploration in the new game, why even add more complexity to the combat (and even a larger arsenal of weapon/armor choices) if the number of encounters is in fact a lot smaller? If I designed the game, I would drop combat altogether in favor of just stealth, and only with the knife and bow and arrow.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Beautiful as always. While the graphics upgrade from Tomb Raider (2013) to Rise was noticeable, Graphics comparisons online show that Shadow has more detail, particularly in antialiasing and lighting. Animations are reused though. The most significant is perhaps more nuance in facial expressions. The added interactions with NPCs in Shadow make the game feel cheaper: these conversations are stilted, primarily with talking heads. I like the new environments: city in Mexico, jungle in Peru, cities in Peru. Paihiti in particular is impressively large for a single-player and non-RPG game. Unfortunately, there's not much that makes the cities and towns in Shadow interesting. They feel more like hubs like in Diablo II cities with a set of questgivers and merchants, and as a stage in a linear path. The story does not tie them back and allow them to feel like actual urban locations to revist rather than as linear levels that happen to have NPCs rather than more forestry, platforming, and enemies.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Unlike the last two games, survival instinct does not highlight enemies, show next path for exploration, or show solutions to puzzles at Hard and Very Hard difficulties. This reduces (but does not remove) the need to spam Survival Instinct at every new screen. At the beginning of the game, Survival Instinct is only helpful to locate mission beacons. After upgrading skills, Survival Instinct will still show challenge objects (Owl's Wisdom), collectibles (Eagle's Sight), and enemies, resources, and objects (Owl's Vision) so you'll still need to spam it.\n+ Unlike the last game, there is no white paint on critical paths at Hard and Very Hard difficulties.\n+ Like the last game, there is no health regeneration on Hard and Very Hard difficulties.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ There's a lot more vibration in this game. The controller vibrates for example, every time Lara's axe strikes the craggy wall as she climbs up.\n+ Significant portions of levels include underwater mechanics.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Merchant and addition of an in-game currency. I liked the idea of craft materials in Rise which you must farm individually instead of being able to, e.g., farm one and just sell for a currency and then buy the rest. If there were a trading system, it should be Path of Exile-style in trading goods for other goods. I also don't like the idea of purchasing weapons/armor sets. This is closer to a generic RPG where strategic gear choices are involved. As a <20 hour action-adventure where gear largely doesn't make much of a difference, Tomb Raider should be about trying out all weapons, not forcing you to make a commitment for purchasing.\n+ Unlike the last game, weapons now have unique upgrades, causing you to be stingy with your purchases and commit to single choices rather than play with all of them.\n+ Buff consumables like Potency and Endurance mixtures.\n+ Unlike the last two games, artifacts/documents never automatically appear to their description with audio after picking them up. You have to press an additional button. I liked the pacing of the previous games where by examining each new item, you accumulate more knowledge and atmosphere of a level.\n+ Underwater is featured a lot more in this game. I hate swimming in video games.\n+ Unlike Rise, all Murals are the same image. And more broadly, all artifacts are narrated by Lara and not a distinct person!\n+ Like the last game, side quests are RPG-generic and tedious. Not worth doing.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider/\n+ criticisms i agree with (e.g., on towns, in-game currency, swimming)| https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/9mi88z/shadow_of_the_tomb_raider_is_too_mediocre_to_be/\n\nI played on PC. I played only the base game and with a total playtime of 20 hours (according to Steam) at 84% completion (did not complete all challenge tombs and side missions). The DLCs (so far as of playing) only offer challenge tombs which don't seem compulsory in terms of canon or entirely new content. I played One with the Jungle difficulty which is Hard everything (second hardest difficulty). Deadly Obssession (hardest difficulty) is inconvenient in that there are game saves only at Base Camps. This is the only major difference (https://tombraider.square-enix-games.com/fr/news/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-difficulty-and-accessibility). I played with no walkthrough, only ever using it if I'm stuck in the main campaign on a puzzle for too long or to find all the challenge tombs. I deliberately avoided the walkthrough for completionism or following along as I play the main story. I think this ruins the pacing and novelty of discovery. Progression-wise, I prioritized exploration and stealth.",

    "comments": "Uncharted The Lost Legacy is an interesting switch in pace by focusing on an unlikely duo. Unfortunately, it doesn't add anything new to the table in storytelling style, gameplay, or character dynamics---sticking instead to what has been shown to work in the series. And the story's villain drama remains insufferable as always.\n\n__Story.__ I like the focus on the duo of Chloe and Nadine. They make an unlikely but fearesome and well-matched duo as they bounce off each other in dialogue as you play the game. I actually enjoyed the story insofar as it provided depth into Chloe's background.\n\n__Gameplay.__ New lockpicking mechanic, C4, riding an elephant. Cool semi-open world in Chapter 4 that allows for a bit of freedom in the order of selecting things. Unfortunately, there's nothing to do in the open world so it's often a matter of point A to B while sightseeing. There's the additional pacing burden of driving around until you spot something, then getting out, doing something, then running back to get back in. I love it when Nadine (the AI) does tasks for you when they're nearby, e.g., pressing a button to get another stone out of the way. It adds to the constant dialogue the two are having in order to feel more immersive.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Beautiful environments like Uncharted 4. Indian urban environments and wilderness landscape is nice. It suits the backstory with Chloe well.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ I like that they take existing mechanics and subvert them. For example, there's a failed \"move the cargo to jump on top of\" and they joke about never doing it again. Or Chloe would try to pick a lock and Nadine would just smash the window to open the door.\n+ I like the use of a physical map to display where you are in Chapter 4.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ I'm not totally sure how I feel about the diversity card---what with a female Indian protagonist, female African second heroine, and an Indian villain. And clothing to not be revealing or show sexual fanservice.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Losing a 2-on-1.. and Nadine was supposed to be really good according to Uncharted 4. The scripted melee fights was also really boring.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/uncharted-the-lost-legacy/\n\nI didn't look for all Hoysala tokens to get the Queen's Ruby from the Mystery Ruin in Chapter 4. It seems tedious to drive around the map and pick up specific coins.",

    "comments": "Rise of the Tomb Raider is a refinement of the 2013 title. As a cinematic action-adventure, platforming and gunplay controls the same alongside the HUD/menus as well as progression system. Two major additions are more emphasis on tomb raiding than firefights; and crafting (both for the better). Unfortunately, story/characters remain just as bad and there are no major innovations.\n\n__Story.__ Story is mediocre---just as forgettable in plot, supporting characters, and villains as usual. It focuses on Lara's obssession for a mystery like her dad. And a native village. Unfortunately it involves histrionics in drama; c.f. Uncharted 4 for a much better execution involving depth into the protagonist as well as his relationships with the other major characters. Having a syndicate following Lara as a villain organization is also incredibly boring. Formulaic explosion and \"tragedy\" ending with various deaths. Yawn. Baba Yaga DLC was way better. Not necesarily in terms of story, but in that the setting and boss fight actually involves Tomb Raiding (i.e., a mix of platforming, puzzle solving, and combat). I thought it was interesting that they chose only Jonah to continue on in the supporting cast. And of course as a male, Jonah is fat and a different ethnicity which makes the romantic pairing more unlikely than if he were white, fit, and good-looking.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The gameplay is largely the same across platforming, gunplay, HUD/menus/progression system.\n\nI like the new platforming and combat features: sprint and fast swimming; swimming underwater with a simple LT hold/release; deep snow slows you down; you can run up the bark of trees to platform and also take down enemies; tall bushes hide you from enemy sight. Platforming overall is the best I've experienced in the genre. It feels seamless. And there are a diverse set of platforming actions: for example, pressing a button to stablize oneself if a landing is precarious; running up a wooden wall; moving laterally on an edge; moving up with an axe; rope with bow and arrow for pulling doors open, trapezing, and swinging; grappel axe; broadhead arrows for woodern platform climbing; climbing up trees; and many more. Puzzles in tombs feel like natural mind puzzles unlike Uncharted's \"Look at Nathan's journal again.\" It surpasses Uncharted's platforming.\n\nSystem-wise, the progression system is more intricate with crafting materials to craft ammunition, equipment, and start bonfires; coins for the Supply Shack shop; gear upgrades along multiple axes; and outfits (some time in-game bonuses). I think this complexity is just enough. There's more involved weapon choices but e.g. upgrades for a weapon type are universal so you don't have to squander resources and specialize. Translate system is also added, which requires finding other collectibles (leveling up a language) before unlocking relics that require translations. I also like that the health system this time requires bandages and offers at higher difficulties the lack of health regeneration. I don't know how I feel about the optional side missions. It starts to make the game feel like an RPG.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Significant improvements since the last game across face models and expression nuances, textures, and postprocessing/special effects. I like the settings of Syria, Siberian snow, and jungle/forestry in the Siberian wilderness.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Baba Yaga DLC's boss fight and the Blood Ties DLC are examples of new addon content done right. Baba Yaga's DLC boss fight is a fun mix of all gameplay elements that make Tomb Raider. Blood Ties serves excellent lore behind Lara's family and allows you to explore Croft Manor.\n+ Tomb Raider now has chapter replay options like Uncharted. This makes a complete game much more worthwhile as you get to reuse your completed arsenal to master your favorite encounters StealthGamerBR-style.\n+ Like the last game, Rise supports 21:9 (except for prerendered cutscenes).\n+ Like the last game, there is no one screaming your name as you die and raise the death screen. I find that seriously annoying in games like Uncharted and Metal Gear Solid.\n+ Like the last game, I like the bell chime noise when you're near a Tomb. It's a cool noise.\n+ Like the last game, bonfires.\n+ Crafting material has a limiting capacity. This incentivizes you to spend right away rather than do what I tend to do (and which I always regret) of hoarding.\n+ Like the last game, all the collectibles add to requirements for gear upgrades and add XP for skill points. This incentivizes 100%-ing maps as you go (or at least, to the best you can given metroidvania backtracking).\n+ Like the last game, enemy variety involves not only humans but also animals. This meshes well with the huntering and gathering theme.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ This game is a collectithon. Having multiple types of collectibles and crafting material is fine. However, there's something to collect on every screen, which can sometimes ruin pacing in favor of just collecting things. I prefer Dark Souls' approach for exploration, where there are just a handful of items but they can be valuable so you search every inch of a map.\n+ \"Missions\" are optional side quests providing more content in the rich exploratory maps in Rise. However, they're sometimes just dull---not nearly as captivating as the main campaign---and thus feel like filler content.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Unlike the last game, Survival Instinct's orange hue is only on items rather than the full screen. This makes its frequent usage not as intrusive to immersion. That said, I'd much rather not have it in the game altogether in favor of better game design to make it easier to spot items while keeping them real-world. Similar to the white markings on platformable ridges.\n+ Like the last game, there's metroidvana backtracking.\"Expeditions\" which are other gameplay modes. I'd much rather DLC augment the existing campaign like the Baba Yaga DLC.\n+ The bloat of credits you earn in game to purchase \"card packs.\" Fortunately they only affect Expeditions and not single-player mode. But I don't like that this money grubbing with ingame currency is creeping into the game.\n+ Like the last game, subtitles have an ugly font and explicitly black border.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/rise-of-the-tomb-raider/\n+ https://guides.gamepressure.com/riseofthetombraider/guide.asp?ID=33025\n+ https://tombraiders.net/stella/walks/TR10walk/collectibles/07-geothermal-valley-challenges.html\n\nI played on PC and on max settings except using SMAA anti-aliasing instead of SSAA 4x. (I played at SSAA 4x but ran into frame drop issues; my PC crashes several times at select scenes even with SMAA anti-aliasing; it could also be DirectX 12 which I have now removed; https://steamcommunity.com/app/391220/discussions/1/451852225139502097/.) PC has better graphics. PS4 benefits from the 20 Year Celebration edition, including an extra Tomb Raider III-style outfit, cooperative gameplay for endurance mode, Blood Ties, and Lara's Nightmare. These are available DLC for PC and they're the only option to purchase on Steam which I did.\n\nI played on Survivor (second hardest difficulty). Like Tomb Raider (2013), Rise is also just as easy so there's not significant pacing drops even at Survivor (https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/3sugzh/what_difficulty_should_i_select_on_rise/). The only distinction with the hardest difficulty of Extreme Survivor is game saves only at campsites. This feels like it could be inconvenient to replay any challenging moments all over again and ruin pacing. So no for a first playthrough. For upgrades, I prioritized exploration skills and ranged bow/stealth. Content order-wise, I played in chronological order: main campaign, Baba Yaga, Blood Ties. I did not complete the remaining content as they're not likely to be canon and don't add to the existing experience: Expeditions, added Endurance mode to Expeditions, Cold Darkness Awakened, Lara's Nightmare (https://tombraiders.net/stella/walks/TR10walk/dlc.html). I kept my story experience as vanilla as possible by avoiding the use of DLC outfits, weapons, and missions.\n\nI ended up doing 100% completion with a total playtime of 26 hours which I wish I didn't (including Baba Yaga but not Blood Ties). This took 4-5 hours revisiting areas and I found this incredibly tedious. It only satisfied my OCD nature. It wastes time; provides little joy out from the actual gameplay (most is following guides as a checklist; and traveling from point A to B); and it's largely a forgettable experience (if the intention is to learn more about this game, then you could better spend that time learning about the ins and outs of the design behind the game as well as video game design and industry overall). I absolutely need to stop following into the completionist trap. It's suboptimal in optimizing for the wrong objective. I like what I did for Tomb Raider (2013) in that I course through the game without guides; completing only Tombs/major optional content; and stopped right after I completed the game and explored just a little bit more.",

    "date_finished": "7/22/19",
    "comments": "Tomb Raider (2013) skillfully executes cinematic action-adventure in the light of games like Uncharted and combined with some of the elements that define a Tomb Raider game. It's a fun action-packed story offering depth into Lara's origin and under the core motif of survival rather than mystery-diving; and it features a combination of great platforming, actually good gunplay with stealth and a upgrade system, and exploration through its semi-open world and beautifully rendered environments. Compared to the Uncharted series, Tomb Raider features better gameplay across platforming, gunplay/stealth, exploration in nonlinear worlds, and progression systems; but it has a weaker story and cast, fewer excellent environments, not as memorable set pieces.\n\nFlaw-wise, the game has three major ones. First, the story and characters aside from Lara are just not good. Second, the core appeal of Tomb Raider's puzzle-solving via intricate tombs is largely dropped. Third, it get fairly repetitive in its heated action similar to Uncharted where it's wave after wave of enemies.\n\n__Story.__ This game is bleak and greatly so for being such a stark approach to the standard Indiana Jones-style formula of past Tomb Raider games and the Uncharted series. It starts from the beginning where Lara is imprisoned in a madman's cave and even gets caught in a bear trap. She wades in a pool of blood and bones. It is such a stark (and great!) contrast to the Tomb raider series and Uncharted. It's an origin story, providing good depth into Lara's beginnings. On the contrary, unfortunately every other character, from her friends and supporting cast to the villains, are all fairly one-bit characters. The story quickly remains fairly tropey as a survivor island with a weird cult. I do find it interesting what a turn Tomb Raider (2013) took---all based on the premise of searching tombs but instead the majority of the game is faced with modern man-made problems.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Tomb Raider (2013) features platforming, exploration, and third-person shooting.\n\nPlatforming is excellent in the genre. I love the interactions most of all. For example, the use of Torch for lighting and interacting with various objects. This includes other weapons such as the bow and arrow's rope mechanic and the shotgun to blast wooden barriers. I'm overall a big fan of utilizing items that work for both action and platforming. For example, even the pick axe can be used for stealth melee kills. Unfortunately, there are very few tombs in the game (none mandatory), and of those that exist, they're simply one-off puzzles rather than spanning a much longer sequence as the old Tomb Raider games. This makes the reboot feel slightly off as a successor, playing more like a generic AAA action-adventure title with firefights.\n\nEnvironments are semi-open world similar to God of War (2018) instead of single-path linear like most action-adventures. Furthermore, multiple elements incentivize exploration: collectibles like relics, documents, and GPS caches; challenges; salvage to upgrade gear; and animals to hunt for XP. There's a progression system with passive skill points, gear upgrades with a fixed set of weapons; and document and relic collectibles.\n\nCombat is a combination of fights as you wander around (sometimes animated cutscenes and confrontations) and stealth. I like the stealth elements such as utilizing the bow and arrow for stealth kills as opposed to the gun and requiring headshots for immediate kills or otherwise they yell for help. Shooting into walls distracts enemies. Stealth melee kills. Rolling is the classic Tomb Raider dodge maneuver when they swing for an attack. I love the fixed toolset. They all have excellent situational uses. The bow is particularly sweet and my personal favorite default. It has platforming utility such as fire arrows and roping to platforms; and it has combat utility as a stealth ranged kill and held-back for stronger power.\n\nDifficulty-wise, the game seems almost too easy. Enemies have really bad accuracy. Melee-type enemies are well-telegraphed and easy to shotgun away. You never really run into ammunition problems, incentivizing more diverse playthroughs as you cycle through your weapons' ammo. Enemy variety is mediocre. I wish the samurai appeared more often in the game rather than just a climactic middle gorey scene and the end.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Graphics look great and I expected especially so for 2013. Having just played Uncharted 4 before this, I can easily tell how the graphics have aged. Face models, textures, lighting, and the postprocessing on the screen feels more artificial. Scenes are often pre-rendered rather than real time. Transitions to cutscenes aren't as seamless. Debris vanishes instead of remains as part of the environment. I think what harms atmosphere most is that dark areas like caves are lit too well for the purposes of gameplay. I'd much rather have a foreboding environment. When light is in fact a scarce resource in certain areas, you can feel on edge in the game. I like that the game focuses on a singular area though (the island); it keeps the environments fairly homogenous and less video game-y like, e.g., in Uncharted where every title seems to have a snow area; jungle area; ruins area; and city area as requirements. That said, Uncharted actually is based on real regions which gives it more nuance. In contrast, Tomb Raider's island feels forgettable as yet another forestry.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ I love Tomb Raider's requirement to press a button when you land a jump that could have you fall off. This adds more thrill than say Uncharted's tendency to let you just spam the jump button.\n+ The game supports both 21:9 resolution and borderless window.\n+ You loot bodies to get loot, not some highlighted items as is gamified in many other video games.\n+ You need to access bonfires to spend skill points, upgrade gear, and fast travel. Furthermore fast travel is restricted to select bonfires. It's very Dark Souls (1).\n+ Documents, relics, and Lara's journal let you look at specific assets and also learn about lore through audio narration. They're small enough snippets that they don't feel intrusive like, for example, MGS5's audio tapes.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ I like the idea of collectibles in order to incenvitize exploration across an semi-open world. However, like God of War (2018), I always feel conflicted about the point of having useless things to collect purely for the completionism: there is no ingame benefit. Doing it within the middle of a game can ruin pacing of the main story. So you may as well do it after you beat the game, but at that point there's not really any point to doing it. Ultimately, I converged to just playing the game and trying to explore every room, collecting a good amount of collectibles but not all of them.\n+ The overlay HUD. For example, the art style when filling up a bar to pry open a door. Or all the popups when you unlock something or gain XP.\n+ Automatic system for crouching vs standing, walking vs running, and cover behind obstacles.\n+ Call of Duty/Uncharted health system.\n+ Auto saves are fairly forgiving. Pickups and collectibles are always saved so you can reload from checkpoint after picking them up instead of trekking back to a tent.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Survivor sense. I hate the detective vision/mode mechanic in almost all video games since Arkham Asylum introduced it. It allows you to toggle when to look for hidden items, keeping the environment in palette and less game-y to find interactable objects. On the other hand, it's added complexity and feels unneeded if the video game were well-designed enough to allow you to easily spot these in the first place. I find myself using it at every corner, ruining native exploration. I'm not the only one (https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/9hz3dk/the_amount_of_time_i_used_the_survival_instinct/).\n+ Metroidvania backtracking to access collectibles you couldn't on the first time you move through the area.\n+ Alternate firing mode. I never use it. It adds unnecessary complexity.\n+ There's a TR logo  during autosave. I find it distracting and breaks immersion.\n+ Subtitle art is really bad. It's black borders which makes it extremely distracting. And it's closed caption, i.e., it describes sound effects. I really like subtitles in games (and audio mediums in general) as it gives me the most detail so I don't miss out on a single word. This can happen due to heavy accents, murmuring of guards from afar, etc.\n+ Unlike Uncharted, you can't just replay missions/chapters. After the game, you can still go back to get everything you missed. But to experience the campaign again, you have to restart from scratch. New game plus has close to zero encounters as it's just exploring the map.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/tomb-raider\n+ https://tombraiders.net/stella/walks/controls/TR9controls.html\n\nI played on PC on max resolutions and with controller. It's clear this game was built for controller. The Definitive Edition on Xbox One/PS4 has some new features but compromises on texture quality over PC's: \"The PS4 version certainly sports lower resolution textures, inferior Anti-Aliasing options, lack of tessellation and certainly lower frames per second (and resolution) if your PC rig can handle it. The other side of the coin is the new facial animation systems look very nice, TressFX 2.0 is a major improvement over the original (leading to fewer times were hair acts completely strangely, such as strands going in the wrong direction), Sub-Surface Scattering and a little extra geometry.\" (https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2014-tomb-raider-definitive-edition-next-gen-face-off; http://www.redgamingtech.com/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-playstation-4-vs-pc-graphics-analysis/). By the time I realized there's a Definitive Edition, I had already sunk 2.5 hours into the game (no Steam refund and there's also no transfer of game saves). Oh well. At least, the differences are significantly noticeable (Definitive Edition was released in January 2014 when game was released in March 2013) and the PC benefits from context-switching by browsing the web and preserving the game save as PC is more universal than consoles.\n\nI played on Normal difficulty. This seems more canonical where this game is more for the adventure and seamless fun factor of the cinema---rather than the challenge which can halt pacing. I completed the game in 13 hours and 83% completion. I completed all Tombs as they're a premiere part of the game and also give weapon upgrades. I did not collect all collectibles. I did not play multiplayer.",

    "comments": "Uncharted 4 arrives as the best in the series: with an actually good, less trope-heavy cinematic story about Nate's childhood, his relationship with his brother Sam, wife Elena, and longtime friend Sully. Gameplay is improved with more stealth elements, exploration in vast spaces, and platforming opportunities across beautiful landscapes.\n\nFlaw-wise, Uncharted has always had just serviceable gameplay. It's clear what features it lacks when compared to the extreme of the best games of the third-person shooter stealth genre like Metal Gear Solid and Gears of War; as well as platforming from Tomb Raider. Uncharted also delves into histrionics and over-the-top narratives. Nate will be dangling from cliffs, on the verge of death multiple times, and every scene will have some action-packed deathgripping scenario as if they're worried the audience has a small attention span and will lose interest. Unique to Uncharted 4, the title has large open wilderness but unfortunately squanders its potential by not offering any incentive exploration like Tomb Raider (2013).\n\n__Story.__ The story is polished and more artistic this turn around with real drama, building from a longstanding relationship with Nathan's brother Sam as well as his dynamic in suburban family life with Elena. The drama is actually pretty good---exceptional for a video game. That scene with Elena after Madgascar is tense! The reveal about Sam's debt was surprising to me too. There's an ongoing list of lies: from Sam to Nathan; and Nathan to Elena. I liked the final reveal about their Drake surname. It adds a lot of depth this way rather than being an actual heir.\n\nVillains remain one-dimensional, but they do exhibit the most character compared to other main villains of the series. For example, you actually get to play with Rafe in the prison break; and Nadine Ross actually plays out like a mercenary. Plot-wise, there are too many plot holes to treat the story verbatim. The fact that Elena never knew about Nathan's brother. And that Nathan would be known (in the mercenary world) as discovering ancient cities as a legend, and yet that has zero ramification on his job opportunities. And most iconic to the series, that Nathan could kill hundreds of enemies each game and yet have slivers of humanity in sparing people when it's the actual cutscenes. Sam also should have died by the end. It makes the game's death defying moments have less impact if there are no tangible consequences.\n\n__Gameplay.__ New to the series is that at times there is actual freedom to approach combat. This greatly enhances the ability of stealth for example, which now in the series actually feels like it exists in the game. In particular is the addition of new elements: an enemy HUD bar that fills up to detect caution and alert; marking enemies; tall grass; multiple entry points. It further takes cues from MGS5 in the Madagascar levels when one drives up to a settlement and must take out all the guards. That said, it's still fairly primitive compared to games for example that are the pinnacle at this, e.g., MGS5, Hitman 2016.The paths to approaching enemies, and the arsenal that allows you to take different approaches---select toolset like melee-only, nonlethal tranquilizer-only---are not possible in Uncharted 4.\n\nI like all the details in refinements to interactivity. For examples: steering while sliding on a cliff; throwing rope so you can swing on it; holding L1 to climb up/down/repel a rope; dialogue options; no arcade-style Square/Triangle options when in melee; moving your hand at times and usingn a piton in order to grab loose positions you can platform and scale up walls on.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ A new console generation, and the effects on the aesthetics are clear. Facial expressions have more detail and therefore more nuance. Environments have greater detailing. Lighting and shadows. Gunplay feels a lot more real. There's recoil, there's a little recepticle within the cross hairs that adds to that feeling. Interestingly, there are fewer set pieces in favor of making a more cohesive (and coherent) storyline. Level designs are varied and gorgeous as usual. This time, it's an orphanage, prison, Scotland, Madagascar, King's Landing city, island expedition, New Devon. (I do like the few that are there: e.g. beauty shot of Madagascar wilderness, town of King's Bay in Madagascar, a collapsing clocktower.).\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Love the Crash Bandicoot cameo and actually playing a level.\n+ You get to play as young Nathan again. The environments are the most beautiful I've seen among video games, along the lines of God of War and Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice. I got chills during that one scene in New Devon when Nate and Elena drive up a path with Avery's statue in the background and among island forestry.\n+ You get to play as Sam.\n+ I like the addition of the grappel to add to the platforming mechanics. It's very Lara Croft. There's also a lot more moveable crates, and you even grappel to move crates sometimes.\n+ Wandering around Nathan and Elena's house.\n+ Uncharted 4 did a better in medias res than Uncharted 2 or 3. Namely, silent and flashback cuts to replay the first scene is significantly better than what 2 did of literally replaying the intro for a bit.\n+ As with all titles in the series, I like all the cooperative animation mechanics (and the cycling of companions across chapters). For example, boosting someone up to get a ladder slightly out of reach. Or cooperation to operate switches to open doors.\n+ As with all titles in the series, hints to avoid getting stuck are in this game. They're even more improved with verbal cues signalling when you can't make a jump; your companion telling you the right way after a while. Only rarely is there in-game text as the hint telling you a solution.\n+ The lost city is not yet another boring temple dungeon. This time it's a pirate settlement which adds more of an urban environment that I find interesting.\n+ I like that there's an independent strong figher woman, and also that there's a scene of him getting his ass kicked by her.\n+ The scenes where you just wander around a well-designed room and interact with the different assets there. For example, when wandering around Nathan's house; exploring the mansion as young Nathan with young Sam.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ story recap (Uncharted 1-3) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PDCJVhxB-4\n\nI didn't play with auto aim assist or any of the other accessibility options (aside from subtitles). I don't think the assist is intended as it seems like it would make gunplay __too__ automated.

    "comments": "Uncharted 3 is effectively another Uncharted 2. It's an excellent cinematic action-adventure with brilliant visual set pieces, diverse gameplay situations, and a diverse level design as the characters travel to select regions in the world for the next step of some conspiracy. Set pieces and level environment this turn around are even more astounding varying from jungles to urban sprawls to deserts to the lost city of Ubar.\n\nUnfortunately, Uncharted 3 doesn't add anything new to the series aside from improved CQC mechanics. Like Uncharted 2, it also focuses perhaps too much on a collection of amazing set pieces rather than a tight, cohesive narrative. This makes it harder to follow along why so many set pieces could plausibly happen in one story: burning chateau; sinking freightor; airplane crash; hallucination scenes in Yemen; wandering a desert; horseback chase; destruction of a lost city (https://www.reddit.com/r/uncharted/comments/8kl8qn/spoiler_uncharted_3_is_actually_better_than_2/dz92jtk/). It's perhaps this over-the-topness and emphasis on set pieces that makes me enjoy Uncharted 3 more than Uncharted 2; the story was never that interesting to begin with so I care less that all these set pieces make the story less cohesive.\n\n__Story.__ I actually really like the story this time around. It's still fairly trope-heavy with a generic mercenary evil organization. But it felt executed much better than the previous titles, particularly in providing more depth into Nate and Sully's relationship. I like the addition of the side character Charlie Cutter. Most apparently flaw-wise, I did not even know Nathan and Elena had married and were separated as an ongoing drama conflict in the story! The interactions with Elena were overall very limited leading to little depth.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Like the rest of the series, its gameplay strengths are its seamless integration into the story and wide variety of different scenes. Notable in this title for example are the hallucination scene; and the chase. The abduction scene reminds me of the setup in Metal Gear Solid. Not as cool as escaping MGS' prison cell and facing torture though.\n\nThe only addition to gameplay is CQC, which is more intricate with a counter move and more animations. It also features more often in the story starting from the very first scene to the last boss.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Excellent as usual and just the same as Uncharted 2. The Uncharted series is explicitly designed with visually and technically astounding set pieces in mind, and that's no more apparent than in Uncharted 3. This time, it's London, a chateau in France (with a burning scene!), Yemen, a shipyard with a sinking freightor, flying off an airplane, a desert, and a lost city.\n\nOverall, Uncharted like many games has a tendency to exhibit a diverse collection of environments for levels by showing completely different countries and subregions in the world. This often feels forced to make the story shoehorn to capture all of them. It also makes the collection of areas overall forgettable. For example, I can't easily recall the main areas that defines where the adventure of Uncharted 1, 2, and 3 took place. I'd much rather a title focus on a specific area, say, New York in Marvel's Spider-Man. Then dig deep into expanding the culture, subareas of the city/region, and further.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Hints, which as in all Uncharted games help keep the game from breaking pace and resorting to walkthroughs as you get stuck too long on a puzzle.\n+ For once, there are no supernatural beings. You do fight a supernatural enemy but it's restricted to one chapter and only the result of a hallucinogen.\n\nI did not play multiplayer.",

    "comments": "Uncharted 2 is a refinement of the original game, improving the cinematic experience with a more compelling story, added characters, and excellent visual set pieces as stages within the game. Combat is slightly improved---particularly with an added stealth element---and more variety to the gameplay exists beyond the original game's tendency to have wave-after-wave of fighting enemies. Combat/platforming is clearly not what makes Uncharted an excellent series, but it is decent enough to enjoy the overall cinematic experience.\n\n__Story.__ Standard fanfare story again with a generic character. Character dynamics shine through most though (but not technically that interesting as uninspired characters). I like the additional of another female main character. The dynamics work well among Nathan, Elena, and Chloe. Having the protagonist be a mid-20s to 30 year old and play sexual and exgirlfriend jokes makes the game feel more mature. Like the gameplay, the story also changes setting and accompanying characters often to not get old.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Most noticeable improvement to the gameplay are occasional stealth elements. It doesn't make it easy to go full stealth since options are limited and signs of enemy awareness are few. But it adds diversity to Uncharted 1's monotonous gunplay. There are also slight upgrades like the melee system to press triangle whenever enemies deflect your Square spam. It's still not all that great, but it's decent to keep the gameplay with platforming and gunplay/stealth as you learn more about the story. Redditors agree and is the most popular criticism of the series (https://www.reddit.com/r/uncharted/comments/7veze1/playing_uncharted_3_again_and_wow_what_happened/). This is why Uncharted plays best on easier difficuties where the gameplayâs occasionally frustrating and tedious moments become a lot fewer.\n\nGameplay is impressively varied as the story demands it so you don't get bored. For example, running from a car trying to mow you down. Two helicopter fights, one RPG-based and another anti-air. One tank. Carrying around a limping guy. Explicit stealth scenes. Explicit confrontation scenes. A drive-by scene. Sniper scene.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ It's clear that Uncharted 2 was designed with brilliant visual set pieces, starting from the very first scene of scaling a train off the edge of a cliff. Also notable is climbing the giant golden statue. The urban city levels are especially astounding in diversity and layout. Also the Tibetan village. Uncharted 2 easily shines through most here. Graphics look a lot better than Uncharted 1 and even feel like a modern game in 2019. For example, the face model graphics are less noticeably non-modern. The sprawling environments also are rich in content even if their detailing is not as modern.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Like the last game, I like that all chapters are continuously integrated. Makes it extremely easy to just rush through the game.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Stealth is funny in this game. By design, certain scenes are constructed to be confrontation-based. Even for areas with optional stealth, it's difficult to get all enemies stealthwise unless you're willing to wait a very long time to cycle their patrols and use the very limited options to you. Many levels do not enable progression without killing all enemies---as opposed to the stealth standard of just bypassing them. All enemies alert at the immediate sound of a gun regardless of distance; same goes for enemies that spot you. That said, I like that the checkpoint system effectively encourages a hybrid of stealth followed by going Rambo as you soon as you're caught instead of just restarting.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ I think the idea of a white guy saved by a rural Tibetan village. And then it demolished, is classic whitewashed bullshit. This is Anglocentric to the extreme.\n+ As per the last game, the amount of henchman, and the location of the henchman are impressively stupid. It's like an entire army is against them.\n+ The difficulty curve for fights in Chapter 25 is way too high. Way steeper than previous games.\n+ Certain sublevels to get through areas are nonintuitive and/or tedious.\n+ There's at least 6 dangling off the cliff scenes.. What a cliche shot.\n+ There are no zombies, but the supernatural version of beast-humans in this title is still kind of dumb that they exist.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/uncharted-2-among-thieves\n\nI did not play multiplayer.",

    "comments": "Uncharted sets the stage for the cinematic action-adventure genre: a decent story and set of main and supporting characters alongside great visual set pieces and orchestral music. Gameplay-wise, it's a platformer and third-person shooter. Platforming is decent; third-person shooter is mediocre at best and tedious otherwise.\n\n__Story.__ It's classic Indiana Jones rife with a charismatic humorish lead, good supporting characters, a mystery treasure plot and setting, and good mix of comedy and action-adventure. That dynamic with Elena Fisher is decent, as well as the best friend Sully. It's tropey but it works; I would watch it as a fluff film.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Gameplay comprises two forms: platforming; and third-person gunplay with a cover system.\n\nPlatforming controls are similar to Tomb Raider, e.g., controls available from a ledge. Platforming is decent but not innovative in any way, in fact just as similar as Tomb Raider 1 but with even less depth. Fortunately puzzles are fewer, and any puzzles are a lot more mainstream and less obscure, making it fun to go through. Overall, platforming in Uncharted series as a whole is nice compared to Tomb Raider in that there are not insanely frustrating jumps at occasion which hamper the experience. On the other hand, Unchartedâs platforming is so simplified that once can simply mash a button to jump and the autoaim always takes care of it.\n\nGunplay is standard fanfare and just a mediocre experience. All guns of a specific type (shotgun, sniper rifle, assault rifle, pistol) feel the same. It lacks freedom to approach areas with enemies and take down enemies. For example, there is no stealth to navigate around areas and assassinate (to be added in Uncharted 2 and all future games I guess). You just hide in an area and cover-shoot going from one area to the next. Lots of miscellaneous henchman as meat sponges. Zero enemy variety. The drive-by scenes provide a good change of pace but still only decent; there should be more alternatives like these. The switch between dynamic and fixed camera angles during platforming can sometimes be jarring.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Decent graphics that work even in 2019. Constrained face models and expressions are the most difficult to bear. Everything else is great. The sound is like a AAA film; love the orchestra.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ I like having the old man around to give hints whenever you're stuck (and then an in-game mechanic after he dies). It keeps the pacing on the story and action-adventure rather than puzzles which I hate.\n+ Minimal HUD.\n+ No underwater swimming mechanic. God I hate swimming in video games. It's such a different gameplay movement and battle mechanic than the rest of the game. And it's often just not good.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Treasures are missable. That said, you can replay chapters to find any you missed the first time through.\n+ Health system is Call of Duty like instead of a bar.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ That level where you must go up the river. Those controls, dodging barrels, and fighting rocket launcher enemies is frustrating.\n+ This gameâs light hearted atmosphere clearly works best with less than normal difficulty. This lets you breeze by tedious gunfights.\n+ Zombies. What a dumb enemy.\n+ I really prefer the modern action-adventure approach of having white dots put on interactable objects in the environment like in Sekiro and God of War. Similarly, Dark Souls and God of Wars games have subtle highlights to mark items. It makes it easier to identify what's actually dynamic in the environment. Otherwise you can easily get lost and feel like you're just walking in a static world. There's a few highlights like sparkles in game, but not nearly enough.\n+ The running, jumping, swimming, and ratcheting from ledges animations are all pretty wimpy compared to Lara's in Tomb Raider Anniversary.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/uncharted-drakes-fortune/Walkthrough\n\nI played it on PS4, which is a remastered version including 1080p over the original's 720p and 60 fps over 30 fps: textures, higher polygon count, better lighting, the works; and also some improved cover+combat system which videogamedunkey likes! (6:22 in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziUMJB3id8I). As of 2019-07-07, it's also not playable on RPCS3. I was most inspired to play this after just playing God of War, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, and Tomb Raider: Anniversary, all of which set my platforming and cinematic action-adventures. I played on Normal difficulty up until Chapter 13 in which I played on Easy. Difficulties just change the amount of damage taken and damage output (https://uncharted.fandom.com/wiki/Difficulty). Gunplay is not a great part of the game and can be tedious and occasionally frustrating. Playing on easy streamlines the experience for what matters most: the story and platforming.",

    "comments": "Platforming, switches, moving blocks, deadly traps, the occasional physical enemy outside the environment. These elements are what define (old-school) Tomb Raider. I really enjoy these elements with the exception of puzzles in dungeons, which I personally find tedious. (I just followed along with a video walkthrough for the last two dungeon sets. It let me purely enjoy the platforming while not thinking too much about the sometimes convoluted puzzles.) Combat is also not good, and the Anniversary version is rife with bugs. Camera angles and some frustrating platforming at times can really hamper the experience.\n\n__Story.__ It actually exists a bit more than the sparse original version. It's still rather banal and nonexistent. Serviceable at best.\n\n__Gameplay.__ I love the platforming aspect, and where the enemy is more often traversing the environment with its variety of traps than physical enemies like in generic action-adventures. Anniversary also cleaned up the controls of the original clunky game. It added new animations which made platforming (specifically, parkouring) and exploring dungeons to be a treat. Specific ideas like weaving back and forth to gain more momentum in a jump, and holding down the Jump button to jump farther, adds to the tension.\n\nPlaying this, I can't tell how much to rate it based on any innovations that the original game in 1996 did that helped start tropes for the action-adventure genre---at the same time as Super Mario 64. I don't know even know what those innovations: for example, 3D third-person shooter in dungeon crawling with puzzles; parkour platforming; checkpoint system; interact button for the catch-all actions and animations; great graphics at the time; quick time events. Playing it now, like many classic 3D games, it has clunky controls and camera. It's primarily a platformer with puzzle and only with some combat however, so this wasn't a dealbreaker.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Gamebreaking at the time, but really bad now.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Tomb Raider: Anniversary is one of the first games to sport secret collectibles which rewards exploration. It also shows up in the Croft Manor as your achievement and in Anniversary offers new outfits, character bios, and art galleries.\n+ Minimal HUD.\n+ Croft Manor. Fun place to explore and toy with the butler.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ The ending with the mercenary enemies is surpisingly more brutal than I expected..\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Combat is really bad. It's very easy to cheese enemies where they suddenly stop moving and you just shoot them until they die.\n+ Autocenter camera. Annoying and often clashes with player's manual control leading to a jittery camera as they fight back-and-forth.\n+ I don't know if it's incompability with Windows 10 and modern drivers. But the game is quite buggy. Some are cosmetic, like Lara's hair tail acting as if it were its own entity. But some really bad like game crashes, a jittery camera, clipping through areas so you can't land jumps, or have pillars be unremovable with the grapple until you turn on V-sync.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/tomb-raider-anniversary/\n\nI chose this as my first Tomb Raider game (https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/32o601/which_tomb_raider_game_should_i_play_first/). I played Tomb Raider 2 (or was it 3?) in my childhood, but I really only played in the mansion with the butler. I never made it past the first zone. I also watched that film with Angelina Jolie. It's a faithful rehaul of the first game and also serves as the first game to the first of two Tomb Raider reboots. From here, I can decide to continue with the next two games in the first reboot trilogy (Legend, then Underworld) or start the second trilogy with Tomb Raider (2013). I decided against starting with the second trilogy as it plays very differently from what makes Tomb Raider iconic, focusing more on action-adventure with a cinematic story and gunplay similar to Uncharted; this would bias my experience of the rest of Tomb Raider, which is more based on exploration and puzzle-solving within the tombs.

Great ending though, particularly with the way new powers actually make a gameplay difference. Ora being a hallucination the whole time, and the idea that going against Azai could purely have been through the evils of the Mark.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Stealth is very slick with features including interactive lighting, expanding circles to capture enemy and your own sound, vents to hide, walls to mount, areas to hide. It's a linear platformer but with excellent stealth elements that appeal to its core art and ninja vibe. I especially love the kill animations and the need to execute an additional quick command to succesfully silent kill; it adds to the tension and skill. There are a handful of core tools to assist but are in no way required.

    "comments": "Chaos Theory plays surprisingly well in 2019. It's clearly one of the best stealth games with excellent use of lighting cues, sound, and an arsenal of tools and approaches to sneak around. Enemy AI is great. Level designs are varied. On the cons, the story is mediocre.\n\n__Story.__ I didn't really pay any attention to it. Didn't seem very interesting. I do like the characters and the mix of Sam Fisherman humor along with his radio supporting characters like the equivalent of Naomi Campbell of a younger female to add perspective to an old grim guy's perspective.\n\n__Gameplay.__ I love the granularities of stealth for lighting and sound. For example, you can control your movement speed which allows you lower the footstep noise below the ambient noise. With the light receptor UI, you can also wander essentially in the open as long as it's dark enough and use your pistol to electronically disable the lights temporarily. Goggles offer nightvision, thermal heat vision, electromagnetic field vision, and electronically enhanced vision. The other gear is also excellent: knife; CQC and acrobatic moves; pistol; silenced rifle; shotgun. There is still a dated feel to it: for example, guards can disappear from their patrol positions entirely and no other guards that intersect patrols are curious.\n\nMissions are typically linear with just a handful of different approaches to get to a subarea. I found this worked well for its style. It still suits all the major gameplay styles for stealth: no alerts+0 kills+0 knockouts; no alerts+some knockouts; and no alerts+all kills; and with different restrictions on weapons (e.g., melee only, pistol only).\n\nEnemy AI is also not so stupid in terms of patrol patterns and vision is not completely obvious but still game-ifiable via the use of the light receptor and audio UI.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Graphics were apparently one of the best at its release. Playing it now in 2019, it actually still holds up pretty well and I'm not bothered as much by it as I was bothered, say, playing Oblivion in 2019. Maybe it's just because of the low lighting in most of the gameplay combined with nightvision. The face model's low details are the most jarrying however. Lighting with shadows and object lights are really good. I also really like the variety of levels such as the Bank, New York, Hokkaido, and a North Korean missile base.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ The light receptor and sound UIs (including tracking of your noise vs ambient noise).\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Quicksaves and quickloads as the crutch over well-placed checkpoints.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ The map UI is extremely bad. I find it almost entirely unusable to find where to go next. This is typically fine for mission objectives since you'll come across them as you explore each room. But exfiltration is particularly hard to find, so I always just look it up.\n+ Success rating criteria seems a little arbitrary. For example, you can take damage and you can knock out as many enemies as you'd like.\n+ There are no reinforcements. Knockouts are effectievly permanent without a timer, as long as someone does not wake them up.\n+ There's no in-game reward to high success rating (and which includes completing non-mandatory mission objectives). The only reward is pride.\n+ The boss battle in the second-to-last level Bathhouse is not good.. I don't play Splinter Cell for ill-equipped action and perfect-sighted AI.\n+ Alt tab doesn't work.\n+ The tutorial is simply a collection of videos. This has zero interactivity and is lazy, not even giving the ability to pause, fast forward, etc. to the important pieces.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ improving pc guide (I did intro skips, custom resolutions and UI adjustments, and field of view) | https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=728093866\n+ https://www.ign.com/faqs/2005/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-3d-100-requisites-list-606755\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-chaos-theory/Walkthrough\n\nI decided to play this as my second foray into the Splinter Cell series since playing the first game on PlayStation as a kid (or maybe I didn't play it and it was just the relatively similar and named Syphon Filter).

Most notoriously, there's way too much asset reuse in the game: from AI voice acting and face templates to entire levels. Enemy variety is poor, and the cutscenes reek of mostly nonexistent animation, and poor animation whenever it is animated.\n\n__Story.__ Plain.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Stealth is good. It's a classic affair in stealth, where as a thief, combat is not really an option. Instead, it emphasizes use of lighting for specifically better camoflauge, sound, smell (distance from elf enemies), and open world approaches. This makes plain stealthy actions very core to the gameplay such as hiding in shadows and extinguishing torches. I also like the idea of leaning against a wall. Patrols feel a little too mechanical however. They follow an obvious pattern independent of one another and in a clear grid-like structure with up-down-left-right movements. Enemy variety is paltry.\n\nQuick save/loads are also helpful and a staple. But it leads to a save-scumming pattern where you vie for perfection and constantly reload the game.

It's a cinematic experience, a more gripping story with its father-and-son tale similar to Last of Us that adds depth but also remains a little too soppy and American. It's an over-the-top thrill ride in carnage and bombastic music. The innovative combat with the Leviathan Axe and Blades is closer to Dark Souls in dodging, parrying, and weak/strong attacks than its predecessors, but also combines elements such as Runic attack cooldowns. Finally, the world is a metroidvania.\n\n__Story.__ Decent story. That actually involves character depth, drama, and good supporting characters. Atreus' soppy moralism can get on my nerves at times, and he feels almost American in his culture which perturbs me.\n\n__Combat.__ God of War stands out in its third-person over-the=shoulder combat system paired with a bow-and-arrow companion. It's Dark Souls lite, but it also adds its own unique flavors from God of War. In particular, Runic attacks make combat more cooldown-intensive via light and heavy Runic attacks, Talisman, and Atreus' summon. There is a more complex moveset overall. Fights include a companion and involves juggling multiple enemies. Throwing Kratos' axe is also excellent. The different moveset complexity with AoE, single-target melee, and ranged offer variety to approaching enemies. I also like God of War's stun bar and immediate death action, similar to Sekiro. Climbing walls feels very intuitive and fun, similar to Sekiro.\n\nViewpoint is third-person over-the-shoulders, and I hate this limited FOV. I think the novel attempt is nice, but the ability to see behind you limits 360 degree combat and the HUD and controls has to fight against this limitation.\n\nBosses are servicable but not really great in God of War. Enemy variety is similarly a little stale. What's most disappointing is the tendency to reuse boss designs and what would seem like otherwise unique animations (e.g., the death kill scene against giants when Kratos would jump on top of the giant's head, grab his stone weapon, and drop it onto of the giant).\n\nThe world is designed as a metroidvania. Level designs feel a little too streamlined, similar to Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice in having beautiful forestry environments but invisible boundaries, some forced puzzle-solving, etc. Sometimes it's a walking simulator. With that said, there's an excellent mix of backtracking in travel for the main story/side quests and teleportation. Individual levels offer enough sidetreks to incentivize exploring to get artifacts, loots, etc.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ I really like the graphics. CGI is done well. Terrain, lighting, environments add to the cinematic experience. I would go through the various terrains and gawk at its beauty. The sound is servicable.\n\nSpecific memories:\n\n+ Doing the Queen Valkyrie for hours. Then I slept on it. Did it second try the morning of.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ No missables. Anything you miss can be gone back to get like Odin's Ravens. Even chests with materials that you miss you can be purchased over later as no materials except the final armor pieces are finite.\n+ Minimal HUD.\n+ Very smooth transitions, often blurring the distinction between cutscenes and gameplay.\n+ When deciding between taking one of two routes, the main mission compass almost always tells you the right direction. This lets you explore the offpath to find loot.\n+ All the little cues that signal that something is interactive or special, e.g., the yellow signs pointing to areas you can climb, the blue things you hit, the white dots to things you can interact with.\n+ Your level is a function of your gear rather than an additional system of XP.\n+ No multiplayer.\n+ Difficulty and uniqueness of each valkyrie battle.

Even items you forget to loot that are important can be found in the Lost Items tab when talking to the merchant.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Target lock system is extremely wonky, particularly with the multiple enemy fights and third-person view where enemies can quickly escape your camera. The pseudo lock system in automatically moving your character to the nearest enemy is at least intuitive.\n+ Streamlined upgrade and crafting system (similar to, e.g., Spiderman). It makes the game feel more video-gamey and artificial.\n+ Metroidvania backtracking with new powers to unlock new paths and items.\n+ Procedurally generated dungeon-grinding in Niflheim for the best gear (Izaldi, on par with Valkyrie). That said, fortunately grinding is easy in that there are no loading screens per reload.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/god-of-war-2018\n+ gear progression | https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWar/comments/8zmy6j/best_armour_at_different_stages_of_the_game/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWar/comments/8xy90q/best_atreus_summon/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWar/comments/9etf45/best_runic_attacks/\n\n I chose the \"Balanced\" difficulty. I switched to \"Give me a Challenge\" when entering Helheim and switched back whenever it was too hard (for most of the game, I did not craft any items and upgraded only weapons and spent Hacksilver for specific skills). To best appreciate the game, I played without a walkthrough (with exceptions to solve any puzzles I would be stuck on for too long). I love games that allow this vanilla style of playing without losing out on anything. I did not complete side quests (Favors) until I got the Winds of Helheim power because by then I'll have everything needed to access all the goodies around the place and not have to revisit areas again (with certain exceptions). I also completed them before finishing the main story in order to force myself to play them and not just quit once I beat the main game.\n\ntodos\n\n+ map completion | including nifhleim realm tears, max health and rage",

    "comments": "Darkest Dungeon is unique in its direction: a harrowing roguelike with innovative mechanics such as the torch lighting system, affliction system, provisions, quirks, diseases, Curios, Death's Door, camping, and town events; as well as a strong art style with its visuals, wordsmith narrator, and music. It's famously difficult. Learning to mitigate and tilt randomness in your favor is the name of the game. Every encounter can lead to close calls: for example, you can be teetering on death over heroes at Death's Door and 100% stress; all attacks have a chance of miss via accuracy and stat resists; characters can die from RNG crits and afflictions (and often do over the course of a campaign); and enemies can call reinforcements if you take too many turns to end an encounter. Characters die permanently. Quests can fail or be abandoned.\n\nFlaw-wise, Darkest Dungeon is too grindy in its repetition: campaigns require too much progression time in its 50-100 hour campaign playtime via leveling up characters and buildings before proceeding to each boss. Rather than entirely new content, higher-level dungeons reuse existing areas, with the same enemies with scaled stats, and occasionally feature a new enemy. I would also prefer Darkest Dungeon tone down the long RPG progression system in its interesting combination of roguelike---namely, have campaigns be shorter and more standalone much like any other roguelike (e.g., Slay the Spire). This makes the game a lot more pickup-able and replayable than having to continue or restart a 50+ hour campaign.\n\n__Combat.__  It builds well on core mechanics in the roguelike dungeon crawler genre such as procedural dungeons, positioning, stats, and statuses.\n\nI love the dungeon meta where each fight is about damage mitigation. It's a race to destroy the ranged, typically stress damage dealers, followed by a recovery phase in which you stunlock the 1-2 remaining trash mobs while HP/stress-healing. Bosses are a race to avoid dying from HP or stress where ideally your party composition has enough DPS against the boss' positioning.\n\nThe game is too grindy. Here's a good example: \"Kind of starting to feel grindy already, in the sense that in order to do Veteran quests, I need level 3's, but by the time my guys get to level 3, they have a bunch of diseases/afflictions/quirks so they need a week each to get healed, and a ton of money is required to do that... so I need to recruit some fresh fodder to go do some more beginner quests to get some money to heal up my vets, and then I need fresh fodder to make money to heal up my new vets, and so on.\" (https://steamcommunity.com/app/262060/discussions/0/458604254459963335/)\n\n__On difficulty.__ I personally found the difficulty scaling from Apprentice to Veteran to Champion to Darkest really well done. Apprentice gave me the first Darkest Dungeon feeling where every encounter felt perilous as I didn't know how to play the game. I would lose a character or two, get huge stress on the rest, and/or even party wipe. That was also a lot more rewarding in its risk as it felt even more likely that I could die from each encounter. Then it was steamrolling as I understood the mechanics and did my research by studying town buildings, class movesets, party compositions, quirks, provisions, and curio interactions. Veteran was a little more challenging but still quite manageable---only in boss encounters do I get at Death's Door or close to 100 stress. Starting Champion, my first dungeon had a hero die after the second encounter, leading to abandon it. Every encounter with my level 5 heroes with only a weapon upgrade felt close to abysmal.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The visuals have a striking gothic crowquill art style. The soundtrack and narrator add to the atmosphere.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://darkestdungeon.gamepedia.com/Expeditions_Guide (I always have this up when playing)\n+ https://darkestdungeon.gamepedia.com/Curio (I always have this up when playing)\n+ https://darkestdungeon.gamepedia.com/Quirk (I always have this up when playing)\n+ Yewb's beginner guide | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjEYqeG-4sc\n+ FilthyRobot's beginner and class guides | https://www.youtube.com/user/FilthyRobotChannel/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=53\n+ party composition guide | https://www.reddit.com/r/darkestdungeon/comments/9vyql7/beginners_guide_to_party_composition_and_supplies/\n+ class role tiers | https://www.reddit.com/r/darkestdungeon/comments/7mwupc/rank_the_class_from_best_to_worst_including_dlc/\n+ FilthyRobot's quirk guide | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9mQCuMvwvw&lc=UgyX-fxFxMvZ1Vs27kl4AaABAg\n+ playthroughs | https://www.reddit.com/r/darkestdungeon/comments/6n0ffg/any_good_playthroughs_people_would_recommend/\n\nI played it on PC. My first playthrough was on Darkest difficulty without any DLCs. This entry does not include DLCs. Darkest is apparently more grindy, where the major differences in Radiant is less time to uipgrade buildings, heroes receiving more XP, and heroes can go back to lower-dungeons that they would otherwise refuse on Darkest. Darkest feels closer to a crushing rogue-like dungeon-experience where learning comes at the price of a __lot__ of dead characters and frustration. I'd rather play the true experience once I have an idea of everything in the game---monsters, traps, conditions, etc. To do so, I'll play campaigns, fail fast, and try again within the same campaign (namely, continuing the campaign always keeps more progress than restarting).\n\nMy roster composition is:\n\n+ 1 Abomination (Blight DoTs / Stunner)\n+ 1 Antiquarian (Money)\n+ 1 Arbalest (Direct Damage Dealer)\n+ 1 Bounty Hunter (Direct Damage Dealer / Stunner)\n+ 1 Crusader (Direct Damage Dealer / HP Healer / Stress Healer / Stunner)\n+ 1 Grave Robber (Direct Damage Dealer)\n+ 2 Hound Master (Direct Damage Dealer / Stress Healer / Stunner)\n+ 2 Hellion (Direct Damage Dealer / Stunner)\n+ 1 Highwayman (Direct Damage Dealer)\n+ 2 Jester (Bleed DoTs / Direct Damage Dealer / Stress Healer)\n+ 1 Man at Arms (Direct Damage Dealer / Guard / Stunner)\n+ 2 Occultist (HP Healer, Stunner)\n+ 2 Plague Doctor (Blight DoTs / Stunner)\n+ 3 Vestal (HP Healer / Stunner).\n\nTo simplify my roster and party compositions, I typically never use Leper and Antiquarian; rarely use Buffs, Clean Corpses, Guard, Mark, and Pull; remove the worst quirks (dangerous forced interaction quirks, Damage, Stress, Bleed/Blight/Stun resist); lock in good quirks (Accuracy & Crit vs specific enemies but not specific areas, Damage excluding specific areas, Speed, Bleed/Blight/Stun resist); and I use at least one of each class, typically two unless they're mediocre. (Above, I only have 1 Abomination. This is done by process-of-elimination as I find his beast form only useful for race battles like bosses, which is rare; otherwise his human form's Stun/Blight is worse than Plague Doctor.) Party composition-wise, I select based on lowest level and stress in my roster, 1 HP healer, and everyone else situationally based one who's available, their existing negative/positive perks, and available dungeons. I only do bosses when my party is at the highest available resolve levels for them. City-wise, I started by Stagecoach until roster of 20 or 24 and 4 recruits; Guild and Blacksmith; then Treatment Ward. I neved spent heirlooms on the Abbey or Tavern (heirlooms spent elsewhere mean larger roster, better recruits, and better combat all of which translate to lower stress), Nomad (use trinkets you pick up), or Survivalist (I don't rely on camping).\n\n7 low-levels: 1 arbalest, 1 bounty hunter (done), 1 crusader (done), 1 grave robber (done), 1 grave robber, 1 hellion (done), 1 highwayman, 1 leper (done), 1 man at arms (done).\n\nI played a total of 43 hours (according to Steam). I played up to Champion dungeons and killed 1 Champion boss.",

    "comments": "Bayonetta revels in its stylishness: excellent orchestral music, sexual innuedos and fanservice, seamless transitions from cinematics to fights, film cuts, boss designs, and lovingly animated movesets and finishers. Like creator Hideki Kaimya's other well-known series Devil May Cry, Bayonetta's direction is over-the-top and comical, fitting the hack-and-slash genre well. Core combat is excellent. The plot is fun B-rated nonsense and characters are one-sided yet quirky. Bayonetta is also a surprisingly challenging game at times, toning down the otherwise aggressive pacing of the fight in favor of control and timing.\n\n__Story.__ Not great but serviceable. The characters are fun.\n\n__Combat.__ Combat is smooth with core punch/kick, weapons, temporary items, and stylishly animated action moves. I love the sequences with Wicked Weaves to provide satisfying combo finishers, Witch Time which provides a statisfying reward to dodging an enemy attack, Torture Attacks as finisher moves, quick time events (QTEs), and Beast Trigger. Health replenishment is rare. I prefer this hack-and-slash combat over Devil May Cry's. The moveset is not as deep as Devil May Cry, and I love Bayonetta all the more for it: I was never into Devil May Cry's confusingly huge moveset not unlike fighting games. I also like that there isn't an SSS-like rating system for chaining combos, in favor of more a little bit more pacing instead of pure aggression.\n\nThe minigames are a nice change of pace. For example, the Angel arcade bullet time; motorcycle sequence; Chapter 14's aerial combat.\n\nGear variety is somewhat standard with enough variety for a hack-and-slash: hand and feet weapons; accessories; items; new movesets.\n\n__Aesthetics & Music.__ The aesthetics keep the game fresh alongside its stylish animations and music. On the other hand, the level designs are mediocre. And the film cuts can be annoyingly cheap after a while as it's not fully animated.\n\n## References and Miscellanea\n\nInspired to play this from its general positive reception, integration into Super Smash Bros as an iconic game of video game history, 11 hour playtime according to howlongtobeat.com, and a recent personal marathon of action-style RPGs: Dark Souls series, Devil May Cry, Nioh, Bloodborne, Sekiro.

    "comments": "Unlike other Elder Scrolls games, Oblivion excels most in its guild quests and a mixed bag of side quests. It also features combat refinements and voice-acting for the first time (with mixed reception). For the better, it retains a lot of Morrowind's complexity with starting classes, weapon/armor conditions, speechcraft, lockpicking, spell variety, and progression system via major/minor skills and attribute bonuses.\n\nLike all Elder Scrolls games, Oblivion has mediocre combat; a significant amount of bugs; lazy level designs with asset reuse across towns, houses, and dungeons; a mediocre main quest; and UI issues. Unique to Oblivion, it also suffers from three core issues: 1. the worst level scaling in the series, including level-scaled enemies for the first time, attribute bonuses, levelled quest rewards, and levelled gear drops such as random bandits dropping full glass sets; 2. the worst world-building, with a generic fantasy setting with little diversity, and sparse cities and settlements; and 3. streamlined RPG elements from Morrowind such as standalone mini adventures in questlines that never intersect, including the ability to join all factions; fast travel; quest markers; not being able to kill essential NPCs; no weapon-type-specific skills; magicka can no longer fail; and no difference between minor and miscellaneous skills.\n\n__Story.__ Like Morrowind and unlike Skyrim, Oblivion is consisently good across its many questlines (aside from its mediocre main quest). They have more variety than Skyrim quests as they often involve dialogue with speechcraft for example, not just another camp or dungeon to raid, or involve travel across cities so questing effects feel more lasting than a local area. These varieties are what I find most appealing in Elder Scrolls as the environment interaction and skills system is largely what distinguishes the series from other RPGs as well as a good novel or movie. This is also why Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood consistently provide the best guild questlines in the series. Oblivion's Thieves Guild questline would have you talking to town beggars for information, trespassing and stealing, pickpocketing, lighting up dark passages, planting evidence. I also like the Oblivion's Mages Guild beginning questline: it requires traveling around to all cities' local Mages Guild so you could get a recommendation to enter Arcane University. This is a lot more immersive than the Skyrim's College of Winterhold. The new addition of the Arena faction is also great, rife with colorful characters.\n\n__Gameplay & Combat.__ The attributes and spell variety is just as good as Morrowind. It enables a lot of experimentation such as leveling up acrobatics to jump across buildings and spellmaking for absolutely broken (read: fun!) combos. Core combat however still remains clunky, but is at least an improvement over Morrowind's even more RNG-based and clunky melee system.\n\nOblivion's level scaling is notoriously bad. Leveled items force players to delay certain quests such as advancing in guilds until they reach the leveled item limit (level 30). With level scaling, I prefer Skyrim's approach: all but a handful of unique and special armor sets from quest rewards are not leveled, and the only leveled ones are generic items. Alternatively, take Morrowind's approach of [no level scaling for powerful regions and selective level scaling otherwise](https://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/3ccy7i/eli5_why_is_the_level_scaling_in_this_game_so/csude28). In addition, like Morrowind, Oblivion's attribute bonuses system causes a tedious leveling playstyle where you must deliberately pace your skill-leveling in order to better level up certain attributes. Combined with level scaling, this means if you level up too inefficiently, you may end up being worse as the game progresses.\n\nUnlike Skyrim's dungeons, Oblivion's are fortunately not as stupidly linear. With that said, the Oblivion gates are notoriously repetitive as there are 50 to complete overall (although only 3 required for quests) and only 5 levels recycled over that 50.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Cyrodill is clearly aimed toward Romanesque and Far Eastern cultures. However, the result is a generic medieval setting with little uniqueness that actually attests to specific culture and details. The environment is largely the same across Cyrodill whereas Morrowind had distinct regions with prairies, deserts, swamplands, artic regions, and volcanic wastelands. Spells are bland color palette swaps, which is pretty inexcusable in 2008. Similarly, like all Elder Scrolls games, dungeons and many locations are bland recopies from asset reuse to layouts.\n\nFunnily enough, playing in 2019 and after Skyrim with all the crazy graphics mods, I don't find vanilla Oblivion to be that bland in visuals. It may be because the textures look a lot like WoW, and I'm okay with those graphics. What I do find bad however is that it's more expansive as Skyrim's cities and as expansive as WoW, but the amount of NPCs is a lot smaller so cities look like desert towns.\n\nMost ambitiously, Oblivion is the first game in the series to employ voice acting for all its dialogue. This has mixed reception as there are only half a dozen voice actors for all NPCs. This can cause some jarring dialogue (including NPCs with lines from two different voice actors), occasionally forced generic responses to reuse voice-acted lines. Worst of all, there are fewer NPCs in towns compared to Morrowind, making the world feel a lot more empty.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Like Morrowind, the questing UI is detailed and incentivizes you to read through it to understand things. In contrast in Skyrim, quests are more streamlined in offering prescriptive directions as bullet points. This ruins the immersion in favor of an instruction manual.\n+ Like Morrowind, there are weapon and armor conditions.\n+ Spell effectiveness is affected by light/heavy armor. This is a good incentive for mages to wear robes proper to their class fantasy.\n+ Speechcraft, haggle, and lockpicking minigames. Unlike Morrowind, they're actual minigames and not random chances of success.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Oblivion introduced quest markers for the first time. This streamlined the questing experience so you didn't have to learn the details, only the instructions. While simpler, the cost is a lack of incentive in the immersion and minimal story-understanding.\n+ Dialogue zooms into the NPCs' face rather than the more holistic body shot view and minimalistic dialogue UI of Skyrim.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Fast travel (newly introduced in Oblivion). It kills the scale of the game. Fast travel is a workaround to another flaw: not packing enough content in the traveling areas to begin with. I prefer Morrowind's network of Silt Striders and Mage's Guild teleporters.\n+ Game menus including the inventory, loot, and pickpocketing pause the game. This interrupts immersion/pacing in favor of an easier difficulty.\n+ Non-universal difficulty setting, and the ability to change the difficulty on the fly. This adds too much flexibility to players where I think it should be the game's direction that should figure this out.\n+ UI is not good. Although not as bad as Skyrim's, font sizes are too large and spacing is bad, clearly compatible for consoles and TVs and not specialized to PCs and widscreen aspect ratios.\n+ Dedicated buttons for Attack, Block, and Cast. I prefer Skyrim's approach of left and right hand action buttons which depend on what it's equipped as. In addition to a unified simplicity, this enables dual wield playstyles of Weapon/Cast, Cast/Cast, and more. It also avoids stat sticks such as for mages who wear a shield and a dagger, two-handed, or bow for the enchant bonuses, but they only use the Cast button.\n+ No sprint.\n+ Grab button. I prefer Skyrim's approach of holding the Activate Button (E), which is intuitive and removes the need for yet another key.\n+ Horse is useless given you can move faster and manuever better.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [UESP Wiki](https://en.uesp.net)\n+ [r/oblivion](https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion)\n+ [Nexus Mods Oblivion modlist](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/47591). It's the most popular modlist, recommended on Reddit and by Predcaliber.\n+ [Oblivion start video guide by William Strife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLvb4Zwq4rA)\n\n__Mods.__ For my first playthrough, I used the following.\n\n+ __Core essentials.__ Stability (Oblivion Stutter Remover, Engine Bug Fixes, 4GB RAM Patcher, Unofficial Oblivion Patch, Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch, Unofficial Oblivion DLC Patches, Clean Up, Better Saves); scripting framework (OBSE, Pluggy); borderless support (Borderless Gaming); and all managed with Wrye Bash and BOSS.\n+ __Quality of life.__ Improved UI for PC and widescreen aspect ratios (Darnified UI, Darnified UI Config Addon); max attributes for leveling to avoid micromanagement (Max Attribute Level Up); keep enemy weapons in inventory and reduce save file sizes (Floating Weapons Fix). Initially, I did not use AULIAS (auto update leveled items and spells) as I wanted to experience the original progression system first; I added it later.\n+ After 30 hours into the game, I added the rest (majority) of Bevilex's mods: OBSE plugins (Blockhead, MenuQue), base texture packs (2), grasses, trees, and landscape (6), architectures and cities (1), oblivion world (1), weather and immersion (1), body, armors, and weapons (6), creatures and animals (7), diverse retextures and replacers (1), ENB and Oblivion Reloaded (2).\n\nI played the Game of the Year Deluxe Edition on Steam (PC). I remapped controls to be more like Skyrim (WASD for movement, Ctrl for Sneak, Space for Jump, E for Activate, F for Change View, R for Ready Weapon, Tab for Journal, F5 for Quick Save, T for Wait, Left Click for Attack, Right Click for Cast since my build doesn't Block, Middle Click for Auto Move). My total playtime is 39 hours according to Steam (as of 5/18/19). Progression-wise, I started by following [UESP's recommended early quests](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Quest_Timing) which includes completing the main quest up to Dagon Shrine and Arena up to last quest. Then Fighters Guild, Mages Guild, main quest, Thieves Guild. I occassionally used player.advskill, player.coc, tlc, and player.additem to force skill ups, teleport, and flying/clipping to avoid grindy parts. Note I deliberately postponed the main quest to motivate doing the other questlines; and left the Thieves and Dark Brotherhood for last in order to avoid collecting infamy points.\n\nOn my second playthrough (December 2021), I finished what I didn't get to during my first playthrough: Dark Brotherhood (only did half), Knights of the Nine, Shivering Isles. Others todo: max level with max skills; best-in-slot everything; all Daedric quests; all master training quests; all city and settlement quests; visiting all locations on the map.\n\n__Build.__ My first build is Destruction Mage. Race is Breton, birthsign is Mage, class is Mage, appearance is default. Use primarily Destruction and Restoration; Alteration for shields and opening locks; Illusion for utilities like Invisibility, Chameleon, and Charm to avoid speechcraft; Mysticism for Soul Trap. Focus on Endurance early on, then Intellect, Willpower, and Speed. Enchantment is always [Fortify Magicka for sustaining high-damage spells](https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/3ay1t2/the_most_useful_armor_enchantment). Custom main spell is [X damage for 2 secs on Target with Frost and Shock, where X is set so spell is at most 1/5 my magicka pool](https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/7lobfm/best_destruction_spell). I deliberately ruled out the Combat specialization: melee as Elder Scrolls melee combat is bad. I also ruled out the Stealth specialization: Oblivion's archery is underpowered with low damage ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/2cmosn/how_can_you_play_a_stealthy_character_efficiently), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/4w6kyl/was_defaulting_to_sneak_archer_a_thing_in)), which can be made good but throws away all appreciating enemy mechanics anyways in favor of terrain; and melee is very challenging. Unlike Skyrim and like Morrowind, the Mage specialization has spellmaking and more utility spells. The other major mage build is High Elf Atronach. I avoided it because of zero regen which requires leveling up Alchemy for potions before every battle ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/5izz6j/some_tips_for_a_mage_build), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/79sgv6/returning_player_want_to_make_a_pure_mage/dp4v0x6)).

    "comments": "Elder Scrolls games excel most in their environment interaction, open worlds, build variety with a deep skills-based progression system, and quests across a main story, factions, and cities. Skyrim is the most streamlined Elder Scrolls game of its time. There are no significant innovations. Rather, there are improvements (or sometimes, just modernizations) with its first-person combat system; questing system with branching dialogue options; progression system with levels and skills that no longer use attribute bonuses; guilds/factions; diseases like vampirism and lycanthropy; viable builds across melee, stealth, and spells; crime; crafting; lore; and music. Skyrim also features one of the best modding communities of all time.\n\nFlaw-wise and common to all Elder Scrolls games, the first-person melee and magic combat is mediocre; many designs like dungeons and inns are only servicable and not stellar, particularly reusing assets and being fairly generic in linearity and aesthetic; a significant amount of bugs; a mediocre main quest; and an occasionally tedious menu navigation/UI. Unique to Skyrim, many RPG elements are too streamlined---including attributes (removed altogether), weapon conditions, spell variety, guilds, and dialogue options. In addition, outside environments aren't especially unique across their woodland, mountain, and snow terrain.\n\n__Story.__ Standalone, I think Skyrim lore like all of Elder Scrolls is mediocre. Cities are microcosms of their actual size and depth; NPC AI limitations are clear after a few hours with their neutral manequine-like expressions, dialogue, fighting, and pathing; and many more. With that said, I think its ability to enable a nonlinear pacing, and to do so well, speaks volumes for its story in the video game medium where paths branch and substories fork according to player decisions. Relatively speaking, the NPC AI is also among the better of video games.\n\nWhat I find most disappointing about the questlines is that they don't intersect, making them all feel like isolated games with no world impact. In Morrowind, for example, the Thieves Guild questline would have you end up stealing from the Fighters Guild guildmaster in which you get all the endgame Fighers Guild loot without having to actually be in it. Questlines would more often lock you out of others. In addition, essential NPCs can die, completely locking you out of a main quest.\n\nI did like certain questlines in Skyrim: for example, Dawnguard involves vampire attacks across the region, vampire-themed areas, and Serana and her family relationship; the Dark Brotherhood has always been good in Elder Scrolls for having quests that interact with NPCs and towns, and the quest this time involves a mad jester with a perverse relationship with the Night Mother; and Thieves' Guild which involves non-lethal persuasions via sneaking, pickpocketing, lockpicking, and more. Even with these however, the biggest flaw in Skyrimâs plot remains. Namely, every quest chain revolves around the player being a chosen one, and solving some grand dilemma. I much prefer Morrowind's route of simply rising in ranks via routine activities. Let guilds act like guilds, not glorified questlines.\n\n__Gameplay.__ I love the various common Elder Scrolls mechanics: environment interaction of stealing/pickpocketing and killing NPCs; ingame time with NPC behavior; diseases like vampirism and werewolf; crime system of tresspassing, theft, murder, bounties, witnesses, dragging bodies, bribes, and jail; dialogue of persuasion, threat, and bribes; leveling via dialogue; NPC friendship. I also like the companionship mechanics: house, follower, marriage, adoption. Unlike other RPGs where magic MP serves like another HP, Skyrim's MP bar replenishes fast and more similar to the endurance bar. Think that's an interesting choice.\n\nFollowers are a fun mechanic but mediocrely executed. Their pathing is especially bad (common among all NPCs). I constantly have to look behind to make sure they're not stuck, I have to manage their inventory and their auto-equip system, they ruin sneak attacks, and they often trigger dungeon traps.\n\nSkyrim's UI is in need of improvements. The UI with clicking via mouse and keyboard compete to select an option, which makes for unintuitive behavior. The quest log is unstructured and hard to follow, especially the miscellaneous category. The inventory system is clunky for PC. SkyUI with its color-coding and column-format is essential for even a first playthrough.\n\n__Combat.__ Elder Scrolls combat is redundant and clunky. \"Wack it until it dies.\" It's clear Skyrim's combat is not as refined as more dense action RPGs which require a mastery of weak/strong attacks each with different striking motions (e.g., thrust, vertical, horizontal, diagonal); a dodge mechanic; enemy attacks that don't immediately track your strafes; enemy attack variety in their mechanics; landed hits don't feel weighty, e.g., enemies not always reacting to blows; and anything else in fight mechanics beyond spongy enemy HP and spamming melee attacks (c.f., Chivalry). In addition, Skyrim's combat often requires you to go in menu to, e.g., drink healing potions; this ruins pacing. Take dragon fights for example. The moveset is tail stomp, fly around, dragon blast. There's little tactic involved.\n\nSee the combat mods below for what an improved Elder Scrolls combat system could look like. See also reddit posts [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/7qhwqq/fixing_skyrims_combat_system_a_not_so/) and [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/8l24ol/guide_sse_guide_to_all_the_various_combat_mods/). Note installing these mods won't fix Skyrim. The issues are fundamental, and fixes would require widespread changes for balance across for example enemy animations, attacks, locations/patrols, and damage scaling. For example, Sekiro and Chivalry-style parry sytems with complex maneuvers of attacks and defenses.\n\n__Aesthetics/Sound.__ The art direction is good but not stellar. Textures and characters can be a bit blocky. More blatantly, asset reuse can be a huge problem as aesthetically many dungeons and buildings look all too much the same---it seems to stretch out the game in quantity of content rather than quality. That said, I'm still pleasantly surprised by the level of depth max settings can give you for a 2011 game. I do love the orchestral soundtracks. They suit the atmosphere really well. The best zone by far is Apocrypha: lovely atmosphere, interesting design closer to a curated action-adventure, unique enemies albeit few.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Minimalistic HUD.\n+ New to Skyrim, I appreciate the smithing skill to craft your own equipment. I never really took advantage of it though as I never found a way to integrate it into my leveling experience. It is necessary for best-in-slot gear at the end though, so there's at least some incentive to have it.\n+ New to Skyrim, I appreciate the smithing skilll\n+ Seamless integration of quest-finding and quest rewards through dialogue options (e.g., no artificial markers over a questgiver's head, or color outlines). Same goes for services like blacksmiths, lumber mills, houses, and inns.\n+ No distinct class options, only race. Builds are varied through stat and perk choices. In fact, I wish they automated even further to be build-variable: namely, remove any universal level and explicit stat allocation to health, stamina, and magicka. This would make it truly Elder Scrolls-core in specific skills over the use of classic RPG stats.\n+ If it weren't for console hacking and saves, having followers and NPCs die (and with exceptions you have to know about) is inconvenient. The mechanic is interesting theoretically, especially with the permanence. Fortunately there are enough NPCs and followers that having a few die in a world is not a game-changer. Dragon and vampire attacks in a city also only happen in your vicinity, so it's easy to reload an autosave upon a quicktravel.\n+ You go to innkeepers to hear rumors. I like this approach of Morrowind and Oblivion's approach of every NPC having a Rumors option. This feels more immersive in that the first thing you do in arriving at a city is sleeping for the skill bonus and also chatting it up to get local quests.\n+ Although the reward is a bit too game-y, becoming Thane of each city is a fun incentive to try complete each cities' core quests.\n+ Combat finishing moves (like Fallout) are fun to watch although weird in animations.\n+ Dialogue volume is proximity-based.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ No armor/weapon durability.\n+ Map as fog-of-war in dungeons. I prefer Dark Souls' no map for the immersion, but this is a very different game with its own direction. I don't know how I feel about this specific choice in the full context of Elder Scrolls.\n+ Radiant questing system. It's more dynamic but also harder to track.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Bugs. So many bugs. I've had to reload a save file more than a few times because I'd get stuck, a follower would get stuck, I'd lose all my followers following me, quests would halt (particularly in Alduin's Wall and Paarthunax), and many more.\n+ Fast travel, the same flaw as Oblivion.\n+ Spell variety is largely neutered over Morrowind and Oblivion. Clothing has also been made obselete over Light or Heavy Armor for any class. Unlike Oblivion's spell effectiveness mechanic, there is no advantage with the exception of -flesh spells with a perk (https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/6qujca/what_are_the_benefits_of_using_robes_over_light/dl0b24d/).\n+ I prefer Morrowind's (and maybe this includes Oblivion?) dialogue depth. Instead of just a Persuade, Intimidate, and Bribe option, Morrowind has Admire, Intimidate, Taunt, and Bribe under multiple gold options.\n+ Enemy scaling. I don't think dragons should be killable at low levels. This is one of the issues with level scaling, where I think it would be more of an accomplishment if it was delayed to later in the game. Certain areas should be barred to later levels.\n+ Non-universal difficulty setting, and the ability to change the difficulty on the fly (same as Oblivion).\n+ Cities and many houses have a loading screen and are not open-world like Morrowind.\n+ You can join all guilds simultaneously. It's a ridiculous fantasy that a stranger can walk into each guild and become the leader of all of them through a series of quests. A two-handed melee can be leader of the Mage's guild for crying out loud. Morrowind restricted to one and that forced you to choose according to the class fantasy you're specializing as. There's also no ranks in a guild, which makes guilds feel closer to quest chains than as true membership with any perks or bonuses.\n+ Weapon variety. I would've liked to see polearms and stabbing weapons.\n+ Dialogue can cut off abruptly or repeat, which ruins the immersive experience as it feels clunky. Similarly, two NPCs can say their dialogue line at the same time.\n+ The lore of being a special Dragonborn, and the gameplay mechanic of Dragon Shouts. This uniquifies the builds when one of Elder Scrolls' core strengths is the significant build variety, most with class fantasies that have nothing to do with dragon abilities.\n+ Opening an instance and having some NPC face stare at you. It stuns me everytime.\n+ The grind to enable Thieve Guilds' last quest for Guild master is unreal: 25 radiant quests, and within specific cities; then 125 for full upgrade. The main questlines for the other factions are nowhere this grindy.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/\n+ https://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page\n+ https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition\n+ https://www.loverslab.com/forum/72-skyrim-special-edition/\n+ skyrim guides by william strife | https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn7CSjAPE5FNg4YaQD8oazGSyIbRV7nUx\n+ quest guide | https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Quest_Timing\n+ Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim comparison | https://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/2gat22/a_rational_analysis_morrowind_vs_oblivion_vs/\n+ Belmont Boy's Ultimate Skyrim playthrough (hugely modded Skyrim) | https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1voIHcG_XV6smOhCfJX-gbdf9ihw8lb0\n\nThis entry includes all three DLCs: Dawnguard, Hearthfire, Dragonborn.\n\n__Mods.__ For my first playthrough, I only used core essentials in order to appreciate the original experience: Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch which fixes bugs; SKSE which is a prerequisite for SSE Engine Fixes; SSE Engine Fixes which re-enables Steam achievments; Complete Widescreen Fix which provides 21:9 support; direct edit of Skyrim.ini with bAlwaysActive=1 to have a cursor and keep the game active while tabbed out; and all managed with Mod Organizer 2. Quality-of-life mods I got are: Run for Your Lives to prevent quest-giving NPCs to die from vampires and dragons (the most common way for NPCs to die); and SkyUI which makes the inventory more PC-friendly than console-friendly (otherwise managing item burden via value/weight; left/right hand combos is tedious; buffs aren't visible on HUD so you can't tell, e.g., if a summon's duration is ending soon).\n\nAfter 50 hours playtime within my first playthrough (completing all factions, and just about to start main quest), I added quality of life mods and graphics mods for a grand total of 40 mods:\n\n+ __Quality of life mods.__ A Quality World Map for an improved map; Immersive HUD for a more minimal HUD.\n+ __Aesthetics mods.__ Audio (SSE High Quality Music); texture packs (12 mods: Static Mesh Improvement Mod; Ruins Clutter Improved; Enhanced Textures Detail; Skyrim Realistic Overhaul; NobleSkyrimMod HD-2K; Solstheim Landscape Overhaul HD; Forgotten Vale HD Ice Textures; HD Lava for Dawnguard; Just Ice; Soul Cairn HD; Sovngarde HD); weather and sky (4 mods: Obsidian Weathers, Ethereal Clouds; Skyrim Textures Redone - Enhanced Night Sky; Smooth Sky Mesh); grass, trees, and mountains (5 mods: Red Rocks 4k; Skyrim 3D Trees and Plants; Every Tree 3D Different; Verdant; Skyrim 3D Landscapes); lighting, water, and special effects (3 mods: Enhanced Lights and FX; Unofficial ELFX - SMIM FPS Patch; Realistic Water Two); ENB which is most dramatic improvement in changing the rendering engine (Intrigued ENB with Stronger DOF; see [ENB comparison video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPmgxuPK8aw)). For minimalism, I did not touch mods specific to: dungeons; LOD files; one item; weapons; armor; or NPC, player, or monster appearances. If I wanted a super-aesthetic experience, see Ultimate Skyrim. There's no way I could do enough research that a mod pack expert could do.

Enemy mechanics: improved enemy AI, lethality, injuries, poise, stamina costs, timed blocking, locational damage (Ultimate Combat, Wildcat, Skyrim Revamped - Complete Enemy Overhaul); enemies' attack aim don't perfectly autotrack (Mortal Enemies). Systems: balanced perk system and new mechanics (Ordinator); Witcher's toxicity to discourage potion spamming (Chasing the Dragon). \n+ __Realism mods.__ See [MxR Mods' video](https://youtu.be/uO85lzzh1P0) and [another]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TmydPvNpk4).

I first played the game on 10/1/12. However, I never made more than an hour's progress, ending in the middle of the Golden Claw quest. My total playtime is 58 hours according to Steam (as of 5/12/19). Progression-wise, I did the main quest in Whiterun and prioritized quests that can lock out via NPC deaths: Thane of Falkreath, Dawnguard DLC, Thane of Hjaalmarch. I then completed College of Winterhold, Companions, Dark Brotherhood, Thane of Riften, Thieves Guild, the main quest, and the Dragonborn DLC. I deliberately postponed the main quest to motivate me to complete the other sidequests; Imperial Legion until after main quest for the Season Unending quest; and Dragonborn until after the main quest for lore and unique dialogue. Things I did not do: Imperial Legion questline; level 100 everything; best-in-slot everything including followers; Divine quests; Daedric quests; all Thanes; all quests in all cities; optional faction quests; all bounty quests; all dungeon quests; all word walls; all collectibles (https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:100%25_Completion).\n\nMy first build is a Conjuration Warrior (\"Bound Weapon Necromancer\", \"Death Knight\", \"Undead Rogue\"), inspired by Solo Leveling. Race is Nord with the old man preset. Lover Stone. Serana and Berlyna Maryon as followers (two with the permanent trick in UESP's Touching the Sky quest). Quest-wise, I chose for the lore/perks: Empire, Battle-Born, Forsworn, and Dawnguard. Stat ratio is 7:2:1 health:magicka:stamina. Skills are Two-Handed, Light Armor, and Conjuration; and secondary in Archery, Restoration (no perks, just spells), and Smithing. I hold my own as a offensive melee DPS with only bound (conjured) weapons: a two-hander and occasional bow. I can also [summon an undead army: 2 Thralls and their 2 Frost Atronachs, Brelyna Maryon and her Storm Atronach, Serana and her Reanimated Corpse, Shadowmere, and Durnhevier via shouting](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/3f1nag/i_want_to_try_a_summoner_build/ctkg8o6/). The build is designed with inspiration from Dark Souls, Solo Leveling, and to pack as many unique/best Skyrim mechanics in one build. In particular:\n\n+ Weapon-wise, I like two-handed which Iâve been fond of since Dark Souls.\n+ Armor-wise, I chose light armor for the class fantasy of fast but squishy: no movement penalties, quieter footsteps, minimal equip burden, low armor rating. Meta-wise, it also seems optimal over Heavy Armor at both early and endgame (https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/3uiziy/why_do_most_people_like_light_armor_over_heavy/cxf9s2o/). That said, I think Skyrim most stands out aesthetics-wise in its heavy armor (for example, the iconic Daedric Armor); the only exceptions in my opinion are Nightingale Set and Vampire Set. By endgame, I played Fashion Scrolls by going full Vampire (Royal) Set, Serana with full Nightingale, and Brelyna with full Ebony.\n+ For magic schools, Elder Scrolls most stands out from other games via its illusionism and conjuration. Every RPG has an elemental mage, but illusion and conjuration magic are always more creative.\n+ Vampirism and lycanthropy are uniquely Elder Scrolls but I won't play them this playthrough (weakness to sunlight, killing NPCs permanently, and automatic NPC hostility are cool but inconvenient).\n\nOther builds I really like: Stealth Archer, Illusion Thief/Assassin Vampire, Paladin, Destruction Mage, Werewolf.",

    "comments": "MMOs (and WoW especially) are most unique in video games for their social community aspects with elements like voice chat, guilds, and guild vs guild competition; and the feeling of grind progressions across gear and miscellanea side missions like professions---all with lasting effects (once you hit a grind tier, never will you have to do it again for that character). Neither of these aspects exist in modern games. Grind is lambasted these days as popular modern games make casual gaming easier with only single-game-lasting effects: multiplayer FPS since forever, MOBAs since 2012, and battle royales since 2015. WoW really canonicalized the gear grind at endgame with core PvE and PvP distinctions, and distinguished itself from even future MMOs by tying it all back to the community---something few MMOs accomplished.\n\nstrengths\n+ pre-modern wow with social aspects to quest together, form guilds, find pick-up groups, and many more\n+ massive player base and community websites\n+ pve content | 5, 10, 25, and 40-man raids\n+ pvp content | battlegrounds, arenas, dueling system, faction city raids\n+ custom ui\n+ achievements\n+ economy\n+ multiple specializations\n+ expansive overworld with seamless loading screens\n+ decent lore\n+ playable factions, races, and reptutations\n+ macros\n+ linkable items/quests/etc.\n+ dungeon, pvp, etc. finder interfaces\n + World events. It really set the precedent to a moving universe.\n\nflaws\n+ modern era wow with its reduction of rpg elements and systems like Group Finder; c.f., Black Desert Online\n+ tab and focus targeting system; c.f., Black Desert Online, Elder Scrolls Online\n+ combat as abilities, cooldowns, and rotation system; c.f., Black Desert Online, Guild Wars 2\n+ endgame is a constant grind for better gear (cf League of Legends for ranked endgame with only cosmetic upgrades)\n+ dailies, which obligates regular short-session playthroughs rather than intense long playthroughs (e.g., just on weekends)\n+ content becomes outdated (e.g., gear, low level zones, warlords of draenor garrisons, legion artifacts)\n+ poor balance during leveling between zone progression, dungeons, and pvp. by the time you hit 20% of new zones, you're already max level and overleved for the remaining content.\n+ lack of solo rated queue as arenas are just not the right platform for top tier PvP (cf League of Legends). It's often too much effort to depend on meta for team compositions as well as players to assemble 2, 3, or 5 for rated arena, or 10 for rated battleground. But I can appreciate why vanilla WoW didn't have it in, in favor of balance and more socializing.\n+ bad default interface (cf Guild Wars 2)\n+ basic personalization, e.g., transmogification\n\nI started playing on a private server for 1-2 years (WowCrack). Boy are these my fondest memories with both a guild on Horde (Serenity) and a guild on Alliance (Faith). I remember doing raids, hacking, dueling, idling my time with friends while sitting at Thunderbluff, and farming dungeons for miscellaneous trinkets. I think I had around 45 days of /played time on my BE rogue alone, forget about my Tauren Warrior Sometimes, Undead Priest Neverr, and Human Female Rogue Sekyruu. Serenity guild (No Mercy shortly beforehand) and Faith alliance guild. Certain personalities like Marco the Warrior, Eidos the guildmaster and BE Warlock, Katara the rogue and priest, that high pitched voice gnome warrior, Dozer (an Undead Warrior tank and DPS), Andrew (warrior, then death knight). Asana(?) my crush on a human female Druid and mage (?). He/she was brilliantly intelligent and coy, and remained sexually and gender ambiguous.I have fond memories of playing on the private server without any access to scripted monsters or any fights. So I deeply appreciate all the programming that goes into WoW. Even to this day I smile at how much they have evolved.\n\nDo I really not have my WoW screenshots anywhere? That's a damn shame.\n\nAt its core, what I enjoyed about World of Warcraft was the mix of the following elements:\n\n+ If you enjoy the lore and questing, you're guaranteed to get the better game from RPGs. For me: I like lore, but I enjoy my JRPGs and films for this instead.\n+ If you enjoy the social aspect with a community and PvE raid progression, there is no alternative. For me: As of 2018, I can't stand the online playerbase community though (they're too immature, lack a proper education, and generally refer to low derivative discourse that is often repetitive).\n+ If you enjoy PvP, it all depends on the style you want, e.g., shooters for quick reaction, real time strategy for high level thinking. For me: I'm not really a competitive PvP player anymore, but I do enjoy queuing up once in a while and steamrolling via stealth, burst damage, and well-timed usage of crowd control. I haven't found the right slot to fill this hole other than cycling across video games as I continue to play them all and new ones get released.\n+ If you enjoy farming for that last piece of optimization, you should take a step back and think about where you might more productively enjoy those optimizations for life in general (e.g., your career, other hobbies). For me: I already apply it to my career and other hobbies.\n\nConclusion: See above. It only makes sense to visit MMOs during an exciting release of new content, to both experience the hype and the game to better understand the genre over history overall. No MMO (or game for that matter) will be a constant that I will semiregularly visit and play as a casual. My personal style better fits playing games at obsessive, short intervals until I learned all there is and I can do a hard stop.\n\n## The Burning Crusade (2008-2009)\n\nBurning Crusade is by far the best expansion, and perhaps the best expansion in video game hiustory. It further formalized PvE as 10/25-man raids and PvP with arena and battlegrounds, and began the WoW esport scene. Blood elf and Draenor races are meh. The Burning Crusade's new continent and raids are amazing though---I loved them, including the new patch Sunwell's dungeons and raids. I also loved new additions like Jewelcrafting with socketed gem gear and guild banks.\n\n__10-man and 25-man raids__. Love the fundamental setup.\n\n__Arena.__ Yes.\n\n__Daily quests.__ Very controversial particularly with the way modern WoW has taken this extreme. I can appreciate what Ion Hazzikostas says about it which is that it introduced structure to questing that wasn't done before, where previously you would run to X zone, kill X mobs, and more. It made questing part of the endgame content rather than something purely for leveling.\n\n__Flying.__ Yes and no. I love the idea and greatly enjoy flying. But it also forces map design to be so much larger. The 5000 gold barrier for fast flying (270%) is also super hard; I never even got it when I played hardcore during high school. I only had the level before. It's hard to tell but I may actually have preferred a WoW where all maps were intelligently designed to be small and more cohesive. It's basically impossible to not fly in maps now.\n\n## Wrath of the Lich King (2009-10)\n\nI have somewhat fond memories of when I first played (the legit version of) the game. I farmed dailies in Wrath of the Lich King, did the Wintegrasp world pvp weekly, and did raid / dungeon heroic weeklies for the loot. Then I even did 2v2 rated arena. Boy that all sucked quite a bit of my time.. The expansion of dailies as a system forcing you to spend your time is really really bad. It makes it difficult for casuals to really enjoy the game.\n\n__Raid difficulties of normal and heroic.__ I didn't like this scaling system, and modern WoW just took it to the extreme with infinite scaling Mythic+ dungeons and Mythic raids only top guilds can complete.\n\n__Achievements.__ This is excellent. The best way to keep track of things.\n\n__World PvP.__ I love Wintergrasp! At least, when it was active.\n\nNew class (death knight), profession (inscripting), and PvP zones are all meh. The map and Dalaran as my idle city of choice over Shattrath from TBC is great (although in TBC I mostly stayed in Thunderbluff); it's better to have the hub be a smaller city like Dalaran to concentrate players. The first time of vehicular combat is done very well with Wintergrasp, WotLK introduced only sparse amounts of mini-game style combat. It only went worse in modern WoW when too many world quests would have you not even interacting with your classic mechanics to finish them.\n\n__Championing.__ I liked the \"Championing\" idea (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Championing) introduced in Wrath of the Lich King, where you can buy tabards at Friendly status and then proceed to farm to Exalted via dungeons rather than obscure dailies. It's a shame you can't farm this way for Warlords of Draenor factions. It looks like Cataclysm was the last to do this; Warlords of Draenor stopped.\n\n## On the Modern WoW (From late WoTLK/Cataclysm and Beyond)\n\nOver the years, WoW streamlined. And I do think this is a better choice both for the industry (the larger audience is the causal gemers) as well as for the longevity of WoW (personally, I'm no longer ever going to be a hardcore gamer willing to do, e.g., dailies). However, it remove many core RPG elements: RPGs tend not to have this minimalism and streamlined feeling.\n\nIn general, I miss RPG elements:\n\n+ Unique class mechanics that play to their class fantasy (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/9jhxs0/remember_the_good_times_of_character/e6s8by2/). Every class has the basics: main attack, finishing move, CC, heal, interrupt. To be a true RPG, each class should really offer unique elements. I don't understand what my Rogue is doing with a gunshot proc, gunshot attack, and a self-heal. And I'm surprised hunters apparently have a Sprint. (Possibly related: I remember when Sprint had a 5m cooldown and Blade Furry was 2m instead of 30s. Boy did those require you to think about cooldowns more wisely.)\n+ Single worlds, with a lack of phasing, cross realm zones, and scenarios. This encouraged more social interaction and world events. That said, I do like the cinematics and customization that phasing offers, I wish the two were a bit more seamless, like SWTOR did. Phasing in the open world removes identity from known players. Everyone in a city you will never know as they're effectively NPCs. With non-phased realms, you would always see the same people: the best enchanters hanging out in a city, the best guilds and geared players in a realm, duel partners. Imagine single-realm BGs where your reputation is on the line for AFKing.\n+ No LFR channel. For endgame dungeons, this encourages social interactions from guild chat and pick-up-groups from the active LFG chat channel. Parties would naturally form in world encounters and you may find friends while leveling with a stranger together.\n+ visiting a class trainer to respec and learn all the spells, including ranks. And the idea of having them be unlocked via dungeon drops.\n+ Factions that actually matter (e.g., do not share auction house and are cross-realm)\n+ Gold where item purchases actually felt weighty (epic flying was an echievement evn I couldn't get as a WoW rogue in Wrath of the Lich King, and I played 45-60 days /played; rewards overall are just that much more meaningful, something that would see yourself spending your teens/20s on and which you could never see that happening in BFA)\n+ World pvp ganking and actual fights (iconic vanilla PvP videos often did world PvP instead of battlegrounds). You now have to turn on a flag in your nameplate to fight Alliance / Horde in the world (and they have to too). Without world PvP, there really is no significance to choosing a faction any longerâit's really just choosing a subpopulation you get to play with. Certainly this means no more raiding Stormwind or Orgrimmar!\n+ Best in slot gear and PvP vendors. The RNG on warforged items makes it impossible to achieve BiS gear. This is a holy grail in terms of RPG elements, and is a concrete goal you can shoot for in getting a specific gear set. RNG is simply limited to whether a boss drops the item, and if you win the roll. Here, you must a,sk deal with variations in ilevel, which primary trait, and ghe individual abilities in the case of Azerite armor.\n+ gear stats that actually vary a lot across items (e.g., weapon speed) and required more though than the scalar item level\n+ talent tree\n+ Everything is on the global cooldown timer now. It feels like I'm just relying on autoattack, the occasional moving maneuver, and the economy of one ability per second, rather than the ability to reallt burst down by spamming a set of abilities within one global cooldown tick. It's yet another example of the new streamlined WoW vision.\n+ Consumable items aside from food (e.g., elixirs, stat boosting buffs) aren't used anymore because of the easier difficulty. Natual regeneration of HP/MP is so much faster, and the loss of HP to kill one mob is so much less. Dungeons and elite areas previously required crowd control, and I would die more often to fight a really tough quest boss.\n+ Trinket ring, engineering, and consumables for utility.\n+ No WoW token for pay-to-win.\n+ profession choices that actually matter\n+ Glyphs, which added further depth to weapon customizability, were removed in Legion.\n+ Gem sockets were added in The Burning Crusade but moved to be prismatic sockets (accepts any gem) in Warlords of Draenor and made items with gem sockets uncommon for most items.\n+ enchants\n+ First Aid moved from a secondary profession to be part of Tailoring in Battle for Azeroth. This effectively removed the complexity healing consumable in combat (and a major in-game mechanic to motivate leveling up a secondary profession).\n+ 25-man raids giving highest item levels, not 5-man mythic+ dungeon alternatives like BFA.\n+ having loot systems via Need and Master Loot rather than personal loot\n+ Lack of most portals, forcing all party members to actually travel to the dungeon instance instead of instant-teleporting from summons.\n+ PvP rank titles (e.g., seargeant) that actually mattered\n+ GMs that actually fucked around in the world and didn't just play as customer support\n+ epic players that became wow employees like ion hazzikostas\n+ singular focus on one character rather than incentivizing alts\n+ Weapon mastery skills I'm ambivalent about. They seem half-hearted in grinding. They should be more complex or just removed. I do like the memory of being a Rogue and having to go to Thunderbluff to get the Mace skill and explicitly grind it. It could push in that direction where it incentivizes something new, and not just more time to level up.\n+ Items in inventory, such as mining pick, enchanting rod, fishing pole, Rogue poisons to buy and then craft, hunter ammo. Other complexitise include shaman totems, secondary weapons, and lockpicking.\n+ Inspect having a limited 10m range. That way, it's obvious to tell whl's mirin, I like the subtle social cue of everyone gathering around someone in Orgrimmar decked in epic gear.\n\nExamples of new failed systems in modern WoW: phasing and sharding; Dungeon Finder; Titanforging and Warforging; Transmogrification; War mode.\n\nWithout these RPG elements, the streamlining feels less like an immersive RPG and more like a modern social game like League of Legends (indeed, that was what the revised talent tree reminds me of). The Wow gampedia wiki on the evolution is interesting (https://wow.gamepedia.com/World_of_Warcraft_evolution_guide).\n\nAsmongold's reaction video to this post is also a good summary of the problems since simplifications in Cataclysm.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/9o28vr/the_state_of_battle_for_azeroth_asmongold/\n\nHe rants a bit to needless degrees. But I especially like the point about modern WoW no longer having things you can strive for. For end-game players, they're more interested in optimizing their raider.io score and parses from Warcraft logs than looking to optimize their \"non-best in slot\" gear. PvP is still in a decent place, because there's concrete progression via Conquest points to get the next gear upgrade (albeit a very specific gear item); Badge of Honors received even after losses/RNG from wins so you can purchase transmogs from old gear (but note: no PvP vendors); and precise PvP ratings to determine your rank.\n\n## Cataclysm (12/2016-12/2016)\n\nI zoomed through these when playing again. I didn't really enough time to study its content. I do like the idea of overhauling the classic maps rather than adding yet another zone to explore. I also like the ambition in removing certain portals to force exploration. E.g., a portal from Dalaran is only to Orgrimmar---you have to venture to other zones manually.\n\nThank you Patch 3.3.0 in Wrath of the Lich King for introducing the Dungeon Finder! (was this after I left the game?) This makes getting arbitrary dungeons SO SO much easier than waiting outside the portal of a specific dungeon and spamming LFG in chat. It's a natural idea building on Battleground always being queueable. It's funny how dead the chat channel becomes after this. There's basically no point to having per-Zone chat channels anymore; I remember really only using it during my TBC expansion times by having miscellaneous chats while leveling. I also miss partying with random people in the world map to complete a batch of quests together. Now it seems more like it's a solo activity.\n\n__Adventure Guide.__ To me, this is bloatware. It will never be as good as following Wowhead or WoWpedia. Why introduce something like this when third-party systems already solved this?\n\n__Transmogrification.__ I actually don't like this system. I prefer having iconic gear that people can identify. There's a status to them. If you care about Fashion, I think WoW should have gone the Dark Souls route of enabling Fashion Souls where you're at an explicit gear disadvantage, but ideally that disadvantage isn't that bad compared to just executing mechanics. Look at the icons that defined Tiers (I remember being envious of Rogue Tier 1 and 2's artwork; and wearing T4-6 and Sunwell, and Season 5/6 Deadly and Furious Gladiator). They're only good for that era; I wouldn't want to see those again unless everything else such as mechanics are also the same.\n\n## Mists of Panderia (12/2016-12/2016)\n\nIn general, I zoomed through these when playing again. I didn't have enough time to study its content.\n\n__Pet battle system.__. It's interesting. I need time to collect my thoughts.\n\n__Scenarios__. They're interesting. I need time to collect my thoughts.\n\nMonk, Pandaria map, Pandaren race, PvP zones, PvE zones are meh.\n\n## Warlords of Draenor (09/2018-10/2018)\n\nWarlords of Draenor represents a significant departure in the vision for WoW, since the peak of Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King, followed by the steep decline in activity in Mists of Pandaria. I don't like the new vision.\n\n__Story progression.__ I greatly enjoyed leveling based on the idea of \"story progression\". In general, in WoW I'm always so cluttered with tons of quests that I can comprehensively go through one leveling zone's quests and be so overleveled that I start needing to skip other zones. What I'd prefer is a greater density of quest quality by having fewer main quests per map. It seems like this is the case if you only follow the \"Story Progression\" quests per map. (I started doing this in Warlords of Draenor of level 90 and above.)\n\nThe quest map that's default is also good enough to not require another addon. I especially like the pattern of only getting flying after you complete many of the achievements in the map.\n\nApparently for leveling, it's recommended you do quests as you'll have to finish these stories anyways. Dungeons only really give you achievements for completing on the first time, and battlegrounds give you honor points. Battleground are much easier to ground at the endgame rather than the many more items to grind out during questing. However, you should do dungeons now to get the achivement for the first time, unless you think you can solo them at a higher level or can wait for timewalking dungeons. This is likely the case for all expansions except the last on heroic. It's not too big a deal beacuse you wouldn't be able to do many of the boss-specific achievements or Mythic. So you'll need a team in any case to farm old expansion achievements.\n\n__Timewalking dungeons.__ Lets you visit a lot of the classic dungeons including vanilla, The Burning Crusade, etc. This is great!\n\n__Unified Group Finder for dungeons, raids, PvP, battlegrounds, etc.__ Makes it so much cleaner. Thank you. Now if only they did the same for collectibles (not just mounts, pets, appearance as in the current panel, but also Reputation and Achievements).\n\n__Garrisons.__ I don't like it. It encourages solo activity where everyone holes up at their base. It also forces you to track yet another feature. It's nice that you get certain features unique to yourself, and which are permanent in the zone. But I wish it was done in a way that didn't require constant monitoring. It looks like no one at endgame or post-Warlords of Draenor even uses their Garrison aside from idle farming of gold (which isn't much).\n\nNew focus on item level (since which expansion?). It makes things easier as a way to define each person. ased on their gear level. But it also makes me not really attention to my stats when selecting gear during leveling. I hole thats not the case at the endgame, when ideally everyone has same item level but wih minor stats variations.\n\nTalent and specs are redesigned (since when?). This is super nice. This makes it much easier than not having to visit a class trainer to respec.\n\nThe quests make it much nicer to follow, and without the need flr an external addon. (And it's officially guaranteed to be accurate.)\n\nThe stat simplifications in Warlods of Draenor are great.\n\nI like Warlords of Draenor's newly introduced Adventure panel, which provides some guidance on what to do next. But there's already so panels and things to keep track of that things remain daunting. Rather than introduce a panel that points the way, do more like the stat simplifications by cutting the fat.\n\n__Pay to win via WoW Token.__ Legitimized gold-purchasing. This was bad.\n\n## Legion (09/2018-10/2018)\n\n__Class Halls.__ I don't like Garrisons, and I don't like this. It's great that they're at least still inside Dalaran, and they focus on longer missions and fewer followers. However, this mobile game idling shit doesn't fit into an MMO. It's forced activity.\n\n__Artifacts.__ I don't like it. I much prefer RPG drops.\n\n__World quests.__ Apparently a replacement to dailies. I like that they push the playerbase to engage in the world, even if it's only the expansion's part of the world. I don't like that they're dailies though; maybe weeklies would be a little less pressure for the casual user (e.g., imagine doing this on weekdays for someone with a career).\n\n__PvP Brawls.__ I like them as a weekly engagement similar to Brawls in Hearthstone.\n\n__I love the voice acting dialogues in Legion.__ Lets you stay in control while the scene goes on. This is way better than cutscenes.\n\n__Honor system.__ I like the overhaul, simplifying the need for PvP-only gear.\n\nBroken Isle continent. I like the idea of zone scaling, so all zones remain relevant. However, I don't like the ideaolf having to choose the order I go in. I prefer a linear route, and ideally experiencing the densest pack of all For zone order I followed https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/5pgqmh/what_is_the_best_legion_zone_to_go_first_second/.\n\nNew class (Legion Hunter), PvP zones, PvE zones are meh.\n\nI'm a big fan of the Legion mobile app which lets you manage your class hall missions on your phone. It's a natural extension of the Armory mobile app. (I can see reasons for why and why not they should have continued the mobile Auction app.) I actually wish there weren't such resources to have to maintain in WoW though. It's a forced way of encouraging active usage, like a mobile game. It's also a shame this doesn't let you manage older content such as Garrisons; and as of the Battle for Azeroth expansion it lets you monitor the new missions table and no longer Class Halls. There should be no reason why, and it would only encourage non-deprecation of previous content features.\n\nThe main professions seem completely useless for endgame. Wrath had each profession offer one unique advantage (e.g., an enchant, or a specific armor with slightly better stats) and all of which were roughly equal. Here there is zero advantage to any professionsâfor crafting, all better items are found elsewhere; and for gathering, it is only useful for farming gold.\n\n## Battle for Azeroth (09/2018-10/2018)\n\n\"Can someone tell me what the selling point of this expansion is? Warfronts? Azerite gear? Island Expeditions? They've all flopped.\" (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/9nhus0/i_have_lost_all_faith_in_ion_hazzikostas_as_game/) It seriously plays like Legion 2.0 with nothing groundbreaking. Some improved tweaks to the system (e.g., professions, war mode). I liked this review of Battle for\nAzeroth. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLURznzDU-c\n\n__Azerite armor.__ Replacement for Artifact weapons. But now.. armor. In addition, there are now new mission tables which just replace Legion's Class Hall and which replaced Warlords of Draenor's Garrisons. Reputation controls your item level, and which unlocks abilities in your gear.. ugh. Please go back to item drops!\n\nLegion artifacts are no longer used in Battle for Azeroth. With Azerite Armor, it's like Garrisons being replaced with Class Halls. That's stupid.\n\n__Warfronts.__ Bad. The weekly changes are a nice way of having cyclical, changing content. The PvE raids aren't that interesting thoughâthey seem like a weird combination of PvE and MOBA games. I'm of the opinion that they should distill their core mechanics rather than add a zillon more PvE/PvP game modes.\n\n__Island expeditions.__ They are meant to be an always-available component as complement to the core content which is rotating, e.g., raids, world events, Timewalking Dungeons, Warfronts. They're a big disappointment. The content is uninteresting; as of the release, the rewards are paltry (small amount of Azerite gain compared to alternatives). There's no reason to participate in this content.\n\n__Realms and War Mode.__ In Battle for Azeroth, instead of realms wih pve pvp rp status, you now just tirn on war mode to teleport to a new \"server shard.\" You get an XP bonus for turning it on. I always have it on!\n\n__Warforged and Titanforged gear.__ I don't getting gear that automatically levels up to your stats. It's another example of streamlining where there aren't RPG gear sets that vary across levels. Rather they all scale with you.\n\n__Professions__. I like the idea of having separate levels per expansion. It makes it so easier than having to powerlevel via the auction on 500ish levels. However, professions are a joke in the modern era of WoW: there is no advantage to having a profession that you couldn't just buy from the Auction House.\n\nNew continent, races, PvP zones are meh. For leveling, I did the zone order of Vol'dun > Zuldazar > Nazmir, following https://www.wowhead.com/guides/battle-for-azeroth-leveling-and-consumables. The quests have too much cinematic content. Cut scenes are not fun to watch. Include them as part of the gameplay please. Dazar'lor is not a fun capital city for Horde: there's too much elevation, which is especially bad without flying; I much prefer Orgrimmar and Dalaran, even if I understand the design idea to make for a more expansive city instead of Dalaran's basics.\n\nI ended up doing a \"Character Transfer\" to move from the realm Drak'Tharon under the name Always to Illidan under the name Array. I also did a race change to Blood Elf Female, with the customization settings of 3 (Skin Color), 3 (Face), 9 (Hair Style), 2 (Hair Color), 1 (Earrings).\n\nI like the idea of Mythic+ dungeons, which is that you can time dungeons at ridiculously difficult levels of scaling for NPC damage and health. It's a good way of still granting loot that's not just from raids. That said, I don't know how I feel about unbounded levels. I suppose it is nice to see just how far people can get world records. Mythic dungeons do feel a little lazy in terms of content, since the majority of the end-endgame is just scaled levels and not fundamentally new content.\n\nAfter ticking 120, I followed this for the endgame meta: https://www.wowhead.com/gearing-up-in-battle-for-azeroth. Day-to-day, my initial days after 120 consist of:\n\n+ pve | heroic dungeons (with a daily bonus)\n+ pvp | unrated battlegrounds and arena skirmishes (with a daily bonus; and a weekly bonus which stacks past weeks, so you don't miss out)\n+ occasional | warfronts, brawls, world events, timewalking dungeons, weekend bonus event\n+ misc | world quests (with a daily bonus)\n+ misc | farming achievements\n\nThis would get me gear with ilvl 320+ (pre 8.1+). At that point, day-to-day would be to:\n\n+ pve | mythic dungeons (locked weekly, weekly bonus)\n+ pve | raid finder (locked weekly)\n+ pvp | unrated battlegrounds and arena skirmishes (with a daily bonus; and a weekly bonus which stacks past weeks, so you don't miss out))\n+ dailies | emissary world quest (for reputation, azerite power, ilvl reward)\n+ weeklies | warfronts, weekend bonus event, island expeditions\n+ occasional | brawls, world events, timewalking dungeons\n+ misc | farming achievements\n\nThe end-game for ilvl 340+ (pre 8.1+ numbers but content is same for 8.1+) is to get into a decent guild then. Then grinding for ilvl 380-390 (highest possible before patch 8.1.0) is:\n\n+ pve | mythic+ dungeons (no locks, weekly bonus)\n+ pve | normal, heroic, mythic raids (locked weekly)\n+ pvp | rated arena and battlegrounds (with a daily bonus; and a weekly bonus which stacks past weeks, so you don't miss out)\n+ dailies | emissary world quest (for reputation, azerite power, ilvl reward)\n+ weeklies | warfronts, weekend bonus event, island expeditions\n+ occasional | brawls, world events, timewalking dungeons\n+ misc | farming achievements\n\nOptimally, I would play until I experienced 95% of BFA's content. This means roughly ilvl 340 right before you join a guild to run heroic raids, Mythic+ dungeons, and rated PvP. The rest requires more serious commitment and is more of the same but with a community and higher-level gameplay from players.\n\n## On Classes\n\nI main a Rogue. In retrospect, I would probably choose a class that lets me spec to two roles and not just locked to DPS (e.g., Monk for DPS/Healer, Druid for all, or Demon Hunter for DPS/Tank). Modern WoW balances the class specializations so all DPS roles, heal roles, and tank roles are roughly the same. This makes hybrids far better whereas in Wrath of the Lich King and before, specialty classes were always best. I've played all Rogue specs intensively. I enjoy Subtlety the most for its bursty damage. Combat/Outlaw is nice for chaining combo points, following Slice and Dice/Roll the Bones, and long-term abilities like Adrenaline Rush. Assassination is fun for laying up dots and just maneuveringâthis lets you put more effort toward positioning in the field and timing attacks.\n\nI also used to play a Tauren Warrior as a tank and Undead Priest as a healer in my Burning Crusade days. Dalton played a Warlock. Danny played a paladin.\n\n## On Factions and Realms\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/8lsvih/comment/dzimw2x\n\nGreat point. Because of this, the best choice is Horde, and the most populated/highest rank Horde realm. There are nonadvantages to having faction balance (in fact, the advantage skews the opposite so it's easier for the finder queue). I do like the appeal of the Human aesthetic, and also the best racial ability in the game of Every Man for Himself (at least before it was nerfed in modern WoW to share cooldown with trinket).\n\n## On Alts\n\nOverall, I never really took advantage of this. There are certain features that incenvitize getting alts (such as new expansions offering new classes), and the instant leveling feature you get with that new expansion. But many achievements on a character are not shared across the account (as of 09/2018, this includes reputation). It doesn't make sense to have to re-farm all of these per character. Rather, it would be nice if all collectibles, including Achievements were shared across the account. Certain things may not make sense, such as in-game currency (e.g., Gold, Honor Points) and quests.\n\n## todos (before I stopped playing)\n\n+ to farm\n  + item level\n    https://www.wowhead.com/gearing-up-in-battle-for-azeroth\n  + achievements\n    + farm nightslayer armor transmog from molten core\n    + solo old dungeons and raids\n      + firelands | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLHRM5GHOYM\n        + note can't solo \"only the penitent\" though\n    + flying in draenor (https://www.wowhead.com/draenor-pathfinder-guide)\n    + scrap 500 items\n    + various battlegrounds and pve achievements\n    https://www.wowhead.com/gearing-up-in-battle-for-azeroth#pvp-and-war-mode\n    https://www.wowhead.com/guides/conquest-points-wow-pvp-gearing\n    https://www.wowhead.com/battle-for-azeroth-dungeons-overview#achievements\n  + water walking mount (farm timewalking badges for angler reputation; need to farm ~100 more dungeons for total of 5.25k reputation (i have 1.5k))\n    https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/9orm46/you_can_get_your_azure_water_strider_mount_today/\n  + professions meta\n  + specific utilities that are helpful\n    + all the hearthstones\n      + https://www.wowhead.com/item=65274/cloak-of-coordination#comments\n    + mount with repair vendor\n    + water walking mount\n    + sky golem\n    + gears for maximum passive movement speed, maximum swim speed\n  + reputation\n  + collections, e.g., mounts, pets, appearance\n  + cataclysm battle pets\n  + unlearned flight locations\n+ addons\n  + reorganize action bars so cooldown buttons are all large and upfront. these\n    are what you monitor. the rest can either be hidden or left at bottom.\n  + move target debuffs, player energy, and player hp closer to center\n  + move garrison and class hall buttons to minimap\n  + warcraft logs https://www.wowhead.com/how-to-use-warcraft-logs-to-improve-character-performance\n  + rework macros\n    https://www.wowhead.com/getting-into-legion-pvp-guide\n  + auctioneer\n  + gathermate2\n\n## Resources (as of 2019)\n\n+ https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/illidan/Array\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/ | community and news\n+ https://worldofwarcraft.com/ | armory\n+ http://www.wowhead.com/ | guides and items\n  + http://www.wowhead.com/outlaw-rotation-guide\n+ https://wow.gamepedia.com/ | wiki\n+ http://www.wowprogress.com | raiding and progress\n+ https://raider.io | raiding and progress\n+ https://www.wow-professions.com | profession guides\n+ https://www.curseforge.com/wow/ | addons\n+ https://www.worldofwargraphs.com | statistics\n+ https://realmpop.com/ | realm statistics\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/5pgqmh/what_is_the_best_legion_zone_to_go_first_second/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/34xah2/who_is_in_your_crz_us/ | cross realm zones list\n+ http://www.ravenholdt.net | rogue guide\n\nPlaying history:\n\n+ 2009-2010 (WowCrack The Burning Crusade, retail Wrath of the Lich King)\n+12/2015 (Cataclysm)\n+ 09/2018-10/2018 (Battle for Azeroth)\n+ 05/2019 (Battle for Azeroth)\n\nIn 2017 and 09/2018, I used my own UI.\n+ auto sell grey & repair\n+ bagnon\n+ bartender4\n+ capping battleground timers\n+ details! damage meter\n+ gladius\n+ gtfo\n+ inflight taxi timer\n+ mapster\n+ mikscrollingbattletext\n+ minimap range extender\n+ npcscan\n+ omnicc\n+ prat 3.0\n+ sexymap\n+ shadowed unit frames\n+ tomtom\n+ worldflightmap\n\nIn 10/2018, I switched to ElvUI, which has a much cleaner default interface.

    "score": "8",
    "date_started": "01/01/12",
    "date_finished": "5/4/19",
    "comments": "Mother 3 is iconic in its touching yet hilarious story and characters, charming soundtrack, and beautiful pixel artwork. The game ages very well even when playing this in 2019 (GBA pixel art and turn-based combat generally does much better than, say, 3D action-adventures from the PS1-2/Xbox (360)/Gamecube era).\n\n__Story/Characters.__ Mother 3 stands out in its series for its ambitions on a sorrowful tale of coming back from loss. Rather than a fantastical slice-of-life story, it centers around select characters from the family. Standard to the series, the characters stand out in their unique personalities. Items, equipment, status ailments, enemies are all silly by design. The game is rife with jokes (often meta ones) and cultural references. And the story has deep undertones and social commentary.\n\nCharacter-wise, I didn't actually find them very in-depth beyond the supericial character profile. There aren't unique (or any) dynamics between any of the characters or details that make you appreciate a character.\n\n__Gameplay.__ I'm a big fan of the simplistic combat with core stats and just a handful of unique elements: namely, the combo system (\"Sound Battles\") and HP going down gradually rather than instantaneously (enabling heals to avoid KOs). The fights are actually quite challenging assuming you don't do any grinding as you play through the game.\n\n__Aesthetics/Sound.__ Even more masterful than Earthbound's in polish.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ No-nonsense character stats. They're all core mechanics: HP, PP, Offense, Defense, IQ, Speed.\n+ Time shift and the introduction of currency.\n+ Feeling feverish (and being unable to run when any party member has a fever or is dead) before learning a spell.\n+ GBA is the perfect console for enabling variety in sprite animations. They're loss blocky and more fluid in moving limbs in cutscenes for example.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Running mechanic of a dash you have to build momentum for and can stop when colliding with wall. I prefer the convenience of running as usual (e.g., Pokemon), but I can appreciate this different mechanic too. It especially allows for different interactions such as dashing into doors or debris to take them down.\n+ Death penalty does not exist for first four chapters. From Chapter 5 on, you lose half of your DP but you can also put it all in the bank.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ I don't know if the Happy Box is a flagrant social statement against television. But that does seem a bit backward, almost as if Mother 3 is incredibly idealistic about a perfect communal village society without currency and locked doors, and then in reins capitalism.\n+ The sequence of Needles to pull felt a little redundant and plainly boring to be honest. I feel like they could have cut down a few to keep the game more packed.\n+ The grind at end of Chapter 7 to fight the Masked Man is unreal. I didn't need to grind at all in the game before, only gaining EXP from enemies as I progressed the story. Here, Masked Man is level 65 and I came in at level 45. I grinded 10 levels.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ http://walkthrough.starmen.net/mother3/\n+ https://wikibound.info/wiki/Status_ailment\n\n+ mgba settings | https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba/issues/461\n\nI played it using the mGBA emulator. I used the Japanese ROM patched with mother3.fobby.net's fan translation (v1.2, last updated 6/9/14). On emulators, I used Visual Boy Advance long ago, but it is no longer maintained, last updated in 2004. VBA-M is a recent fork and not as updated as mGBA (https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/52n6ky/whats_the_difference_between_vbam_and_vbarr/, https://emulation.miraheze.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance_emulators). I started to play this game from scratch again on 4/28/19, where I stopped at Chapter 5 after beating Fearsome Pig Mask. I took advantage of the GBA's emulator for fast-forward (useful for grinding) and save states (useful for saving within fights).",

    "comments": "As a one-sentence summary, The Last Guardian features a rich minimalistic story, beautiful environments, character models, music, and atmosphere, but at the cost of frustrating controls and overall bad gameplay to traverse from one puzzle platform to the next.\n\nLast Guardian's major flaw is its controls, making for such a frustrating experience that I couldn't enjoy the rest. This includes its most unique asset: Trico. I like the idea of having a beast to control, particularly in adding a good pacing as, for example, you feed him barrels and watch him look and then eat them; or you and he encounter a new area and he walks around to play a little; and I also love the ideas that it can enable for puzzle design. However, this is easily one of the most frustrating mechanics in video game history. The idea did not work well in practice, and I find it hard-to-believe that fans out there are willing to defend this as \"realism\"; you don't treat it like any other house animal, or just feed it and hope it's more willing to listen to your commands (this is symbolic AI, not an actual animal; the codes to program its commands are not nearly that complex). With video games, you already have a barrier in front of you based on the limited actinos your playable character can do. Now with a beast, you're adding an additional source of nuisance as the beast takes much longer to execute commands and can often deviate away from what you're trying to get at (e.g., it walks away when you're trying to approach a ledge). It's not even animal logic, but AI logic aimed to imitate animal logic. It's like an entire game made out of escort missions., and the escort is an animal. This can make puzzles tedious to solve even if you already found out the solution. Even the boy's controls can be really bad at times; and climbing Trico is always a nightmare in maneuvering your direction correctly. In addition, camera is noticeably bad in tight areas.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ The soft color palette and smooth textures not unlike Shadow of the Colossus and Ico.\n+ Water graphics as it soaks even just a part of Trico's tail.\n+ Bivbrations on the controller as the ground rumbles from Trico walking.\n+ Some sequences can be absolutely beautiful if they're not marred by controls. For example, the sequence where you're climbing trees and rope to get away from the other Trico. The music and beast below adds a tense, palpable atmosphere.\n+ I love the epic sequences like the cinematic flashback of how the boy and Trico got into the Nest. And when Trico overcomes his fear of the mirrors. And how it slowly grows its horns and wings.\n+ Cinematic sequences that feature your Trico (i.e., with spears and blood and all), and your movement on Trico. This makes it feel as part of the game and not just a video being played.\n+ The stumbling as the boy walks.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ No HUD or healthbar of any sort.\n+ Tossing a barrel up a hole in a railroad so Trico can eat and then move again. This is an example of just how frustrating this controls can be. And it appears again when you have to feed Trico after you fall from the tree.\n+ The water sequence. Holy shit getting Trico to dive is hard. And when yuo do get him to do it, you have to be holding below him, so you on top of his back doesn't get trapped on the top half of the hole as he enters through it. And the wave sequence is so convoluted.\n+ I just love it when you're trying to direct Trico to jump through a sequence of pillars. And Trico just jumps backwards and makes you lose progress..\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-last-guardian/\n+ I like this plot explanation as I agree with all of it as it's not so much ambiguity for these (sans the ratio for the number of people in a barrel; I can see it being interpreted as either people or just a natural resource in the land that the Master of the Valley witholds as a reward) | https://www.reddit.com/r/thelastguardian/comments/5liq6x/lore_of_the_last_guardian_massive_spoilers/\n\nI mostly followed the walkthrough if the puzzles were not immediately obvious. The game can be incredibly tedious in trial-and-error particularly as controlling Trico takes so long. So many of the puzzle solutions are convoluted too (see, e.g., the constant wait for Trico when you're stuck in the tree). Because you also don't know the leaping strength of Trico, it's hard to tell what parts are simply solved by getting on Trico's back, pointing appropriately, and being patient.",

    "comments": "Mortal Kombat 11 is the best Mortal Kombat in fighting mechanics, story, and aesthetics. I love the cinematic feeling of the 5-hour story mode. It blends nicely with the fight scenes like an interactive film. Gameplay-wise, the moveset is top notch and with many iconic playable characters. The environments and cosmetics like character models and brutality of the fights are on-point.\n\nMortal Kombat 11's major flaw is the grind in Tower and Crypt modes (which are the major modes in the game outside the 5 hour Story mode and online PvP). The system is predatory, designed to keep you playing the game to accumulate currency or otherwise avoid losing them on certain purchases by obtaining them alternatively with real money (e.g., skins, easy fatalities). And who would do all that grind for a fighting game of all genres!? Tower mode has locked towers and characters, and enemies are stronger than usual and with ludicrous RNG modifiers (https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/bgeeku/im_sorry_but_i_have_to_post_this_i_was_watching/). You can't progress without leveling from easier Towers, equipment augments and consumables from chests in the Krypt, daily bonuses, weekly bonuses, and Race against Time bonuses. While crypts are not lootboxes in that you can purchase them with real money, they remain in-game RNG as the item locations are random; this makes it take longer to get 100% until you're able to accumuilate enough currency to open all 600 chests. Moreover, Crypt mode is a walking simulator---it is needless time to even find the appropriate chests to open. How cool would this game be with just three modes: Story, (online and offline) Multiplayer, and Arcade (Tower of Time); where unlocks should done by furthering appropriately in each mode, without the need for any currency in the game.\n\n__Story.__ Story is as convoluted yet fun as Mortal Kombat always has been. I especially love how this games ties in the older generation of characters with the new one. Liu Kang hasn't been a hero as Mortal Kombat's poster child since MK4, and he takes front stage while also not so much that it detracts from other's heroic deeds. To the best of my limited knowledge, this is the best story of the series.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Boy are fighting games complicated. There are four core attack moves, one for each arm and leg, a block, and a grab button. Then there are counters, special moves, environment cues, combos, fatal blows, fatalities/brutalities. I already have trouble remembering the diversity of attacks, let alone master how to time and when to use them. I think much of this is justified as it adds complexity that simply weak/strong attacks from, e.g., Dark Souls cannot provide.\n\n__Aesthetics/Sound.__ Game is beautifully rendered. I love the character models and environments. The fatalities and gorey attacks are all awesome.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Women being more fully clothed. There's a lot of controversy on this, where it's fair for Mortal Kombat to exhibit skimpily-dressed women similar to Dead or Alive as it's part of its core appeal. I actually don't think so as much as it's more about the gory combat. In this case, I think the women's costumes are well-done like Kitana's and Skarlet's. Kitana does look a little too close to the many Asian ninjas already in the game though, and her original costume is more exotic and fitting to Edenia in Outworld (albeit could be done to be less middle-easterny). This version of Kitana is my waifu (and suspiciously like an ex..).\n+ I'm always a fan of the diversity of characters in demographic region, sex, and their cultures (particularly Asians).\n+ I love all the signature moves and quotes (\"Get over here!\", \"Your soul is mine!\").\n+ So happy for Liu Kang and Kitana's happy ending. Don't recall that ever happening before; they finally did it!\n+ The opening banter between every pair of characters.\n+ The fatalities. Wow are they fun.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ There's a lot of Cassie Cage ass shots in this game. Like disproportionately to any other female character most of which have zero.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Krpyt mode (not unique to Mortal Kombat 11). It feels unnecessary to have a walking simulator in order to loot items. I don't get the purpose of having this aside from extending the length of the game.\n+ DRM is always-on even in single player mode, requiring you be online to accumulate any currency.\n+ Microtransactions and multiple different currencies: Koins, Hearts, Soul Fragments, Time Crystals. It definitely feels like they added complexity to purposefully confuse players and distract them from real cash.\n+ Tower mode's story seemed a little unnecessary given the grand production values of story mode. I like that they kept the fighting game's tradition of per-character stories. But a narrated picture book is not what I had in mind. It feels like a cheap experience.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ story summary | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDII_QKoNEQ\n\nMotivated to play this game because of the release date, nostalgia, haven't played a fighting game in a while, and am curious what the recent reboots are like given the high praise since Mortal Kombat 9 (2011) by the same developers. NetherRealm Studios' respawned the whole franchise and including Injustice as a spinoff. I'm not a fan of fighting games overall because of their 2D levels with little environmental interaction (I prefer combat like Dark Souls; a closer analogy could even be Dragon Ball Tenkaichi Budokai where the levels are 3D).",

    "comments": "Spider-Man is a cinematic action-adventure. It features engaging combat, a linear story connecting all the main villains, and sidequests rife with minigames. I especially love the overarching world based on Manhattan. Unfortunately, Spider-Man is also hampered by the occasional repetition with its beat-em-up mechanics and repetitive level designs, and not doing more with its open world and point A to point B levels in further fleshing out the city/environment.\n\n__Story.__ Standard cinematic fanfare that remains core to Spider-Man with a standard story, action and comedy. I think what works especially well is the band of characters, where Spider Man alone isn't the hero in many of the fights (and often fails). Yuri acts much like Batman's Commissioner Gordon. And damn that ending. It's a tragedy on both sides of Octavius and Aunt May. Although given the typical cinematic fanfare, I still really liked its ambition in going for such a soulful tragedy staying true to Spider Man's growth.\n\n__Levels/Environments.__ No Spider-Man game (or maybe video game overall) shows New York as much as this and recent Marvel Spider-Man films do. It's a linear and standard setting, from scene A to scene B and with no absolutely gorgeous areas and designs in particular or anything.\n\nThe semi-open world and linearity with side missions reminds me much of Yakuza. Spider-Man also nails exploration within the larger city well via backpack and landmark collectibles, which also add to the lore of Spider-Man and the city.\n\nI don't know how I feel about the agenda-pushing in this game and Marvel films overall: diversity cards with Asian-Americans and Black families, doing the right thing, and saluting police offers as heroes.\n\n__Gameplay.__ There are a handful of moves much like a fighting game, which can be mastered in an hour. The focus on aerial combat in particular reminds me of Devil May Cry. I wish there were a more Spider-Man-like mechanic for crowd control. The camera feature is iconically Spider Man and really well-done, from the camera as a mode to not restrict typical movement and slowing down speed so you can easily take a picture.\n\nThey especially nailed the swinging mechanics to traverse from one city zone to the next. This includes your standard Swing with acceleration, Web Zip for sharp turns, Wall Run, and Zip to Point and Point Launch for low-height buildings like those in Hell's Kitchen and Greenwich Village.\n\nEnemies are generic beat-em-up types. I do love how they included many iconic Spider Man villains into the game though.\n\nProgression with XP and Tokens for Suits, a Skill Tree, and Gadgets is very much like Insomniac's Ratchet and Clank. They do progression systems well where it's not a grindfest or too complicated.\n\n__Aesthetics/Sound.__\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ I think the action sequences with Triangle as a special generic button and sometimes Square at cutscenes fits the cinematic action-adventure game well.\n+ The hallugenic level with Scorpion is really fun. Clearly innovative in environment (not just more urban cityness) and allowing Spider-Man mechanics to explore more freely the traversal.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Other playable characters: Mary Jane and Miles. I did really like the level where you play as Mary Jane and Spider Man backs you up though. That's really cool in highlighting new Spider Man mechanics by letting you experience the sidekick role. Same when MJ gets a Taser. It's literally a stealth game.\n+ Minigames like the circuit, spectograph, and descrambling. I get that minigames can be a fun diversity addition as they are in Ratchet and Clank. I don't know about these ones though.\n+ Stealth appears occasionally and feels like yet another fun-but-barely-servicable feature to the game.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/spider-man-ps4/\n\nMotivated to play this as a PS4 exclusive; Insomniac making new IP since Ratchet and Clank; and nostalgia of previous Spider-Man games on PlayStation.

    "comments": "I love how true Final Fantasy IX is to its comic-esque almost Pixar-ish feel (I only call it Pixar-ish because I can't find a better name for this polished, cute, universal appeal.) It really plays true to FF's roots of Moogles, Chocobos, and the larger fantasy narrative of a medieval setting, a princess and an old hag ruler, and a dashing pirate to steal her away. The Active Time Events are lovely vignettes as a device to peek into the other characters.\n\nIn terms of flaws, Final Fantasy IX fails most in becoming mired in melodrama, sticking almost too closely to a standard fanfre combat and leveling system, and with a forgettable soundtrack.\n\n__Story.__ I love that all the characters have a strong personality, even Zidane who even grabs Garnet's butt as they're climbing a ladder. And Zidane being protective of Vivi. The story can veer too wildly in comedy and melodrama unfortunately, but for the most part I enjoyed its archetypal plot.  I especially don't like that every character in Final Fantasy series must have some grand role in the overall story of cosmic proportions. Here, the reveal that Zidane too is a clone much like Vivi, and brother to Kuja is a classic example of B-rated melodrama. Winning through the power of friendship. Final boss of Necron and the additional cosmic proportions are even more unnecessary. I wish it ended at Disc 2.\n\n__Aesthetics/Music.__ Gorgeous backgrounds and color palette, an OST that resonates vibrance.\n\n__Gameplay.__ I like that each character has a designated role. It fits their archetype and plays well into the story. The AP gauge and abilities attached to weapons makes the process far more streamlined than, say, the convoluted Junction process of FF8 which requires leveling up to target specific stats, abilities and attachments via Guardian Force summons. Overall, FF9 plays it safe in terms of the turn-based combat.\n\n__Aesthetics/Sound.__ The comic-y character models suits the game well. The soundtrack was forgettable though.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ The mechanic of obtaining permanent Abilities and Magic via leveling them up via AP given certain equipment.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ There are many missable \"Key Items\" which don't serve any purpose aside from as an accomplishment trophy. I don't like that these exist, and also that they're missable.\n+ There are too many missable items overlal, whether it be sidequests requiring you to complete them in a precise order as you progress through the store, or Stealing from bosses. There's not nearly as many of these in other Final Fantasy games. For example, of 23 total according to a walkthrough, there is Tetra Master, Jump Rope, Mognet, Friendly Creatures, Ragtime Mouse, Frog Catching, Stilzkin Shopping, Stellazio. Some sidequests are incredibly convoluted and detract from the game's intended pacing, e.g., Nero Brothers. By the time I hit Disk 4, I just gave up and rushed to beat the game.\n+ I prefer FF8's Triple Triad card game over FF9's Tetra Master. There's more variety in card conditions and win types, and special A and S cards like all the playable characters. I also prefered the single-number mechanics in each direction, as opposed to 4 numbers including physical/magical defense and directions that the card attacks. There's probability in this game too which adds to the confusion.\n+ There's quite a bit of grinding to stay in level range of the enemies.\n+ Tents only restore half HP.\n\n## References and Miscellanea\n\n+ Until Lindblum, I followed the guide https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197338-final-fantasy-ix/faqs/36844. It was recommended from generally googling for a good resource. Then I followed the guide https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197338-final-fantasy-ix/faqs/71891. It's the most up-to-date in GameFAQs, and it also has HTML so images and links!\n+ plot summary https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMY_tpvGF-Y\n\nI played it on IOS. The iOS port is lauded compared to, e.g., FF7's: better controls, optional quality of life cheats such as frame-skip for faster grinding, cloud saves. The frame-skip, and the auto-battle button (which may be available in the original version too), makes grinding very easy: just wander around until a battle encounter, then have auto-attack just work for you. In general for versions, I would prefer the original in order to best appreciate it at its time (and only rarely go for the remastered if it's a strict quality improvement). However, this isn't always convenient.\n\nI lost my saved state when I played it on my iPad Air 2 but did not save it on the cloud when I moved to the new iPad Pro (2018). I had just finished Madain Sari near the end of Disc 2 and was onto Journey to the Iifa Tree. Instead of starting over, I changed to play on Steam which is the best version. The closest 100% game Steam game save I found is from https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/184962-final-fantasy-ix/74882812, which is level 1 and no Abilities. I played at 1920x1440 4:3 aspect ratio; with my 1440p monitor this benefited from playing with the walkthrough side-by-side. Following the new game save, I decided to just beat the game. I did not complete all sidequests, e.g., Chocograph, Friendly Creatures, Ragtime Mouse, Mountain Cracks. I did not 100% complete some sidequests: Stiltzkin.\n\nPlaying this, I realize so much why JRPGs require playing with a walkthrough. One aspect is finding every hidden chest/item (especially missable items and optional sidequests). Another aspect are the mechanics tips. For example, in FF9 you should not sell off all your old equipmentâlater, there will be a synthesis shop for creating special equipment from them. This differs from other JRPGs like Dragon Quest. Another example is a guide on what level you should be, and when you should grind vs not. That significantly determines the game's pacing. Another example is what to Steal from enemies, if at all.",

    "comments": "Super Mario Galaxy is a masterpiece in the franchise. It innovates with gravity-based level designs which are sprawling with connected mini-worlds and innovative concepts (e.g., blasting through a zone with blue and orange stars; using the Wiimote to collect Star Bits and perform other interactions; fusing 2D and 3D platforming); beautiful, diverse environments; an orchestral soundtrack; and an overall refinement with its Spin move, powerups, and enemy variety. The overall cohesiveness of Super Mario Galaxy as a grand, galactic adventure is executed very well. Like Super Mario 64, Super Mario Galaxy is also a pinnacle example of its console generation, where here SMG integrates the Wii's sensor bar and Wiimote accelerometer. The story is not as minimal as 2D-style Mario games, and for the better.\n\nCommon among many games in the series, I find Mario's major flaw is threefold: sluggish controls which favor acceleration and momentum over precision (replaying in 2021, I've gone to appreciate it more); lacking camera control; and jump scenarios as a staple challenge. The first flaw is subjective: I just can't stand the momentum. The imprecision is objectively bad at times in Super Mario Galaxy however; for example, the underwater controls are too difficult to move to a specific location and get an item. I do like that unlike other platformers like Crash, Mario has much more complexity in its jumping moveset, enabling advanced players to express themselves under more nuance. For the second, a directed camera can be great, but Super Mario Galaxy's often warps depth perception and can lead to incorrectly timed jumps/attacks. Third, I'm just not a fan of Mario-style platformers, as one core element is jumping from one platform to the next. The challenge of landing such jumps, and often punishing failure with death, feels artificial: jump challenges are not something I look for in a video game unless they're more immersed as part of the video game.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Mario games have always been collectithons, primarily focused on Stars and with a few secondary collectibles: here, Star Bits, Coins, and 1-Ups. I love how in Mario games overall that collectithons have never really been tedious as, for example, Spyro can sometimes be. Because the goal is only the maximum number of Stars, you can still zoom by levels and not enter every crevice in fear of missing on one item as you can in Spyro. Mario does not incenvitize full exploration, and for the better. This is especially important for Mario games where the pacing and rhythm of constant moving momentum is important.\nDifficulty-wise, the game is surprisingly hard for a modern Nintendo games. It harkens back to the SNES era as I would die (and occasionally Game Over) quite often in timing the right mechanics. I like this level of difficulty.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ I love the feeling of collecting Star Bits with the Wiimote scrambled across the screen.\n+ The movement of blasting off from world to world feels fantastic. It adds a sense of rhythm and to the lore that more ad hoc platformers like Super Mario 64 doesn't do.\n+ Challenge runs. Although they repeat content, I like the sense of rhythm they add. Fore example, bosses are easy once you know the tactic. But Daredevil adds an additional sense of fun by forcing you to execute it flawlessly.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ The dialog during gameplay pauses the pacing and feels almost too slow. Signposts still exist. I'd much rather faster text scrolling and/or the ability to move while conversing.\n+ Saving the game pauses the rest of the game, so you have to wait for it. This is a few seconds but it adds up with the rest of the cutscenes to ~10-20s to go from completing one galaxy and selecting the next. Very tedious.\n+ Underwater is an especailly notorious example of how bad the inflexible camera can be.\n+ There are too many bosses with only slight deviations.\n+ There's no indicator when you should be applying Spirit Vision. This makes it often impossible to know unless you spam it or look up how to progress specific quests.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/super-mario-galaxy/Walkthrough\n+ https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-super-mario-galaxy-1-hd-texture-mod, https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-how-to-install-texture-packs-custom-textures-info\n\nI played on a Wii emulator (Dolphin) with the HD texture mod. The HD textures signicantly help in making the game feel more modern with 1080p/4K resolution; it is a jarring experience however that cutscenes and certain areas are not re-textured. I would use a Wii sensor bar and Wiimote for the optimal vision of the game on modern hardware. However, for convenience I ended up using Keyboard and Mouse (used default layout, and switched for Roll/Surf levels); see this for Xbox One controller (https://www.reddit.com/r/DolphinEmulator/comments/7m5h2m/what_is_the_best_control_setup_for_mario_galaxy/). I don't have enough games to warrant owning the Wii equipment. The Keyboard and Mouse combo does lead to a noticeable difference in experience as you have to change controls for certain levels, and certain mechanics are just harder/easier on the Wiimote (I think the mouse cursor is much more precise than the Wiimote sensor, which makes Bubble Breeze easier to control.) I beat the game with 100 stars. I missed some of the 120 stars possible with Mario: 2 Luigi hidden stars, the 3 Trial Galaxies, and all 15 purple stars after you beat the game.",

    "comments": "\n\n__On minigames.__ Overall, I don't like the direction Spyro 2 and 3 headed with a larger variety of minigames and extra player mechanics. I appreciate the exploration, but at most it goes to show how important sticking to the core is important. Many of the mini-games and characters are hit-or-miss, at best being B-rated versions of genre games, e.g., Sparx as a flying combat arcade game; Agent 9 as third-person shooter. Yakuza 0 is an excellent example of how mini-games can help a game: while many are simply fetch mechanics, it's the lore that keeps them interesting. I think a similar spirit has to be adopted in any other game like Spyro given that mini-games will always have worse mechanics than the genre games that are devoted to mastering them.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Enemies drop gems like in Spyro the Dragon rather than an additional effective currency of killed-enemies, which unlocks powerups in the level.\n+ All mechanics such as Hover, Swim, Headbash are unlocked from the beginning of the game.\n+ I like that they made the race flying a core part of all flight levels. It upgrades it more as a core mini-game which I agree with.\n+ I do love the variety of games each extra playable character has. For example, Agent 9 has third-person shooter, first-person shooter, and sling-em-up Duck Hunt style. I also liked the Kangaroo's platformer Crash Bandicoot-esque level.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Dragon Eggs are closer to the Spyro the Dragon's petrified dragons than Spyro 2's gems, which means fewer minigames.\n+ The non-Spyro playable characters. I like the experimentation with new mechanics. But they're also a hit or miss.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Like Spyro 2, there's some fair amount of linearity. For example, levels within a zone must be progressed in sequence in order to collect the requisite number of eggs and unlock later parts. I much prefer the nonlinear exploration even if that sequence is what I would ultimately do.\n+ Metroidvania backtracking still exists in this game, although `it's not nearly as bad as Spyro 2. Any locked-out parts are explicitly cordoned off.\n+ I feel like Year of the Dragon is the turning point for the series to become even more kiddy---with the baby dragon eggs and kiddier supporting characters---and my perceived difficulty of this game being easier, more streamlined and with secrets/routes more obvious. The Spyro magic is still there. But the audience seems to have shifted ever so slightly.\n+ Enchanted Towers may be the worst Spyro level I've played. It's not egregiously bad but it does have notably bad points: Rescue the Lost Wolf challenge is buggy and hard to get the wolf to follow you; you're forced to backtrack to get all flying dragons and missing gems with Sgt. Byrd.\n+ Controls for Sparx mini-games are plain bad. You can't dash while strafing which makes it especially bad to kite enemies and then lose your strafing position.\n+ Models for the baby dragons are recycled and not unique like Spyro the Dragon.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/spyro-year-of-the-dragon/\n\n I beat the game (100% excluding skillpoints) in 11 hours according to the menu in-game time.",

    "comments": "Ripto's Rage is a polished Spyro the Dragon. It maintains the core collectithon mechanics with excellent level designs, beautiful environments, memorable music, and diverse enemies. Importantly, Spyro 2 also adds a few core improvements: manual camera movement with the R3 stick, a more substantiated story with colorful characters and cutscenes per world (e.g., Elora, Mr. Moneybags, Professor); a replacement of the checkpoint system/Petrified Dragons with fairies and Jewel challenges (translation: many more minigames); spirit particles to unlock level superpowers (and beyond just supercharge and super flame); and Hover, Spit, Swim, Climb, and Headbash to further complexify the mechanics. Levels are on a whole new scale not just with the excellent integrated explorations across subareas, puzzles, and iconic soundtracks, but now with lore, mini-civilizations, and NPCs.\n\nUnfortunately thanks to metroidvania backtracking, Spyro 2 sacrifices a lot of player freedom in an attempt at a fairly linear vision. There are so many collectibles in levels that are locked behind future unlockable mechanics. This makes progression feel a lot less satisfying than it is in Spyro the Dragon, as you can safely achieve 100% on each level and be satisfied that you never have to revisit the level again. Similarly, there's a linear route based on talismans, where you must complete all levels before taking on the zone's boss; in Spyro the Dragon, it was collectible requirements. Within each level, Spyro 2 power-ups also only unlock after killing a certain number of enemies. This further shackles exploration, forcing backtracking where only after killing mobs can you fully explore the level. One of Spyro the Dragon's core strengths behind its collectithon exploration is the ability to uncover secrets at your own pace. Spyro 2's metroidvania backtracking---both across levels and within each level---significantly diminishes that freedom.\n\nSome memories:\n\n+ Using a cheatcode to play as Black Spyro.\n+ Being gated in mechanics such as swimming underwater by Mr. Money.\n+ Playing ice Hockey and removing the possessions from the Idol Statues in Colossus.\n+ Herding the cows in Zephyr.\n+ Exploring the outer walls and collecting gems in Autumn Plains.\n+ Dying multiple times (~8) to Gulp. He's truly the Dark Souls of Spyro. I don't remember him being this difficult!\n+ Following Agent Zero's Secret Hideout in Cloud Temples. That music is nostalgic.\n+ All the challenges in the last level, Dragon Shore.\n+ Getting permanent Superflame after 100% completion.

    "comments": "The game is effectively a meticulous collectithon of Gems, Dragons, Dragon Eggs, and Skill Points. This makes it sound tedious, but it works well with its level design, diverse fun enemies, lush aesthetics, colorful characters, and cartoonish story. The levels are particularly well-integrated with the mechanics, incentivizing exploration to collect, and revisiting areas once you get new mechanics like flying. I love the soundtrack. It playing as you progress a level is so tone-setting. Also the enemy sounds like the Egg snatcher who taunts you. It's also an early successful attempt at ``open world'' gameplay: Spyro offers a collection of hub worlds feeling like an open world but without feeling like there's no open direction.\n\nCore mechanics are simple, and overloaded in uses: battling enemy varieties, chests, and exploration (e.g., gliding around hidden areas).\n\nI generally dislike puzzles in games, but Spyro does it well. They're part of the exploration, and mechanics to leran how to beat enemies or traverse a level are directly integrated into the mechanics, e.g., super charge to get higher jumps to areas, super flame to destroy metal doors or the impossible enemies.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ I love the idea of petrified dragons as checkpoints (equivalent of bonfires). They not only enable exploration to get them all but they also serve the dragon captured lor and add quips of dialogue for Spyro.\n+ The Sparx radar newly introduced in Reignited is a lifesaver. I can't imagine going through a whole level and then trying to find the one gem you missed..\n+ Cheat codes including cosmetics. Clearly a PS1-style generation trope.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ I hate the flight levels. It's a speedrun executing a perfect route, requiring knowing an often intuitive route and an unforgiving execution (take Sunny Flight for example).\n Wow at the convoluted two jumps in Tree Tops. That's rather difficult to see without knowing a priori.\n+ You can exit levels from the menu after reaching 100% instead of having to run all the way back to the exit. However, this does not work in Gnasty's World where there seems to be a trigger for opening the next level after you properly exit. That's inconsistent.\n\nSome memories:\n\n+ Entering the top outer boundary of Stone Hills. As a kid, I remember being so surprised at being in an area I thought was out of bounds of the game (like Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow).\n+ Arriving at Magic Crafters at the first time, hearing that music, and the arid landscape. So nostalgic.\n\n## References and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/spyro-reignited-trilogy\n\nThis entry includes all games, of which includes Spyro the Year of the Dragon which I played the first time. The recorded date is when I played and completed the first game, Spyro the Dragon. My total playtime is about 7 hours, getting 100% on all levels except for the flight levels and Skillpoints. I got 100% excluding Skillpoints later.\n\nThere's a high probability the game will be ported to PC just as Crash Bandicoot did a year after its release date. However I decided to play it now purely for the nostalgia (and because I'm home with Danny).",

    "comments": "Like all Ratchet and Clank games, this game is a refreshingly fun platformer-like action adventure. It has witty dialog with its characters, great level designs, and beautiful colorful environments. It's one of the weaker games in the series due to its streamlining however, trying to aggregate highlights from each new game's innovations but not really doing so effectively; Going Commando and Up Your Arsenal were personally the most memorable for me in its innovations.\n\n__Story.__ The story is serviceable, perhaps too cliche particularly in its revisions of the original version. However, I didn't mind the story as it was primarily a template to establish the quirky characters and meta comedy. I do prefer Ratchet's original background as a more cocky arrogant person who just wanted to help Clank along the way than as a squirrel who looks up to Quark and wants to become a Galactic Ranger. There's also less camraderie or really any dynamic interaction between Ratchet and Clank. It makes the character and Clank more memorable.\n\n__Gameplay/Combat.__ The autoaim mechanic, vibration on Wrench attacks, and many gadgets (e.g., swingshot, hydrodisplacer) make the game feel fluid. I also love all the minigames, e.g., Clank, rail ride, holocar, shoot-em-up aerials.\n\n__Levels.__ The fog of war-esque map, objectives, and Card Collection incenvitizes exploration. I also like that the weapon leveling system encourages using all weapons.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ There is just the right amount of collectibles/optimization to do: Levels, Weapons (and their upgrades), Gold Bolts, Holocards. Currency of Bolts and Raranium is also the right amount.\n+ No missable content.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ They introduced the weapon leveling system of Going Commando. But they don't have any new armors like in Up Your Arsenal? In a similar vein, Bolts aren't all that useful to farm as they're only required to purchase weapons and afterwards, do repairs. It would have been nice for example to keep RYNO as a huge currency item like in the original game. I'm totally okay with endgame farming as that's what you have to do to spend time.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/ratchet-and-clank-ps4/Walkthrough\n+ TheGamingBritShow 2002 vs 2016 Comparison | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kD_QhYgIA4. It's nitpicky, focusing on nostalgia and with certain criticisms just not valid. I do agree in its attempt to become more mainstream, the reboot streamlined some of the edge like the subtler nuances of the capitalism theme. And I do prefer the original, which was effectively a very different game due to its weapons and slightly edgier characters.\n\nI used the guide only after completing a level to backtrack and obtain any missed items. I did not get 100%, e.g., all Gold Bolts or Holocards.",

    "date_finished": "3/28/19",
    "comments": " Sekiro stands out among its Souls predecessors with combat innovations, easily as the most refined in Souls-like games. Most notable are verticality of environments, stealth, and agile movements with guard vs deflect vs jump vs sidestep; poise and deflects overhauilng stamina and parries; integration of many mini-bosses; and a duality of HP widdling vs posture-breaking.\n\nI think Sekiro's biggest flaw is its lack of good enemies outside (mini)bosses. With the ability to both (re)stealth and escape to higher ground, I would expect enemies in Sekiro to be even tougher (e.g., hard hitting) than in Souls/Bloodborne. That's not the case, which makes most of the challenge only really appear at minibosses---not emphasizing the core Dark Souls mechanic where you're in the middle of a zone, running out of Estus Flasks, unsure of when's the next bonfire, and you cautiously trek forward.. The second major flaw is lack of atmosphere: most all enemies are humanoid (lacking the unique mob and boss designs of Souls) and levels are well-lit outdoors with many reused assets (e.g., tree branch). Gone overall are the foreboding elements, e.g., rounding a corner and grabbing loot only to be ambushed by an other worldly creature. This is possibly due to the emphasis on parry and stealth, but I think even with those aspects preserved, the game could add non-humanoid and dungeon-like areas as Nioh does. It was a conscious design effort.\n\nCompared to other Souls games, Sekiro just doesn't stand out in its atmosphere and lightning (c.f., Demon's Souls and Bloodborne), enemy variety, story, and not nearly as iconic NPCs and sidequests (e.g., Solaire, Siegmeyer, Patches). Mechanics-wise, the death penalty system is a major step back. Sekiro fortunately does avoid the common flaws of Souls games, which I appreciate: tricky pathing of sidequests; occasionally mediocre covenant system; occasionally lengthy runback to bosses; and lack of systematic PvP.\n\n__Story.__ Unlike other Souls games, storytelling is explicit. Unfortunately, quality-wise, it's only serviceable as if it were any other AAA title. There's a dozen of Legendary Items constantly referenced in the conversations (e.g., Dragon's Oath, Iron Rule of Shinobi, Mortal Sword, Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Water), and it feels B-rated given its simplistic treatment. This also occurs in Dark Souls to an extent, but fortunately the lack of explicit storytelling and ambiguity lends a bit more credence to the many primordial concepts Dark Souls discusses. I do like certain elements of Sekiro's approach, perhaps inheriting from its diegetic roots: for example, illusions of previous conversations with Kuro; eavesdropping to hear about upcoming bosses. \n\n__Combat/Gameplay.__ Sekiro clearly has the most refined mechanics of the Souls series. Most notable are its timed attacks with a controlled aggressive and passive style; and verticality. I love the Perilous Attack trio of thrusts, sweeps, and grabs, and the appropriate response of deflects (R1) (or Mikiri Counter (O with no directional)), jumps (X), and dodges (O). This makes fights much more complex than Dark Souls/Bloodborne, which almost entirely involves just dodges (O) and the occassional guard and circle-strafing. Other unique elements stand out such as stealth, posture replacing stamina, parry/riposte with enemy posture bars, and enemies having the opportunity to change the rhythm of fights by deflecting your attacks (see below). Gone are the meta of circle-strafing as in Dark Souls 1/2 or I-frame rolls as in Dark Souls 3/Bloodborne, and in with the parry system!\n\nOverall, Sekiro plays as an action-adventure without RPG elements such as stat distributions (and therefore builds), levels, and weapon or armor sets. They're replaced with Skill and Prosthetic upgrade tree. Because there are no upgradeable stats (aside from Prayer Beads, Memories, and Gourd Seeds), damage doesn't increase over time, meaning earlier zones won't be trivially easy later in the game or through farming. (This is a significant gameplay influence on other Souls games where if you accidentally go through zones in an improper order, certain zones can be too easy or too hard. Sekiro establishes a difficulty standard universal across all zones.) At the same time however, there's a lack of replayability due to the lack of builds. This reduces versatility of gameplay (and the ability to play fashionsouls). However, it also keeps the game minimally core to shinobi prosthetic-and-sword style. There are no balance issues with strength builds, magic builds, faith builds, etc.\n\nOther elements inherit from Souls/Bloodborne: for example, block (closer to Nioh via sword, and no damage taken, just poise), single target lock-on, deflects (parries), poise/stagger, backstabs, Sculptor's Idol (bonfire), replenishing gourd (Estus Flask), hub, storage box, consumable Spirit Emblem ammo that replenishes over kills/exploration (effectively Bloodborne's Quicksilver Bullets). Like Bloodborne, there is no equip or item burden.\n\n__Boss and enemy design.__ I love the integration of mini-bosses and bosses in the environment. Rarely are there just doors that lead to a boss zone. (Mini)bosses I especially like: Genichiro, who taught me to deflect and took me around 4-5 hours of straight attempts (I got to the third stage around 10 times before I completed it); Ape if only for its creepy undead second stage; Emma and Isshin as an additional shining example of Sekiro combat. The Ape only took me ~10 tries particularly as I found out the Umbrella worked on the second stage; it's mostly a battle of sprinting, hugging his butt, and pulling the occasional flurry of attacks. The Headless Ape only took me 2 tries, the second attempt being perhaps lucky in that I zerged down the brown Ape first without interruption.\n\nI personally found Genichiro to be as difficult and spent as much time on him as I did for the most notorious Dark Souls/Bloodborne/Nioh bosses: Onryoki and Hino-Enma and Father Gascoigne (these ones particularly mirror as most difficulty was adjusting), Artorias, Friede, Nameless King, Gael. Juzou the Drunkard was not difficult: fighting large-sized Dark Souls bosses taught me how to sprint to circle strafe to hug and attack butts, and dodge sweep attacks. Even on New Game Plus, I found fighting Genichiro extremely difficult. He seemed to do far more posture damage, which kept killing me. After watching LobosJR, I tried two different approaches to his moveset and they drastically changed the dynamics so that I beat him on my first try the next day! (The two movesets: 1. On Genichiro's flurry of attacks, instead of deflecting all of them, just jump away after the first two strikes. This lets you recover posture as well as get a free hit once he terminates the flurry. 2. On Genichiro's jump attack possibly followed by a Perilous Attack, instead of deflecting and then trying to do the appropriate Perilous Attack response, sidestep away, avoid the Perilous Attack by distance, and run (not sprint) back in.)\n\nUnfortunately, while Sekiro has great boss and miniboss fights, it suffers greatly in standard enemy variety. I would much prefer the consistency of all other Souls games. Throughout all of Ashina Outskirts/Castle for example, there is only one soldier type---with a few variations such as shooting---as well as the occasional dog and ogre-type enemy. This base soldier is easy to sprint to them and R1 spam, the same going for the base soldier in Senpou Temple (Monks), Sunken Valley (soldier), and Sunken Valley Passage (Monkeys). In addition, it's easy to hide from enemies and/or renenter stealth by retreating to higher vantage points. This makes progressing through zones is significantly easier than any of the (mini)bosses as they're the only ones that introduce new mechanics.\n\n__Level design.__ The verticality of levels and its incentivized gameplay with stealth make level progression so much more environmentally involved than in Souls. The game feels 3-D and real. Rather than point A to point B, it's all about the approach in moving through levels, exploring to find items/paths, eavesdropping, and targeting isolated enemies. Detection is seamless with dots and arrows signaling yellow and red for caution and alert. You can see the flaw with Souls' point A to point B in Souls speedruns, where it feels weird that you can essentially beat the game by running through all the enemies except bosses; fighting enemies is only necessary insofar as to explore without dying and looting, so you may as well incorporate stealth explicitly to give a better control on this. This is what I praise Dark Souls games for: it incentivized exploration via loot, shortcuts, and bonfires. Stealth is a great addition to it. (With that said, stealth is not perfect---for example, escaping to higher ground and/or reentering stealth can trivialize encounters, and is almost incenvitized in the game as this is the most efficient way to traverse zones without losing Healing Gourd stock.)\n\nAn especially impressive level is Ashina Castle. I was mindblown just how the subzones were interconnected as I opened shortcuts. My jaw dropped when I opened the secret human-shadow door at Ashina Castle only to arrive at the Dilapidated Temple. Other examples are Ashina Castle's Old Grave and Ashina Outskirts; and Ashina Reservoir and Abandoned Dungeon.\n\n__Aesthetics.__ Beautiful environments, face models, enemy designs, level designs. However, speaking technically for the engine, it's not at the top compared to AAA titles like God of War, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, and Devil May Cry 5. Music scores are also only servicable and ultimately forgettable. Atmosphere does not really exist as most gameplay occurs in well-lit outdoors.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Freedom of movement with jump and its interactivity with walls and hook shot. Exploration feels a lot tighter, particularly as these movements feel seamless with the interactions with the environment through simple \"dots\" as cues. The dots indicate talk ability for NPCs, eavesdropping, open/close entrances, and locations to grapple hook.\n+ This is parry done right, better than the original of Demon's Souls, and better than the previous best iteration which is Bloodborne. Missing deflects are more forgiving, getting deflects is easier, and chaining deflects to increase enemy posture gets at a parry system far more complex than any of the other parry-then-riposte games.\n+ Eavesdropping is seamless where you press a button to on-demand listen, not have to wait a while which can be more realistic but tedious as in MGSV.\n+ No endurance bar; poise is upgraded to be a core bar. Instead of attack-then-dodge, the core mechanic is effectively parries where you make opportunities to attack by timing precisely when they attack, not after they finish attacking.\n+ Combat Arts are excellently done as it's only one additional move. This lets you perfect the minimalistic mechanics while still being able to utilize situational attacks like the Combat Arts, Prosthetic, and holding down R1.\n+ Deathblows feel extremely satisfying and well-animated as part of the combat.\n+ Aside from the ending choice, there are no missable and awkward pathing for NPC sidequests and items like Dark Souls dragon tails! This, and no illusory walls, makes the game so much more of a joy to play without a guide.\n+ When you pick up items, the game pauses and you see the item description. This lets you take the time to read what you pick up. This avoids two situations that frequently happen in Dark Souls: you pick up an item, but are too lazy to go to the inventory to read the description (it involves ~5-7 keypresses); you're in the midst of battle and frantically picking up items and forget what you picked up.\n+ Native language for voice acting is Japanese!\n+ Certain (mini)boss encounters enable situational use of your grapple, which complexifies gameplay.\n+ Love the idea of Demon Bell. Perhaps I'll try it in addition to New Game Plus on an additional playthrough.\n+ Runbacks to all bosses are short.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ No multiplayer.\n+ Prosthetic tool, most similar to Bloodborne's situational left hand weapon.\n+ Currency system of both gold and experience. Only experience is lost after death, and cannot be regained.\n+ Strong attack is relegated from a core button (R2) to a very situational thrust (hold down R1).\n+ Fast travel at all Sculptor's Idols, similar to Dark Souls 3.\n+ There are limited-time buff consumables based around Sugars, similar to previous Souls games' lightning/fire weapon buffs. (I never use them as they both require farming and reduce the difficulty of hard encounters.)\n+ You can't fall to your death (most of the time). You only take damage.\n+ You can't accidentally or otherwise harm NPCs in the hub.\n+ For the first time in a Souls-like game, the menu pauses the game(!).\n+ You can swim!\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Resurrection and half XP/Sen taken upon death. Resurrection seems unnecessarily player-friendly, and Unseen Aid so unlikely even with zero Dragon Rot that it's unreliable to rely upon, let alone have in the game. I prefer Souls/Bloodborne's death penalty of finding your corpse or killing the enemy who took your Blood Echoes. Enemies camping your corpse is especially a bad mechanic. I do like the lore for resurrection though.\n+ Rot. Rot is unfairly punishing---it doesn't cause NPC storylines to be permanently missable, but there's only a finite number of times to heal from it. Due to the expensive rot system, I just treat resurrection as a permanent way to not lose out on XP and Sen by calling my Homeward Bone item everytime I die (this works for everything except bosses). I also explicitly must choose not to pursue NPC sidequests and restore Dragonrot until after bosses when I'm on a trek to complete a slew of NPC sidequests.\n+ Unlike other Souls games, you manually hold X to pick up Sen instead of getting it automatically like you do with Souls and Blood Echoes. And it has an animation of a vacuum, which feels out of place.\n+ Few (if any!) enemies punish you for broken posture. You only get punished by taking an attack if they're in the middle of one. This incentivizes deflects/blocking even more as the punishment is not that bad.\n+ Locking out bosses (and an entire zone!) due to the choice of ending is a cheap incentive for players to replay the game.\n+ Treasure Carp don't respawn. It's Demon's Souls' Crystal Lizards all over again.\n+ You need a limited-quantity Divine Confetti consumable (limitless only late in game, and restricted to certain ending choices) in order to fight two mini-boss classes: Headless and Shichimen Warrior. This limits the number of attempts you do, which is tedious.\n+ Sekiro is almost too obvious in being prescriptive, from tutorials to redundant exposition to make sure players recall previous events, and a few too many hints on where to go next. In addition, Memos and items passed to NPCs which only trigger a lore reaction don't age well given the internet. In previous games, completionists are incentivized to complete NPC sidequests in order to get unique items such as armor sets. Not many NPC sidequests offer such uniques.\n+ No borderless. No ultrawidescreen support.\n\n## References and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/Sekiro/\n+ https://sekiroshadowsdietwice.wiki.fextralife.com\n+ http://www.wsgf.org/dr/sekiro-shadows-die-twice/en\n+ stealthbr | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPDmyO4oqq4\n\nMy total playtime according to Steam is 33 hours, beating the base game in 32 hours (I unknowingly chose the Shura ending, which adds two unique bosses Emma and Issin Ashina in replacement for Owl, real Corrupted Monk, Fountainhead Palace, Sakura Bull of the Palace mini-boss, Great Colored Carp, Shichimen Warrior mini-boss, Divine Dragon, Shigekichi of the Red Guard mini-boss, Demon of Hatred, and Isshin the Sword Saint.

    "comments": "Bloodborne stands out among its spiritual predecessors with its unique gothic horror theme, enriched with its own lore, rich environments, and a variety of excellent level designs and enemies suited to its theme. Gameplay-wise, Bloodborne shines most in its aggressive style---with a larger emphasis on sidesteps, parries, and rolls rather than shielding and timing enemy attacks. It sets the precedent for Dark Souls III but continues even further in aggressivity via its firearm-parrying mechanics, no blocking, and rally. Personally, I prefer Dark Souls and Nioh mechanics with the less aggressive playstyle. However, after adjusting for Bloodborne, I certainly very much appreciate the style. The game really makes you learn how to parry, especially for huge-health enemies with slow attacks like Executioners where it would be impractical to widdle down their health with normal attacks.\n\nUnfortunately, Bloodborne's major flaw is that it shares Demon's Souls-like mechanics as an exercise in tedium: required farming due to the Blood Vial and Quicksilver Bullet replenishment system, a hub that must be teleported to for any leveling/respawning of enemies without any middle-zone checkpoints, and long load times. Weapon and armor variety is also lacking, and NPC sidequests are forgettable. In addition, Bloodborne suffers from many typical Souls flaws: contrived side quest pathing, occasionally lengthy runbacks to bosses, and the upgrade system requires commiting to a specific weapon or otherwise tedious farming.\n\n__Story.__ Excellent minimalism as always. I especially love the world-changing dynamic upon killing Rom, and how Cathedral Ward changes after killing Vicar Amelia. NPC sidequests are lacking unfortunately though compared to other Souls games, where the characters are iconic.\n\n__Combat/Gameplay__. Uniquely, Bloodborne has several aspects distinguishing itself from other FromSoftware games: most notably, trick weapons, no blocking, rally, and a non-replenishible healing consumable. See discussion in details below.\n\nBloodborne inherits much from Dark Souls which I enjoy, e.g., strong/weak attacks, falling attack, jump attack, backstab, death, checkpoints, player messages on the ground, weapon variety and viability. Overall, what I really like about Souls games (and Bloodborne included) is its emphasis on combat mechanics. I suffered brutally in Central Yharnam against the villager mobs, Executioners, and Father Gascoigne. Then I adapted to the aggressivity and learning the movesets to calmly pace my action.\n\nLevel-wise, I especially love Central Yharnam which feels like a real town (IMO, even better than Dark Souls III's Undead Parish); Hemwick Channel Lane which is maddening in its excellent use of lighting; Cainhurst Castle for its derelicht medieval feeling; Upper Cathedral Ward for its perfect ensemble of lighting, horror music, and enemy sounds.\n\n__Aesthetics/Sound__. Environments are gorgeous. Enemy varieties are all haunting. Boss designs are decent---can occasionally be your generic beast trope however as is common in the Souls series.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Simplicity of stats: vitality, endurance, strength/skill/bloodtinge/arcane. I would personally do without bloodtinge to simplify further, as it's specific to firearms and 3 particular weapons. I do understand however that this removes build variety and therefore replayability, similar to Bloodborne's lack of weapon and armor variety.\n+ Trick weapons enable more weapon moveset variety and is better in my opinion than Dark Souls 3's approach of Weapon Arts, which introduces yet a third bar to manage (Focus bar). I also think it's better than Nioh's stances, which is too complex over the Trick Weapon's bimodal nature.\n+ Parry via shooting firearm followed by visceral attack (riposte). I love that parry is part of timing an offensive attack, and not like Dark Souls which requires a passive shield movement.\n+ Rally which offers health replenishment via an aggressive risk/reward mechanic of attacking immediately back. It most reminds me of Nioh's Ki Pulse, which is a similar risk/reward tactic for staying close to the enemy and being aggressive, reducing the time window when they'll attack so you can successfully dodge away.\n+ There are still some illusory walls, which requires looking up but fortunately only in Chalice Dungeons.\n+ The werewolf in the beginning and dying is a nice callback to Demon's Souls tutorial boss. Same goes with The One Reborn following the concept of Demon Souls' Tower Knight.\n+ Scurrying Beasts don't have as ridiculous hitboxes as Crystal Lizards, and can vary in size.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ No equipment or item weight.\n+ No blocking/guarding.\n+ Backstabs require a long windup. This makes them infeasible for combat outside of sneaking up on enemies.\n+ Lamps often form more as a hub point similar to Demon's Souls rather than than as checkpoints across a zone similar to Dark Souls' bonfires. This can make badly designed levels a trudge to go through. On the other hand, it forces better level design as the player only ever spawns from select locations.\n+ Blood Echoes are often taken by a nearby enemy; unlike in Dark Souls, you don't typically just pick them up from your corpse. This means you can't run through enemies to get your corpse, or trial it out with a tough enemy over many instances.\n+ Icons are in color palette with the environment unlike Dark Souls; for example, messages are not orange and Wandering Madnesses are not sparkly and blue like Crystal Lyzards.\n+ Bloodtapping to quickly gain Quicksilver Bullets at the cost of health.\n+ Unlike Dark Souls, there's only one item shortcut, on top of the healing consumable shortcut.\n+ Convenants. They're wearable to easily swap, which ultimately Dark Souls III did too.\n+ Caryll Runes serve as the passive stat boost analogous to the Estus Flask Shard and Sublime Bone Dust of Dark Souls.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Healing consumable (Blood Vial) must be farmed and only restock after death from farmed Blood Vials in your storage. Same holds for Quicksilver Bullets. I greatly prefer the Dark Souls approach which prescribes a fixed number of Estus Flasks; this essentially determines the difficulty as otherwise just farming and using 20 Blood Vials per boss makes encounters significantly easier. This combined with long load times and occasionally long runbacks to bosses make fighting them extremely frustrating. To alleviate this major game flaw, I back up my save state to a USB/Online (which has all the Blood Vials/Quicksilver Bullets); then I restore the backup if I fail. At the least, it avoids having to farm all over again.\n+ Chalice dungeons are monotonous and root versions especially not worth playing. Chalice dungeons replicate too many assets to not have nearly as much atmosphere and be diverse as real levels. They are exercises in tedium because the layout and enemies are predictable (particularly Depths 1-3). This style of loot-grindy gameplay fits an action RPG like Diablo where procedurally generated rogue-like maps is the purpose. Here, however, it significantly deviates from Bloodborne's artistic and singular direction. If it were purely for the endgame, then forcing players to go through the first deleveled zones  is especially annoying.\n+ Must travel to Hunter's Dream for leveling, going to different zones, or respawning enemies for farming. This combined with the need to farm (e.g., due to nonreplenishible Blood Vials) makes the game feel tedious.\n+ Insight as a second currency, and of a finite amount in each playthrough. Not only are there still missable items/side quests in this game, you can lose out on permanent Insight from Brainsuckers.\n+ Unlike Dark Souls 2+, there is no respeccing.\n+ Blood gems as an additional upgrade option to weapons. That's fine in and of itself, but the RNG mechanics in getting the right one, and the fact that only +% physical damage is useful, makes blood gems a pain to use.\n+ Coop requires using 1 Insight, which is a very limited-quantity item and essentially discourages its use for most scenarios.\n+ Long load times, including after dying.\n+ Times for running back to bosses can be long.\n+ Unlike Dark Souls 2+, you enter New Game Plus immediately after completing the game.\n+ Weapons have durability and must be repaired. It just feels tedious particularly as there is no blacksmith lore unlike Dark Souls. While simplifying too much can detrimentally make a game too streamlined off its RPG elements, I find weapon durability to be a poor mix as one may as well also include armor durability.\n+ No armor is really upgraded over the game. I used the Hunter set from beginning to end of the game as nothing ever beat its defensive attributes.\n+ Winter Lanterns are a broken enemy. Accumulating Frenzy even after you kill them is extremely annoying.\n\n## References and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne\n+ https://zkjellberg.github.io/bloodborne-cheat-sheet/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/3u5pdq/beginner_quality_build/\n+ lore videos from vaati vidya, itself basically copying the community-favorite Paleblood Hunt | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjWOy6ioVHI\n+ videogamedunkey | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSOuLJtDRFA\n\nI purchased a PS4 specifically for this game. (That said, there are quite a few other exclusives that I can now play given that I'm purchasing the PS4: Uncharted Trilogy+Uncharted 4; The Last of Us; God of War; Spider Man; Last Guardian; Horizon Zero Dawn; Ratchet and Clank; Shadow of the Tomb Raider; Red Dead Redemption 2; Spyro Reignited Trilogy; Batman Arkham remastered; Assassin's Creed II trilogy remastered;.) Given emulation standards for PS3 which only recently had a breakthrough in 2017, itâs unlikely weâll see progress for PS4 until, say, 2025. In contrast, Xbox One has literally zero exclusives that I want to play; and I can get a Nintendo Switch for their exclusives later too. The only other option is PS Now, which has more limited features and can be unacceptable in bandwidth/input lag; at best, it's only a PS4 engine streamed to PC.\n\nMy total playtime according to Bloodborne is 24 hours, beating the base game in 24 hours (does not include DLC or last part of Hunter's Dream). (Note this omits hours I played to attempt boss encounters as I reloaded the game state for every boss.) I chose Military Veteran as my Origin as it allocated least stats to Bloodtinge and Arcane, Threaded Cane, and Hunter Pistol. I went for a quality build in order to utilize both Strength and Skill weapons, allocating enough Vitality/Endurance in the beginning before I could be a bit more flexible in allocations across the 4 stats. I completed all chalice dungeons and encountered only a subset of the bosses.\n\ntodos\n\n+ missed completing eileen the crow's questline; young girl and older sister\n+ all runes\n+ all messenger items\n+ use insight to purchase all armor sets and blood rocks\n+ graveguard set?",

    "comments": "Nioh has great core mechanics with its own non-Souls opinions. Combat is crisp with certain unique elements such as Ki Pulse, stances, and a MMO looting system. The Japanese folklore is excellent. Levels are well-designed. Enemy mechanics are a blast to learn. Overall, Nioh is fun as a challenging action RPG with a lot of (albeit repetitive) content.\n\nPlaying Nioh makes me better appreciate what makes Dark Souls so great. Unlike Dark Souls, Nioh lacks good (and diegetic) storytelling, level design variety, unique enemies/bestiary designs and enemy variety, equipment cosmetic variety, and music. Variety is especially an issue: after 6-7 missions when you enter the third region, 90% of the enemies have already been shown and I already mastered their mechanics. Each mission feels forgettable as you brainlessly go to the next.\n\n__Story.__ It's mediocre. Most progression is followed from cutscenes before and after missions, as well as walls of text in the world map. The story isn't integrated into the gameplay.\n\nMoreover, the story by itself isn't very good. It seems as if it were any other Samurai tale with Yokai and key epic heroes such as Oda Nobunaga and tropes. For a primarily Japanese setting and lore, I'm also deeply disturbed by the need to westernize the game by making the protagonist English and with a UK background. It reminds me of The Last Samurai in its level of yellow fever cringe. Nioh fans are quick to point that this is based off a true story, but it's also the case that Nioh developers could have chosen any distinguished samurai for the tale. It's naive to think otherwise that they didn't pick a white samurai for the audience in the same way Rachel in Ninja Gaiden was developed.\n\n__Combat.__ Man do the core mechanics play so much like Dark Souls, especially Dark Souls 3 in pacing: one weak and strong attack; dodge roll; D-pad consumables (but Demon's Souls style in consumable heal instead of Estus Flasks); Dark Souls elevator mechanics; no jump; falling attack; guard (and which halts endurance gain if you hold it); parry. Other gameplay mechanics are also similar: universal difficulty; heal and endurance bars; enemies stagger; infinite inventory but limited equipped weight (and weight tiers); checkpoints via a landmark (here, shrines); coop and deaths; gestures; picking up corpse to get back souls (Amrita) after death; Summoner's Candle (Nioh version of Ring of Sacrifice); a predilection for smashing boxes to find hidden item-holding corpses/Kodama. Even boss names during fights have a Demon's Souls-like font.\n\nTeam Ninja does add certain unique differences: most notably, Ki Pulse, Stances, viewing enemy stamina bars and the finisher moves, the Skill Tree, and the loot system. Ki Pulses (and Yokai realms) provide a deliberate combat pace, very different to the core of Dark Souls' mantra of punish-then-dodge-roll. However, it seems backward to have to shift your eyes to monitor the top-left screen while in the middle of battle. Stances work well situationally for certain weapon types more than others. With the loot system, items vary in level, rarity, damage/defense multiplier, and attributes. There's a huge amount of loot. I think the concept is interesting for a single player RPG. But it can be too much to organize, where most upgrades feel like stat scaling while the aesthetics don't change. (In contrast, Dark Souls does an excllent job at aesthetics and offering set pieces jointly when picking them up from corpses.)\n\nIt's unfortunate that the environments and enemy variety is so paltry. It also suffers from Dark Souls 1's cheap tricks of palette swaps and overusing bosses (fine in only occassional cases).\n\n__Aesthetics.__ I'm surprisingly disappointed by its graphics given its 2017 setting. Certain still shots can be impressive. But they remain lackluster overall, and the face models have jarring geometry for a 2017 game. Dark Souls III is infinitely more impressive and that was developed in 2015. Nioh's music also remains forgettable and cutscenes are often limited in frames in a visual-novel esque way.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ No missable content, especially dialogue options or sequencing as is the craziness of Souls games. The only ones are Kodama (can revisit area), Samurai/Ninja/Onmyo Locks (can just farm Skill Points and/or revisit area), and Nurikabe (appear in only two levels) which are not strictly necessary.\n+ Sprinting feels more weighty and real than Dark Souls. I found myself incorporating sprinting into my gameplay. It's like dodges, but more controllable and uses less stamina. Moreover, dashes replace dodge rolls as the main mechanic: dodge rolls in Nioh require a double-tap press and dodges in  general have a much smaller window for i-frames, only in the start of the dodge. They also outline the # of Kodama when starting a mission, and tell you when you get them all. There's an extreme level of satisfaction in obtaining all of them purely by exploration, and without a guide.\n+ Nioh encourages experimenting with all weapon types. Unlike Dark Souls which requires commiting to STR or DEX, Nioh has stats which only weakly contribute to overall damage output and titles/proficiency, which incentivizes using them all. And I thoroughly enjoyed playing with most all the weapons.\n+ No durability.\n+ Revenants to fight player deaths. Clear improvement over Bloodstains! Unlike Dark Souls' Bloodstains, player corpses can't be used to see how they died (it was generally useless anyways; all that mattered was seeing the corpse).\n+ Runs to boss fights are always short.\n+ Kappas are not missable and don't have ridiculous hitboxes unlike Dark Souls' Crystal Lizards.\n+ Endgame. It includes New Game Plus and the Abyss with continual hp/damage scaling not unlike Dark Souls. A specific feature I especially like about Nioh is that you can freely switch difficulty levels across missions. This avoids Dark Souls' annoyance of having to commit to a new difficulty level and never getting old ones back.\n+ Zones (missions/sub-missions) have recommended levels.\n+ All the missions are generally spot-on in terms of frequency of checkpoints and overall cohesiveness in connecting areas together (e.g., locked doors, which are infinitely better than Dark Souls' occasional cheap trick at cohesion through locked elevators).\n+ Unlike Dark Souls, chests cannot be accidentally destroyed from attacks.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ All the various passives: Guardian Spirit (and with their own level system!), Kodama Blessings, Clans (which are Nioh's version of Covenents, without Dark Souls' integration to levels and unique items, and ranks). It adds more complexity, but removing them could also be too streamlined like WoW.\n+ MMO items with rarity, affixes, and crafting system.\n+ You can see your enemy's stamina bar.\n+ There's a noise whenever an enemy aggros. This gives you a few second heads-up on archers and ambushes.\n+ Specific weapon slots for melee and range.\n+ Less \"Souls\" items on corpses, which other loot instead.\n+ Unlike Dark Souls, dialogue with an actual story.\n+ No PvP invasions.\n+ No huge reliance on backstabs like in Dark Souls.\n+ Titles.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Many weapon types don't have a distinguishing reason for using the Strong vs Weak attack. I typically only use strong attacks situationally when stabbing the enemy when they run out of stamina. Certain weapon types do at least utilize weak vs strong attack well by distinguishing a piercing thrust vs sweep (Spear), or Kurasagami's Strong Attack which is a really long range thrust and can hit many enemies in a line. For swords, it would be nice if they simply had a horizontal vs vertical slash. Same goes for fully utilizing the variety from three stances, where only weapons such as the Odachi distinguish between horizontal vs vertical slash.\n+ Skill tree, Agyo/Ungyo prestige, and fighting type-style variety in the moveset. I'm just not a fan of fighting games and the zillion of move variations; I like when a game shows mastery over a core set of moves like Dark Souls.\n+ Sub-missions enable more content but are redundant in level design, with minor variations in enemy placement and blocking off zones. The huge amount of redunancy makes sub-missions feel like artificial methods to stretch the total playtime of the game.\n+ Guardian spirits' living weapon. They're rare high-damage, which lets you EZ mode bosses and any difficult encounters. I find them to be a useless quandary---it helps progress faster, but it feels cheap as you don't learn from the encounter if you do use it.\n+ Parrying is not good in this game.\n+ Environments don't seem to be designed to occlude weapon interactions often. In Dark Souls, horizontal strikes would often bounce off walls and force you to be more considerate of your environment. Nioh does this well with Yokai realms but could take Dark Souls' cue of defining more areas in a level to encourage variety of gameplay strategies.\n+ Gold and Glory as extra currencies.\n+ Lack of open world. The map menu as the main entrypoint feels lazy; it makes the game feel more disjointed.\n+ Online interaction. Unlike Dark Souls, no soapstone messages. Summon signs are also not available so you have to actively look for interaction via offering a limited-quantity item.\n+ Zones scale quite highly in levels. This makes older zones way too easy for a given level. Dark Souls had less of this problem as there was not that much of a level disparity across zones.\n+ Radar. I never use it. Unnecessary GUI.\n+ Nioh developers sometimes just shit on you with random two boss enemy style characters like multiple tengus.\n+ Guard is omnidirectional. It removes a skill in the game to make sure your guard is facing the archer while fighting off a melee enemy.\n+ The sort order in the inventory is different for each item. This is incredibly annoying to have to change the sort order to be identical across items for consistency. I have the same issue with MGS V Phantom Pain which does this for all the comrades.\n+ No ultrawide support. It doesn't even support cropped aspect ratios with black borders. If I played without the fanmade fix, I would have to move my game to a new workspace and with my wallpaper specifically set to a nonintrusive backgruound.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/Nioh\n+ https://nioh.wiki.fextralife.com/Nioh+Wiki\n+ starter build | https://www.reddit.com/r/Nioh/comments/5u9meg/tips_build_nioh_starter_guide_for_first_build_to/\n+ skills tree passives | https://www.reddit.com/r/Nioh/comments/5sycdo/psa_you_gain_the_benefits_from_passives_in_other\n+ prestige guide | https://www.reddit.com/r/Nioh/comments/5v0y1v/prestige_guide_on_what_to_take/\n+ dissassemble vs offer vs sell old items | https://www.reddit.com/r/Nioh/comments/8raxpo/new_player_here_wondering_if_i_should/\n+ fanmade 16:9 aspect ratio patch | http://www.wsgf.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=64&t=32376, https://github.com/LennardF1989/NiohResolution\n+ impressions | https://www.reddit.com/r/Sekiro/comments/aa3pv2/just_finished_up_nioh/\n+ divine gear guide | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRr8FFRYwKI\n+ general resources reddit thread | https://www.reddit.com/r/Nioh/comments/6u8x4y/the_kodamas_directories_your_onestop_thread_for/\n+ top affixes | https://www.reddit.com/r/Nioh/comments/5uzqho/top_affixs_what_to_aim_for, https://www.reddit.com/r/Nioh/comments/74fll1/help_with_kingo_build_in_wotd\n+ affixes guide | https://www.reddit.com/comments/8pbj11\n\nI picked it up because of its \"Souls\" inspiration; relatedness to the upcoming Sekiro from From Software which aims to be the next game following Dark Souls III; generally high review scores; and my curiosity of how Ninja Gaiden developers would fuse their origins with Souls mechanics.\n\nMy total playtime according to Steam is 47 hours, beating the base game in 47 hours at level 96 (does not include DLC). To avoid spoilers, I only went back to a mission following a walkthrough to pick up any missing Kodama and locks. I completed all missions/submissions in the order of recommended level, and ended up skipping sub-missions in the latter half. In April 2020 when picking up the game to play the DLC, I refreshed myself by completing all sub-missions except the two boss missions.\n\nI played a build with very loose stats. It seems like recommendations on community discussions like Reddit are that builds don't matter for the first playthrough in any case; respec is always possible. So I played varying stats so I could try all weapons. Armor-wise, I like light/medium sets. This is not done for the immersion (I actually find the ninja archetype cringeworthy) but because video games like this and Souls series generally encourage aggressive dodging over defensive blocking styles. Dying in a few hits forces better gameplay. Weapon-wise, I switched types every mission in order to get an appreciation of the variety (and which is incenvitized in game via titles). My favorites are Katana, Dual Katana, Odachi, Spear, Tonfa. I use Ninjutsu for ranged attacks, Onmyo magic for Talismans, and rarely if ever Ranged weapons. Skill-wise, I never use special movesâI allocated all my points to passive bonusesâand I never use Living Weapon.\n\ntodos\n+ Gestures.\n+ All Kodamas.\n+ Defiled Castle: Give total of 20 Dung Balls for trophy.\n+ Way of the Strong\n+ Abyss\n+ Twilight mission",

    "comments": "Devil May Cry 5 may very well be the best in the series, defining the iconic themes that make the series so successful. Over-the-top action, rock music, stylistically playful. Cheesy dialogue. Fanservice bitches. Even the the simple but in medias res, multiple perspectives storyline is great. Excellent core mechanics for a hack and slash. Devil May Cry 5 newly features the overly cool, apathetic, gothic Vie. He suits the series really well while remaining a distinct character: love that he acknowledges whenever he won't beat someone; clearly more humble than the cocky Dante and Nero. Excellent visuals with face models and rendered urban and hellish environments. Even the supporting characters are hilarious: the mechanic Nico, Vie's bird.\n\n__Combat.__ While a very different style, I personally prefer Dark Souls' combat mechanics. Each fight is more meaningful as every enemy has the possibility to kill you in a few hits (therefore requiring you to understand each enemy's mechanics). I also like its pace, although I can appreciate DmC's style of learning fight move abilities which you can slowly start to master. DmC's combat is more brainless, as part of its arcade roots: scores, loot randomly in a map, and instanced fights. Scores in a fight encourage the core of Devil May Cry combat, which is variety, utilizing as many unique moves as possible.\n\nI personally prefer Vie > Dante > Nero. Vie is just unique in managing multiple players, and fully utilizing its combos without D-pad mastery: Shadow and the bird to combo attacks, Vie to finish attacks, read book for Devil Trigger, and to launch Nightmare. I didn't like Nero's consumable Devil Breaker and could fold it into a natural gameplay.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Pre-viz live action cutscenes as an option. I've never seen this in a game before. It's both hilarious and a fascinating view of behind-the-scenes.\n+ Subtle sign of co-op which is nonintrusive but still a fun detail.\n+ Dante's Jackson Five dance randomly in the latter half of the game.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ No ultrawidescreen support.\n+ I got A and S ranks for all missions.

    "comments": "Senua's greatest strengths are its auteristic visuals, with no HUD, minimalistic controls, and psychotic atmosphere. Lighting. Camera angles. It's MGS-style in its seamless transitions of gameplay and cinematic. So many amazing scenes---reminded me of when I would play Dark Souls Remastered and be stricken in awe at the environments: the beginning rowing, the firey hell, the hands in the Sea of Corpses. Its core weaknesses lie in its superficial gameplay. Movement within areas is standard but lacks most interactivity which keeps the environments feeling more restricted with boundaries, almost like a walking simulator. Puzzles are interesting the first time and quickly become an exercise in tedium. Combat is only serviceable. Enemy variety is countable on your hand. Dark Souls not only had better mechanics but also a better story and level design.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Stereo whispers. ASMR level.\n+ No tutorial.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Combat is weighty but more servicable than great. It feels like a forced form of interaction. I do like that the two bosses differ in tactics: fire boss requires dodge-rolls; raven boss requires blocks, which block his ranged and fast weak attacks. FOr the combat, I like that the parries are more or less automatic if you block weak attacks, and Focus is a fun occasional power-up. The combat is almost too slow however, even slower in its methodical behavior than Dark Souls 2. Constant and automatic lock-on targeting can be a hinderance.\n+ Permadeaths losing game save state as a bluff and not actually real. The Kick/Melee combat didn't seem necessary---I only ever felt compelled to use it on the single Barbarian enemy with a shield.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Puzzles. They're a silly game of pattern recognition. I just don't like puzzles in general. I do like the encouragement of exploration though. I found them so tedious overall that I ended up following a walkthrough for the majority of the puzzles after the first two zones.\n+ I'm only ever in danger when I'm in combat pulling out my sword. This saps some of my expectations as I'm not afraid of the atmosphere randomly killing me/shocking me.\n+ The many camera shots with Senua facing the camera feels a little too tryhard.

LLove that it set ups core rhythms, and then tests your skill. All failures are your own. You're proud as you learn mechanics as the game progresses. Unlike other rhythm games which give a score, the requirement of (roughly) perfect execution requires that you really master the mechanics. It reminds me of speedruns and Dark Souls boss fights/level progressions, where you just have to finish the zone once perfectly. God damn that lsat level 6-X Pulse. It's not only long but with all sorts of tricks that just have to adapt to: the square in the beginning, the 3 consequetive squares at the end.. I literally have to play the beginning sequence (including the square) blind so I can follow the beat.",

    "comments": "Yakuza Kiwami is unfortunately too serious for its strengths (Japanese quirkiness and minigame sidestories). Its story lacks character depth and a more interesting narrative: the girl Haruka is just not as interesting as the other characters of Yakuza 0 (Makoto was arguably as bad as Haruka, but fortunately had a more interesting tale around her and did not involve multiple fetch quests to save her once she inevitably gets kidnapped again); Yakuza 0's Tachibana and Oda are better characters than Yakuza Kiwami's Florist and Date. I already found Yakuza 0's story well-executed for complementing Yakuza's core strengths but not great by itself. Yakuza Kiwami suffers by relying more on the main story than the comedy, minigames, and substories. With the same map layout and fewer minigames/substories, Kamurucho overall doesn't feel alive. For example, while it has the same number of substories, the substory characters don't connect back to an overarching city minigame like Yakuza 0's Real Estate and Cabaret Club. In addition, the subplots with the Florist's son, and Date's daughter, are unnecessary for a story that's already made very short.\n\nWhy did they have to kill Reina? Seems unnecessarily edgy and dark..Also, making Jingu (basically a random person in the Yakuza lore) Haruka's father is dissapointing. It would have been more interesting to make it Nishikiyama. They killed a lot of people in this game in general, e.g., Sera, Shinji, Kazuma, the Omi Alliance villain, Nishikiyama, Jingu, Yumi. And of course they had to make the cucking husband the main villain. The finale is especially ridiculous in the monologues and contrivances. The love pentagon with Kiryu, Nishikiyama, Yumi, Reina, and Jingu is especially stupid.\n\nIn terms of details, this game feels like a successor to Yakuza 0 rather than a remastered version of the first entry to the Yakuza 0 series. Fighting is the same (and slightly refined with the Kiwami power action), menu is the same, locations and NPC AI are the same, characters are the same.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Most of the details that I like, am ambivalent about, and dislike from Yakuza 0 also appear in Yakuza Kiwami. Here, I only describe details unique to Yakuza Kiwami.\n+ With abilities to upgrade, they affect all styles rather than just one. This makes it easier to manage your budget rather than force oneself to commit to a style.\n+ Given the 10 year skip, Kiryu now carries a cell phone. He can save using the cell phone.\n+ After a fight ends, the screen freezes and turns blue. This feels more polished to me than Yakuza 0's color just flipping to turn negative.\n+ When fighting Majima, he has the same fighting styles and heat moves as in Yakuza 0 when you played him.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ It's not only Yakuza 0's game engine but exactly the same Kamurocho game map as Yakuza 0's. I don't know if I like that familiarity or am too bored of the redundancy.\n+ No score breakdown after thug fights on the street. This removes one arcade element of Yakuza. In general, I'm ambivalent about whether Yakuza should keep its arcade roots (like its brawler-style fighting) or drop it.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ You spend experience points rather than money to gain abilities. This effectively acts as a second currency, and I realize I don't actually spend the real Yen on anything substantial: healing consumables and others are inexpensive.\n+ I greatly prefer the AV cards found across the city than thee generic locker key. The former uniquely stamps one's own as a Yakuza game.\n+ While the game plays in ultrawide screen (21:9), the cutscenes still assume 16:9 aspect ratio.\n+ Everyone has a constant frown as the typical face expression. Man that's got to hurt to keep wearing it. It makes cutscenes feel overly static and dull.\n+ Ten years pass and yet all the character models remain exactly the same. Even the city and its culture remain the same. Very few things change--you would hope they would take the ten years to refine mannerisms, personalities, etc. Why not reduce the amount to 2 or 5 years?\n\n## References and Miscellanea\n\n+ guides | https://www.neoseeker.com/yakuza-kiwami/walkthrough, https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps4/181171-yakuza-kiwami/faqs/75194\n+ differences between yakuza kiwami (2016) and yakuza (2005) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XN74qYFV-7I\n\nI played it on Windows on its release date of Feb 19 2019.

    "comments": "I like that it plays like a cinematic movie. The linear storytelling suits the novel adaptation very well. The lighting with the use of flashlights/lighters, gas masks and air filters, and partial stealth adds to the drab atmosphere. That said, the story isn't stellar by itself. It's only the interesting combination of gameplay interactivity that makes games like this better than mediocre. Overall, I'm just not invested in the game. Perhaps I'm not a fan of the FPS genre itself---I couldn't get into the Half-Life, Call of Duty, or Halo series. If it weren't for my personal tastes maybe I would rate this game higher for applying the MGS-like cinematic treatment to FPS. However, the silent protagonist, and lack of any character depth to the supporting characters, makes the game feel like moving from point A to point B most times. This is the same issue I have with Half-life and Halo which are too linear, shooting enemies in point A and then shooting enemies in point B (contrast this with DOOM (2016)'s approach to level design).\n\nThe survival setting pits you well against monsters and bands of humans alike. The game encourages exploration but not to the extent that you'll miss a permanent item if you don't explore enough: only consumables such as ammo.\n\nMetros are unfortunately redundant in assets and level design. So it's boring arriving at a new on at each new rest stop. All levels feel roughly homogenous and more of the same.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Minimal UI.\n+ Journal entries as collectables. They're the only missable item and not strictly necessary as a completionist as they don't affect gameplay.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Ammo as the universal currency, and which can be scarce. I don't like the idea of ammo management, even if it's realistic. It comes across as tedious gameplay.\n\n## References and Miscellanea\n\nI played the Redux version. I was originally motivated by Metro Exodus coming out on the day that I started this game. They seem largely story-driven, and therefore necessary to play in release order. A big bonus is that they're only a max of 10 hours per game, and I'm also personally in for something FPS action-heavy at the moment as my last played recent games are Metal Gear Solid, Yakuza 0, and Souls games. I played Survival style on Normal difficulty. They seem most standard. Weapon-wise, I converged onto the Duplet for short range, silenced Kalash for medium range, and VSV for long range respectively.",

    "comments": "Hitman is the most replayable stealth game I've played. It's truly a sandbox with a variety of methods for assassination (including multiple within even the scripted content). I'm a big fan of its sleek, clean UI and font. The game's a beauty to immerse oneself in, especially with highest quality settings on my 21:9 3440x1440p screen. Totally beats MGS5's lack of ultrawidescreen support! I suppose it makes sense as the latest engine's game was released on November 2018. Face model integration is better than Yakuza 0.\n\n__Story.__ Basically nonexistent. It's clear it's not Hitman's strong point. In fact, given its sandbox nature, I would prefer if Hitman didn't have to make each target seem evil, and explain the motives or even who is the customer.That seems more immersive to the realism of a gun for hire.\n\n__Gameplay.__ I love the sandboxy feel unique to the modern setting for this stealth game, which is the main distinction from other games like Siphon Filter, Metal Gear Solid, Assassin's Creed and Dishonored. The use of mission stories also lets you play catered playstyles that are a blast to try out.\n\nPersonally, although I like the scripted content of Story Missions, I prefer the stealthy suit-only Silent Assassin approach---maybe occassionally with a costume change---rather than following from point A to point B in story missions. This lets me directly infiltrate an area relying only on my stealth skills.I also prefer minimal saving.\n\nI don't know how I feel with the starting items. They all tended to fill in the same archetypes of playstyle: lethal melee/ranged, nonlethal melee, and tools such as coins, lockpick, disposable scanner, poisons, and a briefcase for concealing an illegal item. The items picked up in a level didn't tend to help except for a handful which I did like, e.g., crowbar, wrench. They would be maybe more meaningful if 1. they were easier to find without already knowing the map; and 2. starting items were less clutch.\n\n__Levels.__ The level designs are all stunning, especially unique areas that don't typically appear in other games like the hospital institute in Hokkaido and suburban area of Whittleton Creek. They're all excellent, but I was especially tkaen aback by the details of Hokkaido. Certain assets just pop out. The mirror is sleak. I would totally want to relax here..\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Big fan of the ~10 hour playtime. There's only 6 levels per Hitman and Hitman 2, and you can replay them as sandboxes for contract/elusive targets mode or more challenges for replayability. I like that style of content which keeps the density of quality as high as possible while encouraging elements of replayability if you want more.\n+ Unique to other stealth games, wearing disguises just works. Hiding in plain sight is the real playstyle here.\n+ Eavesdropping for optional story misssions is smooth.\n+ Love the idea of concealed weapons.\n+ NPCs pick up guns on the ground. Great!\n+ Targets vary in ethnicity, gender, and generally cultural background. There's no political bullshit hampering this game's vision.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ No prone position.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Time-limited content: Elusive Targets game mode and seasonal missions (Snow Festival, Holiday Hoarders). Hitman 2's first expansion of the Snow Festival is no longer playable as of this date ([Feb 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/aiavlx/hitman_2_game_update_213_io_interactive)).\n+ Too many game modes and confusing business model with missions released over time. I'd rather than just know all the options and play them all at once.\n+ Manual saves and loads so you don't have to restart the mission or from the last checkpoint. This eases difficulty but emphasizes the more important part of Hitman: experimentation and exploration. While I think unlimited saves (and even any manual save) is fine for the easiest difficulty, it makes it too easy for the normal difficulty of Professional. I'd prefer that Professional and Master difficulties don't have _any_ master saves, relying only on checkpoints at most which puts emphasis on IO Interactive to design these better.\n+ Too many buttons. X for scaling/climbing; G to unlock doors/trigger events; B for dragging bodies; Space for leaving; E otherwise. Why not just make most actions E?\n+ No interrogation.\n+ When close to an NPC, the combatish dialogue can be too unrealistic. This is especially the case if you're following an NPC due to a story mission but get too close. That causes them to give a mean line while in the middle of a standard one..\n+ It's not clear what breaks the requirements for Silent Assassin.\n+ It's extremely difficult to get a \"no witnesses\" kill without going through scripted content. The alternative is to really know the weak spots during a patrol position, which requires internet research.\n+ My game kept suddenly crashing in the last level Isle. Loading previous game states seemed to work haphazardly, suddenyl crashing 1s or 10s after. It took me an hour just to bum rush to finish the mission and not have to start over.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HyJocc0AjQ. Playthroughs like this are great not just because of marveling at the high skill, but because of the interesting tactics that I learn to also incorporate. For example, shooting your silenced pistol so guards look around (similar to coin); going behind a guard and immediately moving forward as they turn around so they don't see you; throwing objects or shooting in the leg to incapacitate two guards in the way.\n+ another playthrough, with commentary | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2GJ0naJUXE\n+ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYWpf9PESbc. Sodapoppin playthrough\n+ different ways of trying to play the game | https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/hd6vq0/im_not_even_into_stealth_games_but_hitman_is/fvjqiz5\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/a2mxx3/psa_while_found_trespassing_does_not_negate/, https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/a0gnar/things_that_dont_void_silent_assassin/. \"Found Trespassing\" does not negate Silent Assassin. Searching does not. Bullet Impact Noticed does not. Compromised (e.g., seen killing), Body Found, Non-Target Kills, and getting caught on camera while not erasing evidence do. \"Suspicious\" usually does; but it does not if Suspicion activates from an enforcer during his patrol.\n\nI played for a total playtime (according to Steam) of 9 hours, just beating the base game. Afterwards I completed Patient Zero (more content but on same levels; I like them!), Escalations (they're basically Contracts but IOI-made and not time-limited like Elusive Targets; I like them!), and Sniper Assassin Mode (only one map; minigame-like level of content quality). I did not complete Contracts (player-made versions of Escalations), Elusive Targets (time-limited content), Ghost Mode (I'm not interested in multiplayer races), or Hitman 2 Expansion levels (they're not out as of my playtime, Feb 2019). I use keyboard and mouse. My first playthrough followed story missions. I chose the official recommended mission stories first as I assume they're the most interesting scripted content (https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/9wiop9/list_of_all_recommended_mission_stories_spoilers/).\n\nMy broad playstyle is non-lethal stealth, going for Silent Assassin. This means killing and intercepting as few non-targets as possible, with no witnesses, body found, or being caught; that seems to be the Hitman mantra. To lure NPCs, I use my silenced pistol, trigger NPC to question mark by staying in their range for a bit, or throw a coin. That said, I will vary this style in order to 1. see the content from what other styles look like, e.g., full Rambo, poisoning everyone's food; 2. complete challenges. My first and foremost mission is to explore to see and appreciate all content; and then achieve my primary playstyle.\n\nPlaystyles typically differ in five dimensions: stealth vs nonstealth, lethal vs nonlethal, zero vs minimal takedowns vs all takedowns (similar to Dishonored's chaos system), melee vs ranged, and resets vs no resets. For the latter two, I almost always go with no resets (to an extent, using some save points like checkpoints but never to the point of savescuming), and I don't restrict myself to melee or ranged. I also use no/immersive HUD and max difficulty after the first playthrough. My favorite playstyles for Hitman (and the stealth genre more broadly) are the following, roughly ranked.\n\n1. First playthrough (option A): _Stealth nonlethal._ You perform non-target takedowns when you need to but don't go out of your way to prevent them. This is typically more challenging than a stealth lethal playstyle (e.g., more limited toolset; guards can wake up; chokeholding can take longer than an instant kill).\n2. First playthrough (option B): _Stealth lethal._ You perform non-target takedowns when you need to but don't go out of your way to prevent them. In most games, the lethal route uses an entirely different (and often more diverse) toolset. Lethal is typically more fun due to its toolset and kill animations, but it's less challenging than nonlethal.\n3. Second+ playthrough: _\"Ghost.\"_ Zero non-target takedowns, either lethal or nonlethal on targets. Known as Silent Assassin in Hitman. In Hitman, a variant is suit-only. This is the ultimate stealth challenge and fantasy. It's often frustrating for a first playthrough as you need to familiarize yourself with the level but it's perfect on a second or third.\n4. Second+ playthrough: _Speedrun._ Complete the mission as fast as possible. Possibly with the constraint of not being detected.\n5. Miscellaneous playthrough: _Scripted._ Following scripted linear scenarios (in Hitman, story missions).\n6. Miscellaneous playthrough: _\"Genocide run.\"_ Kill everyone (typically lethal), stealth, and both melee and ranged. Fun to go on a stealthy killer rampage. Often too easy though.\n7. Miscellaneous playthrough: _Assault stealth._ \"Rambo\" style. Fun for maybe five minutes to see how the enemy AI react. But it's boring in that you ignore the point of the game.\n\nI played this Season One content from the Hitman 2 game as $20. Apparently this is a slightly remastered version based on Hitman 2's engine.",

    "comments": "MGS5 has the polish of a AAA title (for the first half), but it ultimately feels soulless---lacking in story, characters, level designs, the culture that makes the Metal Gear series dumb but fun technobabble, the movie-game hybrid theme, and rife with flaws of its new western mechanics (e.g., barebones open world and home base). With that said, what MGS5 does better than any other game in the series is advancing the philosophy of freedom of gameplay. It refines certain combat mechanics so well: this is how stealth should be done.\n\nFan consensus is that MGS5-PP has the best gameplay but lacks in story. I actually disagree that the overall gameplay is the best. Certainly MGS5's AI and combat styles are the most refined they've ever been. However, the combat quickly becomes repetitive. For example, levels lack variety as a open world environment with the same assets used across levels and any evolving content; bosses don't really exist and lack the iconic status of, e.g., Sniper Wolf, Psycho Mantis, The End, Cyborg Ninja. This offers few incentives to change up your gameplay style aside from the occasional enemy adaptation. Most importantly, the combat lacks context, without a real story and cast to drive it forward (https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/5g9n7w/mgsv_is_a_repetitive/darjoxi/). The cast and bosses are barely existent in the game, and the story itself feels incomplete due to the Konami-Kojima dispute.\n\nIn general, I also don't like these move towards western game elements: currency, platformer-style levels, scores, a home base with others you level up, silent protagonist, storytelling that only ties the missions together rather than the opposite of gameplay complementing the story.\n\n__Story.__ The prologue is set up very well, incredibly cinematic, dark, and seamless in integration as a tutorial. The rest of the story is unfortunately barebones, just stringed along as you complete a list of missions. The story that does appear such as the Zero mission is cringey in its dialogue. The majority of the story appears in cassette tapes, optional audio to listen to. This mechanic is just not good: it should be integrated into the story, not be a chore list that should be consumed. Any story that does exist is at the quality of fanfiction: Quiet and hints of romance, forgettable characters, Huey Emmerich having a child Hal with Strangelove, the zombie mission and infections in general. I feel like the game was built around a few powerful conceptual enemies: Man on Fire, Psycho Mantis, Skulls, child Liquid Snake, child soldiers; and the game fell flat to build a story around them.\n\nCharacter-wise, Snake has gone from a standalone character in previous games of the Series to a silent protagonist with little emotion. I find every dialogue with him cringey: it's so strange to have Ocelot and Snake have a \"conversation\" where Ocelot says something and Snake hardly even gestures to react. Ocelot or Miller are not distinctive in this game. Quiet is a brilliant example of just how bad the western fanservice can be---she's not even a good character if you forget about the ludicrous sexual appeal.And she is also the only one with character development. Ocelot is forgettable. Huey Emmerich is just incredibly whiny all the time---there's no variation in his emotions; the story is constantly setup to interrogate him and learn something new as he whines about it. I liked the idea of a whiny guy being a huge asshole villain in actuality; but there's no big reveal to make it interesting. We just hear the in-progress steps of him whining.\n\n__Combat.__ This is clearly the best of the Metal Gear series. The overall style of non-lethal stealth has been incredibly refined, with versatile approaches to a mission. Individual elements are refined to reflect this. For example, alerts are the best they've ever been: unlike MGS2 where you have to run away to avoid the infinite enemy respawn, you can silence enemies in Reflex mode (and which can be turned off for a mission bonus!) or incapacitate/kill all enemies in a vicinity to turn off the alert. Binoculars give you a surveillance that's more encompassing in the full screen UI minimalism than a radar.\n\nThere are many new controls to use than any other MGS game. To facilitate this, actions that used to be a single button such as knocking are now part of a larger switching scheme in which you can select an action from your D-pad followed by a L/R-movement to pick within it. This expands a single button press to up to 4 (button + up/down/left/right). I think the complexity is warranted in MGS5.\n\n__Level/Environments.__ Because of the base and list of missions, the game is unfortunately more platformer than the more RPG/arcadey elements of the other games of the series. I have mixed feelings about whether this platformer style with semi-open worlds is better than the arcadey style of MGS1/2 and the more RPG-style of MGS3.\n\nLevel-design wise, I'm surprised by the lack of variety with most gameplay being outside in arid landscapes. This is unlike MGS games which typically involve others such as jungles, urban indoors, battleships, submarines, even a cave in MGS1. Compare to the huge diversity set piece of Ground Zero's Camp Omega level. It's clear you can in fact set up open world environments that are just not outdoors with a handful of minimally set-up bases. The tutorial mission and mission 43 are excellent examples. I would prefer fewer than the 50 levels in favor of a density of more variety and interesting missions/designs. Level 34 is emblematic of this repetitiveness: it's literally a previous level but set to extreme difficulty. Multiple such levels occur in the second half.\n\nI also think the open-world environment is overly praised when it also suffers from the same problem other games using this mechanic do: quantity over quality (https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2015/09/09/metal-gear-solid-v-and-the-witcher-3-both-suffer-from-the-same-big-flaw/). I much prefer a higher density of content whereas MGS5's missions string together patches of content within an illusion of a much larger map that you have to run to. There is only the occassional medicinal herb shrubbery and animal. There's low variety in level assets to encourage exploration.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Love the seamless integration of binoculars as a way to scan the land before continuing. There are explicit game incentives (constant tracking of enemies) that makes the mechanic not only add to the realism but be encouraged through the gameplay mechanics.\n+ The addition of a stealth stance on top of prone.\n+ The lack of quantitative numbers: stealth percentages of MGS3, pyramid surveillance field of vision of MGS games, timers for alert and evasion.\n+ NPC injuries applied to different body parts affecting different mechanics. Same as in other MGS games.\n+ Interrogations actually help even if you know the vital mission objectives such as pointing out Rough Diamonds locations, nearby Specialists, optional prisoners.\n+ Smooth transitions from gameplay to cinematic. Same as in other MGS games.\n+ Unlike other games in the series, nothing is strictly missable aside from cutscenes as you can replay story missions and freeroam to obtain them (e.g., cassette tapes). This makes it possible to not require a guide to play through the game!\n+ Interactive camera during cutscenes. Always refreshing since the first game.\n+ You can play with Japanese audio tracks. With that said, MGS5 was developed specifically with the English cast's performance (including motion capturing), where the Japanese version is actually the dubbed one. This is in contrast to all previous releases where characters' vocal and facial expressions were developed with lip-syncing exclusively to Japanese and not English voice acting: MGS1-4, PO, and PW.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Call of Duty-esque health state including regeneration rather than the health bar of previous games.\n+ The infection is an interesting idea. But it's also inconvenient. If you quarantine and then rush the missions 26-29, you still lose up to 20 people.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Casette tapes over codec calls. The music tapes are great and something iconic for the radio transmission of the Metal Gear series. However, the mission details available via optional cassette tapes is passive over the interactivity of the codec calls. There's no incentive to sit and listen to them; a better design is to integrate them into the core game.\n+ Combat Deployment's Dispatch Mission system and upgrades for Mother Base. It's a waiting game and totally a mobile move. Boring..\n+ Rating the gameplay for a mission with ranks. This emphasizes certain playstyles: non-lethal, stealth (no alerts or hits taken), tactical takedowns, headshots, interrogations, rescues. This combined with Fultoning emphasizes the specific gamestyle of tranquilizer single-shot pistol for mid-range; tranquilizer sniper rifle for long range; CQC for close range; water pistol for destroying electronics; Fulton-ing enemies to get rid of bodies; letting them see you briefly, magazine, decoy, or buddy for distractions. Forget about weaving through enemies for the no trace (while this may improve mission time and give the perfect stealth bonus, it removes all takedown bonuses, Fultoning possibilities, and exploration of areas for items); Rambo-style with assaut rifles/SMGs and rocket launchers; deploying grenades that alert others; D-Walker assults; cardboard box; etc. The point of MGS5 is to explore and adapt the playstyle as the enemies also adapt; the rating system is at odds with this. More broadly, this is a platformer game element and is a reason I don't really like platformers. Previous games did have ranks, but it was over the entire game which made focusing on a particular style not as incentivized as there are no in-game awards for it, only glory of completionism.\n+ Fulton. It's too essential a game mechanic for something that feels so silly in its realism. I'm not sure if I would even put it in the same weird mechanic that defines Metal Gear as, e.g., the cardboard box.\n+ Credits before and after every mission.\n+ Save states for the Japanese and English versions are not compatible. This makes it difficult to use someone else's save state as most play in English.\n\n## References and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://metalgear.fandom.com\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/\n+ http://www.wsgf.org/dr/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/en\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain/Walkthrough\n+ CQC guide | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Fgdr58-ao\n+ non-obvious tips | https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/9kio9y/mgs5_nonobvious_tips_no_spoilers/\n\nI played with Japanese audio and English subtitles, which is the native game. My total playtime as recorded by Steam is 43 hours. I beat the base game (except for Mission 45-46) and did not go for completionism, e.g., all side ops, missions, maxing out R&D items. The game was just not very fun to continue. I skimmed through Missions 45-46 on Youtube to see the content.\n\nI found the following two series very good for getting caught up with the series. These cover up to MGS5 in less than an hour (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngySxUOj-VI, https://justpaste.it/j0cs). Kefka Productions has a 12 hour overview of the full serise (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K977NxGhyU). This one explains the game order (https://www.gamingscan.com/metal-gear-game-order/). If there's one thing clear, it's that the story is convoluted with crossings, double crossings, world conflicts, clones, etcetera. Each game is really a platform for Kojima to express certain interesting mechanics, and the lore is just made to try to best fit it (https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/3hxcg1/the_history_of_metal_gear_in_12_minutes/cubm82n/). It's clear lore is not Metal Gear Solid's strong point as an overarching story, but it still remains interesting within each standalone game.",

    "date_finished": "2/3/19",
    "comments": "Yakuza 0 excels in its urban realism, from Japanese culture absurdities to NPCs just living their lives to Yakuza badassery. It has a surprisingly good story: it's a simple tale but one rife with great main and supporting characters, and a sleu of interesting reveals that connect the two protagonists together (owner of the Empty Lot, Oda). The story and cast is complimented extraodinarily well by Yakuza 0's environment: roaming NPCs and sprawling buildings in Kabukicho of Tokyo and Dotonbori of Osaka, 1988. There are also a variety of sidequests which lend Yakuza 0's fictional city (and inhabitants) a layer of depth.\n\n__Story.__ The story is simple but stands out with its main and supporting cast. I also particularly enjoy how Yakuza 0 starts with a \"rank-and-file\" Yakuza and as it touches on higher tiers of the organization. I also liked how the various threads started to branch---showing the abilities of each of the 3 Dojima clan lieutenants, as well as weaving the story back to Majima's tale in Sotenbori.\n\nMajima's introduction is amazing. I was smiling the whole way through. First, a cliche but fun scene of a newbie entering a club with yakuza tendencies, an abrasive guy breaking cabaret rules. Then Majima with his utmost respect for customers (even to an eccentricity), then his fighting skill, then his ability to navigate a social situation by revealing his underlying plan: have the abrasive customer pay for the night from all customers. He is not below begging---dignity is just not a concern. That's what makes him awesome as a character that can only exist in Yakuza. Yakuza 0's ending makes it clear that Yakuza 0 serves not only to give a gentle introduction to Kiryuu, but an in-depth character growth of Majima, a previous fan favorite across the Yakuza series for his quirkiness.\n\n__Environment/\"Levels\".__ I like the level design focus being a closed-open-like world environment. Unlike other JRPGs, the advantage is maximum content usage out of a given zone, really pushing the depths of one's appreciation of it. I especially love that by the end of the game with playing many substories and overarching minigames, I have a good understanding of the street name locations and where bars/restaurants are located. The converse is to simply traverse certain zones such as low leveling areas only once. It's reminiscent of Dark Souls 1, where combat has a handful of options, but you're really tested to master and appreciate all of them as you're pitted against a variety of boss mechanics and environment situations forcing you to use them all (e.g., you cannot circle-strafe at Anor Londo but must learn to parry).\n\n__Gameplay.__  I like its interactive RPG elements going from point A to point B ranging in monotony (\"Find a payphone\"), absurdity (\"Sing a Karaoke song\"), action badassery, even the variety of cutscene interactions (hitting a button at the right time) and variety of gameplay missions. Yakuza 0 feels more like a visual novel with a variety of disconnected gameplay elements. The combat and various minigames together make Yakuza enjoyable but aren't individually very interesting.\n\nMinigames can be a hit or miss, where it's mostly the variety and underlying story that makes many substories worth playing (otherwise they're often glorified fetch quests). With that said, there are certain really good gameplay elements. In particular, Cabaret Club is not only a unique mix of quirkiness that would only exist in the Yakuza series and also a refreshing set of gameplay elements. You recruit girls off the street (some of which also intersect from the substories), level them up, provide special training, and interact when running the club---including having to learn the cabaret girl signals for bonus points. The Real Estate Royale and Dragon and Tiger's Equipment Search on the other hand are boring. Gameplay is stale (click a few buttons, wait 5 minutes for results). The only saving grace is the ability to expand your empire, along with minigames of each area as you battle the Four Billionaires, which also already exists in Cabaret Club. The nail in the coffin is that farming Mr. Shakedown and Real Estate Royale are the most profitable even if they're not very fun. Also notable are Karaoke (mediocre / serviceable), Dance Battles (fabulous idea), Telephone Club (fabulous idea although FPS is annoying), Catgirl Battles (funny idea but poorly executed with its RNG mechanics and unpredictable battles), Pocket Cars (quirky otaku fun).\n\n__Combat.__ The combat is good but not outstanding enough to play Yakuza just for it. With that said, I do like the variety of fighting mechanics, especially in its outlandish actions when you use the Heat Bar and pick up objects. I also like that the RPG skill tree does not just upgrade stats/numbers but enables new mechanics themselves. In terms of combat, I only wish the game were a little more explicit in having players fully realize the potential of all the fighting mechanics. For example, you can certainly grow into mastering each of Kiryu's fight styles, where Beast is good situationally against groups especially if there are objects around in the scene, and where you don't need to evade often; Brawler is great for 1 to 3 and generally versatile; Rush is great against slow enemies, typically 1-on-1, where you need the evasion tactics. For Majima, I liked Thug as a generally versatile style; Slugger works well for dodgy enemies like the Sera boss, but it's also generally versatile; Breaker only really has a role for stunlockking groups but its damage is very low. Mastering each of the fight moves per style however is complicated. There are certain mechanics that just aren't available in other styles, and so there's a lot to memorize.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ Dialogue. It's comprised of cutscenes interspliced with visual novel scenes (i.e., without moving mouses, mostly wallpapers) interspliced with static engine movement (i.e., same as in gameplay but you watch the scene move) interspliced with gameplay scenes where the dialogue happens as you move. I love it all. The variety keeps the viewer absorbed into the story.\n+ Universal currency for both experience and in-game usage.\n+ No(t much) content is missable. This is a huge problem I have with the Souls series' sidequests, and with JRPGs' genre standard of missable loot. With Yakuza 0, you don't really miss out on anything: you can always pick up on the substories at any point or move on to the main story. The only thing missable are trophies which I don't care about. The biggest one I do hate is that you can miss rewards if you select the wrong dialogue. This prevents you from picking your favorite dialogue reaction to elicit, for example, the most hilarious dialogues.\n+ You can pause cutscenes. You can even replay them from the main menu.\n+ You can replay boss battles. This is something I always wished for from the Souls games as bosses are a highlight of the series. I would love to just boot up the game and recall fond memories as I retry battle and boss mechanics, especially ones that I breezed through the first time if only for sheer luck or via a specific tactic.I get that this breaks lore however and is unfit culturally for Souls. That's no stopping Yakuza 0 however, which is more self-aware.\n+ You can throw a wad of cash in the air to distract people in your way..\n+ No penalties for dying, including having to run back from save point or anything; you just restart the mission.\n+ Swap narratives between two characters (both of which are likeable) every two chapters.\n+ The Yakuza back tattoos are all fantastic.\n+ Unintentionally, the meta for farming currency is farming Mr. Shakedown with a Shock Gun. The fight is actually still skilled and reminds me of Dark Souls 3 boss fights where you have to dodge battle mechanics and whittle down HP while avoiding getting 1 or 2-shotted.\n+ Marina is a goddess as a secretary. I like her rapport with Kiryu and other NPCs (e.g., the help wanted sidestories). Her face also came from a JAV actress.. Same rapport dynamics also go with Goro and Yuki.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ No autosave.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Weapons in this game have such low durability that it's not worth the inconvenience to ever regularly use them. They run out after ~50 hits, which is maybe 2-3 fights. At most, it's useful situationally during boss fights, but it's not worth that trouble in considering it.\n+ Majima's send-off fetch quest missions in Dragon and Tiger. Similarly, Kiryu's real estate missions. I hate these waiting mobile-game-type missions.\n+ While I like the novelty of dine-in eateries and the variety of food options, there's nothing in the gameplay mechanics to incentivize consuming this variety aside from completion points. The best option is always the Stamina bottles. I wish there were better incentives.\n+ While I like the RNG element of not knowing the girl (and possibly getting duds) in the Telephone Club, it's very difficult to achieve all 7 substories. Even if you narrowed down the selected girl by bikini color, RNG chooses one of 3 different girls (Sakura, the specific girl, an older trap version; all with subtle distinctions based on voice). It would be nice to remove already completed substories until you have all of them.\n\n## References and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.ign.com/wikis/yakuza-0/Walkthrough\n+ Mr. Shakedown farming guide (I did this in combination with Real Estate) | https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/816306-yakuza-0/74980815\n+ Cabaret Club Czar hostess signals | http://www.gamersheroes.com/game-guides/yakuza-0-sotenbori-cabaret-club-czar-guide/\n+ Cabaret Club Czar outcomes for each action | https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/241144-yakuza-0/faqs/74451/basics-of-a-cabaret-club\n+ Cabaret Club best makeover combinations for platinum hostesses | https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/6e5v6a/yakuza_0_cabaret_club_czar_girls/\n\nI played it on Windows. My total playtime (as measured by Steam on 2/3/19) is 61 hours. I beat the game in ~50 hours. I completed the base game, most but not all substories, Real Estate Royale, and Cabaret Club Czar. The only things I missed are 100% completion points and various trophy achievements such as New Game Plus/Legend difficulty.\n\nFollowing suggested play order for the Yakuza series, I played this one first (https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/8zeg4i/yakuza_game_order_and_remakes/). I played it blind, without a guide. This seems to be the best approach for this style of gameplay. I only consulted guides for confirming that I select the right dialogue options, typically during substories; I also consulted them when I get stuck in the main story. As for balancing main story and substory progression, I played the main story and completed substories as I encountered them on the way. I also completed substories if I got bored with the main story. After the main story, I went ahead to complete all substories.\n\nGTA is a description although not quite apt in terms of its urban environment and sprawling sidequests over the main quest---Yakuza is plainly Japanese in culture, and not a true open-world. It's closer to a RPG (note: not \"JRPG\" which is arguably its own genre more than a category) and beat-em-up hybrid.",

    "date_started": "1/13/19",
    "date_finished": "1/27/19",
    "comments": "You can really see how Demon's Souls started it all. For examples: levels, bosses, difficulty, atmosphere, checkpoints and respawning enemies, online system, weak/strong attack balanced with stamina and staggering/poise, nexus with NPCs, stats and STR vs DEX vs quality vs INT vs faith builds, souls as a universal currency, illusory walls. Even tiny details originate here: the iconic You Died message; the souls-gathering sound effect; Stray Demon design; ambushes; large enemies doing a butt stomp to avoid you always hugging them; Valley of Defilement (5-1) as the beginning to all mandatory poison zones in a Souls game, especially resembling Blighttown with its verticality and wooden plank pathing; the puzzle boss battles inspiring Dark Souls 3's; Red-Eye Knight as the precursor to Black Knights.\n\nCompared to other Souls games, Demon's Souls excels most in its atmosphere. Tower of Latria (3-1) is an excellent example, filling you with a sense of dread. The level design also feels authentic and not video-gamey.\n\nIn terms of weaknesses, I find compared to other Souls games that Demon's Souls lacks the interesting sidequests of Dark Souls 1, the larger variety in armor sets of all future Souls games, the feeling of world connectedness of Dark Souls 1, the more polished combat mechanics of Dark Souls 2, the boss fights of Dark Souls 3, and the music of Dark Souls 3. However, its fatal flaw is its reliance on healing consumables, where the finite capacity of Estus Flasks in future Souls games gives a constant state of pressure as you manage your heals for a given run; here, it's simply an exercise in farming. With 20+ full grass, any boss can be done on the first try. Its second major flaw is World Tendency and Character Tendency, which are vague mechanic barring content and which are difficult to achieve even with the knowledge of how they function (this is similar to how I hate the vague and strict requirements necessary to progress sidequests in future Souls games).\n\n__Lore.__ It's a separate descent towards madness than the Dark Souls series. And it's so much darker. Instead of each story being about the renewal of the cycle of fire and darkness, this is about understanding a medieval setting onset with Demon Souls. It's unfortunate there's less diegetic storytelling in this game. It just feels a lot more minimal with less interconnectedness of stories among all the bosses in a given area.\n\n__Combat.__ I'm surprised how this is even clunkier than Dark Souls 1. I think what makes it feel clunky is the lightweighted feeling of landing a hit. Every enemy recoils (or just doesn't) with the phantom-like effect rather than feeling like you're striking actual flesh. The recoil action is also fairly generic. Footstep sounds don't exist (at the very least when you're in Souls form which is pretty much when I always play); same for rolls; the idea of Hollowing/Undead in future Souls games is better than the corporeal state. The combat pacing is about the same.\n\nAside from maybe Tower Knight and Flamelurker, the bosses were not very challenging compared to the difficulty in other Souls games (especially Dark Souls 3).\n\nThe game relies on healing consumables instead of bonfires replenishing Estus flasks. This is fine by itself, but during the game you end up having so many heals that many enemies and zones aren't challenging unless they kill you before you're able to use a grass. This leads to a one-sided understanding of difficulty in contrast to other Souls games where you had to better monitor your Estus flask usage (https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/no1xd/wheres_my_estus_demon_souls_after_dark_souls_is/c3amsxv/).\n\nI like that the idea of bosses not just being difficult encounters but set pieces (possibly puzzles) all originated here. Some of the fights are great. None are particularly challenging however.\n\n__Setting/Level design/Graphics.__ The levels themselves feel like actual locations in the real world though. This presents a level of authenticness that the Souls series doesn't do in other games---feeling more video-gamey in their designs. I found Tower of Latria (3-1) in particular to be astounding in atmosphere. I felt a growing feeling of anxiety playing it all the way through---the dim lightning, the constant groans by prisoners, the bell sound by patrolling Mind Flayers, the prison cells filled with torture devices, the Iron Maiden openings.\n\nBecause of the teleporting between Worlds, Demon's Souls feels less interconnected than Dark Souls where the Nexus feels game-y similar to Dark Souls 2 and Dark Souls 3.\n\nManipulating and managing World Tendency is a pain. I don't think it's a good mechanic in any sense.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ There is no difference between vitality and vigor like in other Souls games.\n+ What I hoped the boss battle would be for Gwyn.. They did it for King Allant! Hurray! :-)\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ World tendency as the form of Humanity/Ember.\n+ Female vs male exclusive armor.\n+ You can't sell items, only store them.\n+ Item load includes carriage rather than just equipped, with a storage NPC. Fortunately it doesn't affect anything such as movement or roll speed; it only affects the maximum amount of items you can carry at once.\n+ When near a slightly large step, your character automatically performs a move to get up it. Unlike the rest of the Souls games, this lets your character traverse higher ground than what you would expect from just walking/running on slopes. It is effectively replaced by an explicit Jump move in future games.\n+ No gauge bar to tell how much poison capacity (and other status ailments) you're currently taking.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Like Dark Souls 1, Demon's Souls has notorious running paths back to an endgame boss. They're frustrating. Dark Souls 3 learned to do this better.\n+ Grinding. You have to grind. A lot. This includes healing consumables, upgrade materials, Souls, you name it.\n+ Unforgiving in the few-to-zero shortcuts in most maps. If you die you really do start over again.\n+ Rings (and armor in general) is just lacking in variety and awesomeness. They nailed the weapons the first time in Demon's Souls pretty well though.\n+ The opening animation is a bit verbose and feels cheap in sound effects. Dark Souls successors all did it better.\n+ No Homeward Bone. There's technically Shard of Archstone, but it's a rare drop and costs 5000 souls, which makes not a frequent usage.\n+ No jump or plunging attack!\n+ Unlike other Souls games, you can't reset aggro of an NPC, let alone still use their functions after they die (as you can in Dark Souls 2).\n+ Crystal Lizards don't immediately respawn. They also take forever to kill with much more health/defenses.\n+ Can't use multiple of the same Soul. I have to spam the item usage if I have, say, a dozen. At the very least, quickslotting it and spamming the use item is faster than having to go into your inventory every time.\n+ The subtext messages below You died, You acquired X soul, etc. I like the minimalism that they kept in future Souls games. Fewer words better emphasizes the messages.\n\n## References and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/demonssouls/comments/8ejkbx/guide_for_setting_up_demon_souls_on_a_ps3_emulator/\n+ http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/character-builds:166\n+ http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ (Surprisingly, wikidot for Demon's Souls is much more up-to-date, including a detailed zone walkthrough, than fextralife. Following my playthrough with the Dark Souls 3 cheat sheet, this one feels too detailed in telling me all the directions (it doesn't even tell me all items so it's not like it's even 100%). I just want something to make sure I don't miss a skippable item or make a mistake in dialogue/encounters. I converged to playing mostly blind but checking to make sure I don't miss anything crucial.)\n+ http://soulslore.wikidot.com/demons-souls\n+ This comparison with Dark Souls seems prescient: https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/1ybul4/demons_souls_compared_to_dark_souls/cfj5c9x/.\n\nI played via the RPCS3 emulator on PC, following the guide at https://www.reddit.com/r/demonssouls/comments/8ejkbx/guide_for_setting_up_demon_souls_on_a_ps3_emulator/; ISO here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Roms/comments/70l97g/demons_souls_download_for_rpcs3/. I ran at 1440p (rescaled from native resolution at 1280x720p) at 30 FPS. While this is not ideal from 60 FPS, it's still better the lower resolution and locked FPS in a PS3. See, e.g., the resolution comparisons in RPCS3 video demos. As of my playthrough, certain textures were missing (e.g., Soldier Shield is invisible). I also experienced flickering (https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/issues/4857) and sudden frame rate drops and slowdown when loading areas.\n\nI chose Soldier and went with a quality build. Like other Souls games, I go (great)sword and shield. I used the Broadsword for 1-1 and 1-2, then the Bastard Sword for 2-1, 3-1, 4-1, 5-1, 2-2, then the Meat Cleaver for the rest of the game due to its excellent S scaling on both STR and DEX. My progress route is: 1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 3-1, 4-1, 5-1, remaining of 2 (2-2, 2-3), remaining of 3 (3-2, 3-3), remaining of 4 (4-2, 4-3), remaining of 5 (5-2, 5-3), remaining of 1 (1-3, 1-4), end game. Following discussion online, it seems the numbered levels in each world are the same difficulty.\n\nIn the early game I ended up using almost all my grass to defeat Tower Knight. I'm not up for farming in this game (especially as it's on an emulator). Therefore I used the dupe trick to get infinite Crescent Moon Grass, Hero's Souls, and upgrade materials (including Demon Souls so I don't have to get just one trade-in option). These are small enough consumables to be convenience-savers rather than overpowered; for example, if I'd like to repair after a death where I have 0 souls.\n\nThings I missed:\n\n+ In general: World Tendency specific things. Things that require revisiting (e.g., Pure Greystone given by Scirvir if you show up with the Dragon Bone Smasher). Various item sets from vendors that require Boss Souls or many souls. Friend's Ring from Monumental (requires Pure White Character Tendency).\n+ 1-3: Ostrava. He didn't appear, which makes me assume he died somehow in 1-2.

    "comments": "Path of Exile is the best action RPG in the genre. It takes highlights from what makes the Diablo series so iconic, and pushes these details even further. What a fanatical, ultimate end-game game for the hardcore action RPG fan. It's a great design point in considering the WoW-casual that Diablo 3 shifted to from Diablo 2, and the more hardcore elements of RPG pushed even further than Diablo 2 in Path of Exile.\n\nTo be honest, for Act 3-10, the game felt fairly repetitive in content. It was really just more of the same. I didn't find anything all that different with the mobs, the levels, the lore. The bosses vary a little bit. I played until the endgame to experience all the content, and there's a lot!\n\n__Mechanics.__ I really like the idea of gems (active and supporting, and levelable) and a passive skill tree that's universal across all classes. It's a unique design point in contrast to the standard of ascendancy class-specific skill trees and stat allocation. Gems conflate the idea of skills with your gear as you have to find ones with appropriate sockets; I feel this ties things quite well. Gems are more powerful in variety than Diablo, with support and active gems. Same goes with flasks.\n\nMappings are clearly an improvement over Diablo 3's rift and greater rift system. Each tier has a unique map and not just scaling of the same zone; and each map is overloaded with attributes as an item, so you get a lot more variety. With that said, they're still not as good as Delves as they require backtracking and incur RNG on which maps drop. Delves are a linear route with a constant density of enemies. The only problem is that you have to farm Maps in tangent in order to have sulphite.\n\nI like the genre standards: tons of items being dropped; magic find; health and mana pools with 5-6 spells; sprawling minimap zones; shrines; identify and portal scrolls; league as active content and with a resetting economy; no bind-on-pickup/equip items. With that said, Path of Exile maintains certain things from the Diablo II era that seem unnecessarily painful, but I don't know that trades off against being too streamlined as WoW's state since Cataclysm did. For examples: must identify rares before vendoring in order to get more currency; identify scrolls (not even Deckard Cain for mass identify; I do like the more play-like feeling of shift-right clicking to quickly identify each item rather than moving the mouse from each item back to the identity scroll stack. It's a power user move though and should be made more intuitive); portal scrolls (although there is a nifty portal gem which you can use via your second weapon set slot); no auction house, relying on third-party services which makes trade non-instantaneous but does require more social interaction; services like selling a crafted bench, mirror service, labyrinth completion, or xp leech (all of these require player trust based on services that could be better maintained to avoid needing those trust issues in the first place); must single click each currency item to the currency tab instead of a dump single click.\n\nI love the game's new content ideas: Vaal side areas, abyss, breach, tormented spirits, syndicate, prophecies, mines, labyrinths, hideouts, bestiary, pantheon, incursions, mappings.\n\nOther interesting ideas: divination cards, no universal currency where all items are inherently useful (similar to Stone of Jordans in Diablo II as gold was useless beyond repairs).\n\nIn contrast to Path of Exile's mapping, I prefer Diabloâs bounty system which revisits past maps and with new content for endgame players. I do like the mapping system over rifts though as there's more variety in the content (e.g., shaping atlas, filling out atlas, different content appearing such as Shaper and Elder). The map system using the same tile palettes and monsters as a given map is interesting, but it encourages no revisiting of the 10 acts. Instead, these really are just treated as \"tutorials\". In 3.5, the endgame consists of map atlas, delving, the different master contents appearing in the map (e.g., incursion, betrayal syndicate, bestiary), and gear and level grinding (flasks, gems, gear, jewels, passive skills, crafting theory), the 4-occasional labyrinths. This gets repetitive once you start tasting them all by, e.g., T10+ maps.\n\nI like that this game doesn't hold your hand. It plays like a 90s game in difficulty, level of handholding, and complexity of mechanics (e.g., stats).\n\n__Lore.__ Mediocre. It feels closer to a porn story in that you expect one to exist, and it ties everything else in, and the demographic doesn't care if it's too in-depth.(It's a weird analogy; I didn't come up with it.) I would prefer a more interesting story however.\n\n__Aesthetics.__ I like the grunge medieval look. It really fits Diablo 2's persona, moreso than the cartoony WoW look of Diablo 3. I think the settings could have better fit the action RPG however. Contrast with the Souls series where a specific area has unique monster designs for that area (e.g., fortresses, monasteries, etc.) as well as unique monster placements that trap the player if they're not aware of their surroundings. Action RPGs are unfortunately a genre that converged onto the idea of facerolling all mobs. With the minimap overlay as the optimal strategy to encourage full exploration, you just don't pay attention to any single mob encounter or part of an area. That sucks.\n\nThe soundtrack is honestly forgetable. It works, but it doesn't stand out. I like the voice acting, but the dialogue like other action RPGs is a wall of slowly moving text. There's no way a player can be expected to listen to it all. I do like the mechanics of the carvings during the areas where they're played as you continue to traverse the zone; that's an excellent idea.\n\nThe gear aesthetics are honestly forgettable. Even the highest endgame gear like Inpulsa looks drab. It seems like all the good gear aesthetics are in the supporter packs that you pay real money for. (Contrast with, e.g., Guild Wars 2 which also has a cash shop for cosmetics but still retains a lot of nice aesthetics without it via each gear piece as well as dyes.)\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ I love the development manifesto (https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-forum/dev-manifesto). It's one of the most unique aspects of Path of Exile that I haven't seen in other games (in addition to the no universal currency, passive skill tree, and trading system). trade manifesto in particular is fascinating: https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2025870. From zero bind-to-character items to no auction house to linking items which verifies ownership. I like that they acknowledge the trading API with a public website is not ideal, and that trading would ideally be limited to the social level of forum-posting, not something that's basically close enough to being instant that it may as well be an auction house. Treated as a subpar auction house, it's clearly more inconvenient in having to mass-message people until you get the desired mass coumable; or if you have to wait until a player is online to see their index of items and hope it's available. Treated as a subpar social trading system, there's basically minimal speaking.\n+ No universal currency, dependent on items instead. I especially love its denominations as an improvement over Diablo 2's. Chaos Orbs are not just like Stone of Jordans, but you can also go higher with Exalted Orbs or lower with Orb of Alchemy. Minor how slow the trading system is and sometimes significant arbitrage, trading between currencies is itself pretty fluid.\n+ No multiple games with some lobby. All players are connected in one universe.\n+ Gems can be easily unsocketed.\n+ The universal passive skill tree is at first daunting but also much simpler in unifying stat allocation and skill trees across all classes.\n+ Crafting system. Rare items with strong attributes are actually best-in-slot more often than a legendary item. In Diablo 3, BiS ended up being sets due to powerful set bonuses which removed a lot of gear decisions.This is useful for a casual but against the PoE philosophy.\n+ Loot filter.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ No repair.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ With the conflation of gears, gems, and abilities, it's extremely important for a build to have the right gear combination with proper color sockets and links, and not bad gear attributes themselves. This makes individual gear choices incredibly tedious because you make to plan very ahead in understanding how certain gear fits with one another. This is just a no-go for leveling as it significantly slows down progress. Imagine for example, getting a good gear item, and with good sockets/links, but its colors are already satisfied by other gear items. Now you have to wait until you can replace that gear item before you can wear this one.. (With that said, this makes for excellent theorycrafting at the endgame. Gear has to fit holistically gem-wise; reach the max 75 resistances for fire, cold, and lightning; and get any remaining strength/dexterity boosts to equip all your gemmed gear.)\n+ While the game isn't really pay-to-win, stash tabs are a necessity gating much content, whether it be quality of life at the endgame for buying via currency tab or barring any selling until you get a premium stash tab.\n+ There's no good multiplayer experience such as doing endgame content together unless the Atlas strategy is exactly the same. Multiplayer only really appears in trading. There are no incentives set up for causal grouping or guilds.\n+ There is little system in-place for good trading. The community had to set up their own third-party software for this; it's a bit embarrassing that this is offloaded to users, and is nowhere near as good as an in-house solution can be with direct integration into the game. As poe.trade is essentially an auction house (and with many sellers as bots), it makes little sense to have players online in order to trade, and to not just implement an auction huose (or even something similar but more in-spirit to the game such as a [\"shop\" in your hideout](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/af75g9/the_bigger_poe_gets_the_worse_trading_will_get/edwhdrd/). This avoids potential scams and online reuqirements for trade; and also cool API ideas such as loot filters which filter items based on their currency trade value (c.f., Exilence app). This ensures you'll never drop a rare item or unique with perfect rolled stats.\n+ Lack of good PvP content to encourage a community around it.\n+ It's clear this game does not have the polish of a AAA title. There is constant server lag during peak hours and occassional disconnects. While I personally haven't experienced it enough to be detrimental to my experience, the disconnects from the game and lag are minor annoyances.\n+ No inspect feature.\n+ Can't right-click item to fast equip (instead of dragging over). I also prefer right-click over ctrl-click to quickly move an item to the second window such as trading, crafting, and the stash.\n+ Headhunter is a great item idea. But it's too broken even with its super high tier status to be so game-breaking it removes the [competitive atmosphere if you prefer that](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/99bhes/why_is_ggg_keeping_a_completely_broken_item_like/). It makes for a nice chase item (\"holy grail\") though, and maybe that's why the developers kept it.\n+ You can't bind flask usage to the same hotkey. I have to spam \"345\" whenever I DPS as those are my boosts, which is annoying.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.pathofexile.com/account/view-profile/nilmoe/characters\n+ https://www.twitch.tv/videos/362880842?filter=archives&sort=time | for posterity, Enki91's recorded gameplay is fairly accurate for how my gameplay experience looks.\n+ http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/\n+ https://www.poebuilds.cc/\n+ http://poe.trade/ | shop indexer for trading\n+ http://currency.poe.trade/ | shop indexer for trading (currency)\n+ http://poe.ninja/ | pricechecks\n+ https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2256698 | betrayal ladder\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/a9x3rv/some_tips_on_making_consistent_money/ecno0mf/ | I like this guide for doubling in both currency and so farming. Unlike others, itâs not singularly focused in that it pushes for the true endgame, it exploiting current league mechanics and economy such as low level devs.\n+ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOry8LIP7Vk&list=PLt5SL2R19SuLFX61HjO-6jJw-iy42tFOR | PoE Build of the Week\n\nI played until level 91 with a total playtime of 118 hours (as of 1/25/19, and according to Steam where much of it is idling in my hideout browsing Path of Exile guides and the trade API). I beat the game (Act 10) at level 68 with a Steam playtime of 24 hours. I did everything except for beat Shaper at the end, with a 159/159 map completion (~120 completed).\n\nI chose by looking at the most popular builds for each class in the current league (Betrayal/3.5). Then I saw the gameplay. I played a summoner in Diablo 3 and while fun, it was a little too hectic. I would like to do something with more explicit mob control. Action RPG in general seems to do best with ranged as you have minimap presence, and where you don't target just one mob but multiple.\n\nFor my first character, I chose the most popular and seemingly powerful meta here: Enki's Arc Witch (https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1147951). To maximize learning gameplay mechanics, I defaulted to its build and general item/quest strategies. It's a great no-brainer-type guide, helping from leveling all the way to the highest-end endgame with 10+ Exalted Orbs (it's just before billionaire status with rolling Headhunter and perfect RNG stats). I made only one modification: drop 4 5% maximum life passive skills for 18% increased attack speed. When selecting gear modifiers, I also preferred 3% attack and cast speed gains over any 1-2% DPS gains (e.g., I chose an Amulet with 5% increased Attack and Cast Speed enchant; this has a 3% total DPS decrease over Enki's personal character choice of Gain % of non-Chaos Damage as Chaos Damage). Mobility is just king in Path of Exile endgame as it speeds up map clearing, delves, any low-level farming, and is a huge quality of life improvement in general. Enki's Arc Witch build lacks most in single target fights (e.g., bosses). Arc isn't the best for single target DPS; the build requires staying in position to cast Arc or otherwise sacrifice DPS by just using Storm Brand and moving; and the build only has ~4.5k life (I had around that at levels 90-100 even with all the top gear). Getting additional mobility lets you be a little more skilled in casting Arc and dodging quickly. The second major flaw is survability. With ~4.5k life even in T15-16 maps, certain mods like monsters dealing extra damage can cause you to get one-shotted if you're not careful. This can be very frustrating given the death penalty on XP, which makes leveling from 90-100 a taxing experience. If I play a next character, I'd want to try melee and one with survavibility (e.g., molten strike).\n\nI used NeverSink semi-strict for my loot filter starting in Act 6. At level 70 and above, I used Neversink strict. After farming and getting ~5ex in total currency, I started to use the very strict filter in order to avoid any middle-trips during a map; I don't need to pick up rares to identify and vendor any longer as I make more money from explicit currency farming. I only sell items worth at least 1c for the effort.\n\nFor my Atlas strategy, I went to the highest tiers I can clear quickly, Transmute all white maps (T1-5), Alchemy all yellow maps (T6-10), and Alchemy and Vaal red maps (T11+) with no additional Zana monds and 4 chisels for T13+ (https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/a83vm7/new_players_guide_to_crafting_maps/). Dailies spawn on your last map's +/- 1 (for max of T14-16) so try to complete last map before daily reset at T15 (reset is (maybe) 6pm Pacific; https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/7002xx/sc_when_time_do_the_daily_deals_reset/dmzg0w6/); use Zana's Elder mod (15c) on all daily Atlas objective maps for maximum rewards if they aren't already T15 (https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/aewoi6/psa_always_run_your_daily_master_mission_maps/). Following numbers online, it only makes sense to chisel T14+ maps. Some mapping guides and meta suggest Atlas strategies so you farm a single map for the specific tier you're targeting (e.g., https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/6shakw/guide_mapping_for_newbies/). I went with the strategy of completing all maps. This lets me see all content as the canonical approach, achieve the completionist achievements, and following the introduction of Atlas objectives, it is required if you plan on completing the daily content such as [delves, incursions, Zana, and bestiaries](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/a1doji/whats_going_to_be_your_atlas_strategy_for_betrayal/eaoxhit/). (Note: When doing the T13-15 farming strategy, dropped maps always roll the tier first from 1 to X+2. If no such map exists in a given tier, it will downgrade to the next tier (this means you canât skip tiers to guarantee a higher drop rate for the highest tier. For a shaped map surrounded by low level tiers, it will eventually downgrade to them as neighboring maps are in the pool just like completed maps.)\n\nFor a day and a half, before I remembered about real money trading (\"RMT\"), I followed the meta on farming. For January 2019, this is low-level Syndicate farming. See 2019-01-path-of-exile-farming.md for details.\n\nI experienced everything in the game. I can tell when I really get into a game if I commit over 16 hours in a single day, follow the community (e.g., Reddit, global 820), use third-party tools (Path of Building as installed software, POE Trade Copy to Path of Bulding Chrome extension), play nonstop for consecutive days (stalling even real life work), learn about meta for currency farming (which is extremely boring), and even learn from the hacker community about given exploits and cash strategies (I used G2G and my two transactioni were each completed in <10 minutes; spent total of $45 for total of 59 Exalted Orbs).\n\nThe mainstream community (e.g., Reddit) is against hacking and real money trading. I acknowledge the spirit of this (especially for a legal community). However, I think these are important to accommodate faults in a game such as grinding requirements. I'd rather just spend the cash to avoid the grind; it's hugely more time-efficient (c.f., a max of ~400c/hr via Syndicate farming in Betrayal as of January 2019 is roughly 2.5ex which is only 4$). I spent a total of roughly 50 exalted orbs (as of 01/22/19) on my gear; I reached even Enki's personal character's DPS of ~1.1M Arc DPS on Shaper/Guardian while enemy is chilled and shocked, I shocked an enemy recently, and Storm Brand is attached to the enemy. Note I sacrificed 3% total DPS decrease for 5% attack and cast speed on amulet. Note I completely agree with this perspective however of not overdoing it (https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/abc2be/mathil_doesnt_want_your_handouts/ed0xxcc/): \" getting your own currency and building up your resources is a key part of the game. Take that away (e.g. by just accepting freebies from your fanbase as a streamer) and you're only playing half the game. It's like turning on 'god mode' in any other game - fun for 5 minutes but then you realise you just killed the game.\"\n\nWith ARPGs I always have a minor annoyance in trying to optimally route my map clearance. For example, should you zig zag to cover all spots or should you walk around in a spiral following the boundary? It's breadth-first search vs depth-first search, and with logistics such as walls in your way making one or the other strategy more efficient per generated map. My mind typically wanders as I clear a map to other topics or just this one about map navigation. This is because with ARPGs in general, combat is a little brainless in their simplicity (it's mostly about the crafting/building stage). With my Elementalist, I only have 3 active abilities: Arc for main damage; Storm Brand for DPSing large-health enemies; Decoy Totem for aggro-ing away large-health enemies. I have one movement skill. I have 3 buffs: 2 golems, 1 DPS gain.\n\nHere are various power user tips I picked up that I found useful:\n\n+ Path of Building. Useful for simulating DPS gains and capped resistances while using a Chrome extension to add poe.trade items.\n+ Hold shift right-click to to apply a stacked item multiple times instead of doing it just once. This is useful for mass-identifying items and crafting.\n+ Use a portal gem in your second weapon set. Use the keyboard shortcut to swap to the weapon, call the Portal skill, then swap back.\n\nContent todos:\n\n+ rename character | https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/81ggyl/character_naming_policy/\n+ when available | delve\n+ when available | last major solaris Pantheon power (Infernal King in T13 Caldera).\n+ atlas\n+ Install autohotkey for autopotion spamming; PoE trade macro (to know whether to vendor uniques); exilence for monitoring net worth per hour.\n\nGear todos (see guide):\n+ I only raelly use Storm Brand for tough enemies. Maybe swap Culling Strike with Blind then? Waiting on how I currently fare at T15/16 and bosses.\n+ 10 remaining skill points to 100: Celestial Judgment; 6 5% maximum life (alternatively, drop 4 for 2 3% attack speed and Berserker's 12% attack speed); 2 strength and a jewel socket.\n+ You're done!\n\nHoly grail gear todos:\n+ Best RNG numbers: 2 daggers, helmet, amulet, chest, 2 rings, glove, belt, boots. Corrupted Inpulsa's for chest with +1 to Level of Socketed Gems.\n+ Jewels: second mod on Watcher's Eye (20+ Exalted Orbs for ~5% total DPS increase). better RNG numbers on 2 abyss jewels.\n+ Flasks: best RNG numbers.\n+ Skill gems: Level 21 20% Storm brand. 23% quality or level 21 each in general.\n+ Venture further in playing new builds to eventually create your own!",

    "date_finished": "1/6/19",
    "comments": "Compared to other Souls games, Dark Souls 3 excels in its aesthetics, including visuals (set pieces to fill an area, boss designs, ideas for boss mechanics) and music. Music in this game ranks among the best Iâve heard in a video game period (ranks with many top JRPGs)---mostly the boss battles. Sound effects are also great. I also greatly prefer Dark Souls 3's bosses, which include not only atmosphere and set pieces (e.g., Deacons of the Deep) but interesting mechanical fights like Prince Lothric and Friede.\n\nMost players prefer Dark Souls 3's combat mechanics (namely, it's faster pace), but I actually prefer Dark Souls 1 (and to a lesser extent Dark Souls 2). Previous Souls games are more methodical and less spammy: with that said, Dark Souls 1/2 still had its flaws in that many enemies are shield-and-circle-strafe-able as opposed to dodging and R1-spamming. I also have mixed feelings about the new third focus bar, which replaces the finite number of casts in previous Souls games. Dark Souls 1's level designs are also better, with better bonfire placements and a feeling of world interconnectedness without [the heavy reliance on teleportation or elevators](https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/4jcxzx/critique_too_many_bonfires/d35tuxx). I also preferred Dark Souls 1's minimalistic story. It felt more diegetic than sandbox-y, without, e.g., a gamey mecca for leveling up, upgrading weapons, and talking to a bunch of NPCs to advance side quests.\n\nThe main flaws as with all Souls games are: tricky pathing of sidequests; mediocre covenant system; lack of real PvP (e.g., no lag, system with actual rewards and ladder).\n\n__Combat.__ Dark Souls 3 feels like Dark Souls 2 (the most methodical of the Souls games) on fast forward. It doesn't cater to my previous safe playstyle of hiding behind a shield until the right time to strike. Instead it encourages dodging via rolls. Unlike previous Souls games, Rolls are more resource-efficient as it costs less stamina and enemies attack more frequently to drain your stamina bar if you just block. Channeling Miyazaki from Bloodborne: \"Shields are nice, but not if they engender passivity.\" While it's faster paced, Dark Souls 3 seems more forgiving than other games. In particular, while enemies move faster, they do less damage. I'm always shocked when I'm not one-hit-KOed or 2-hit-chained to death in a boss fight due to a mistake I made. You can also move(!) while drinking Estus. And spam roll yourself in case you get trapped.\n\nBoss designs are a lot more unique and fit unique areas than the generic Fire Demon/Medusa/Knights of Dark Souls 2 and the development hell of three Stray Demons of Dark Souls 1. With that said, a lot of them are a bit gimmicky in finding a single weakness which is often not all that hard to find. For example, Lord Hodric is obviously not an interesting boss if the same mechanic had already been done (and much better for a challenging fight) for the tree boss. This is unlike Dark Souls bosses that require understanding a specific way to avoid specific moves (e.g., strafe left or right, dodge during X). But I enjoyed the many set pieces as I think bosses should not just be \"tough\" (e.g., Deacons of the Deep).\n\nFavorite bosses:\n\n+ Prince Lothric. The design is ingenious, with incestual-like brothers and a powerful prince Lorian who's shown as gone hollow as he's only on his knees. Teleportation is a great mechanic. Lothric as a ranged caster adds a great complement to the strategy.\n+ Pontiff Sulyvahn. The aggression describes Dark Souls 3 well. The phantom add is pretty easy to cheese though if you just spam R1 as he's summoning it.); Aldric (I love the ranged battle. It's my favorite running and attacking boss in Dark Souls.\n+ Gael. What an epic boss. Gael captures the essence of Dark Souls 3 well with the need for dodging, timing attacks, and maintaining endurance. Unlike the first half of Dark Souls 3, it's far more punishing in that you can get 3-shotted in the first stage and 2-shotted in the second and third stages. The music has an amazing crescendo as the boss gets increasingly more aggressive and with more variety.\n\nHardest (and sometimes unfun) bosses I've found: Prince Lothric (using a greatsword was probably not the best idea as I could only get 1 hit at a time while risking getting two shotted; I should also have learned to circle strafe rather than sticking in front of him); Nameless King (mastered first phase; had to hug him and heal while circle strafe and doging); Friede; Midir (hard-hitting endurance battle); Gael (hard-hitting endurance battle). Favorite monsters: pus of man; enchantress; hand giant; black knight; mimic; crystal lizard; winged knights; Ashes of Ariendal wolves.\n\n__Levels.__ These designs are what I imagine a modern Souls game would be like. The decorations make the levels so much more authentic than the barebones empty rooms of Dark Souls 1 and 2. Undead Settlement for example is haunting. The Undead flocking around a fire is well done. I also love the quantity of areas. This focuses on density of quality whereas the number of areas in Dark Souls II---many of which are quite similar---made for a forgettable experience.\n\nFavorite areas: Undead Settlement; Irithyll Dungeon.\n\nI didn't like Farron Keep. It's just a flat square with three pillars and poison inbetween islands. I greatly prefer Blighttown's design, and the lighting of No Man's Wharf. Ringed City is also a shithole in being unnecessarily difficult (see below).\n\n__Specific memories:__\n\n+ Dying to Gael over and over again. Learning the rhythm of the fight. And that long music crescendo over a chorus.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ You don't need to farm for Titanite. This makes experimenting with weapons and having an arsenal for quality builds actually viable.\n+ Ragdoll physics are realistic and not campy like Dark Souls 1.\n+ There are many throwbacks to both Dark Souls 1 and Demon's Souls. These are great in that they're not simply fanservice (examples which I think are done poorly is the weird fusion of Siegmeyer and Solaire as Siegward) but they're done to push further a mechanic done well. For example: the cages you enter in Demon's Souls and Dark Souls to move locations; Valley of Defilement (5-1) influencing Irithyll Dungeon; Patches the Hyena; Demon's Souls' Yurt and Mestiphoeles as the predecessor to Navaren; Stormruler-based boss battle.\n+ The speed to open a chest is actually realistic. You just lop the chest open.\n+ The infusion system is an improvement over Dark Souls 1's approach  by making it separate from refinement. Infusion gems also newly enable strength or dexterity scaling.\n+ I like the ember aesthetic. Ember provides an obvious (and pretty) aesthetic showing that you have the feature on.\n+ The reveal that Lapp is Patches all along. I did not see that one coming. The betrayal was fanservice done well.\n+ Fewer limited items: for certain boss fights in Dark Souls 1 you had to kill them a certain way (eg cut off tail, which doesn't appear in DS2+) or summon npcs and keep them alive (only one case in Dark Souls 3).\n+ Toolbelt. It serves a niche for out-of-combat items such as the White Sign Summonstone and Homeward Bone. I wish it could also be used to quickswap weapons instead of the alternative of cleaning your inventory to the bank.\n+ Jump is L3 while sprinting. I hate accidentally jumping with Dark Souls 1's controls, e.g., you cannot roll while sprinting.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Hyper armor as the approach to poise.\n+ Like Dark Souls 2, respec amount is limited per game playthrough.\n+ You can replenish Estus Flasks by killing enemies. This makes it slightly easier at the cost of the satisfaction of maintaining a fixed amount of HP recovery for a given run.\n+ Ashes vs just having more merchants. Ashes are more convenient but more gamey in that one merchant sells everything.\n+ Lock-on targeting is purposelly faulty in this game as you could lose the lock-on and have to retarget if they position behind you. This almost killed me multiple times during the fight with Pontiff for example. Similarly, you lose lock-on if the enemy falls.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Dark Souls 3's biggest flaw is a prevalent flaw in all Souls games but even more pervasive here: missable content. If you perform a sequence incorrectly you can permanently miss an entire questline---whether it be sequencing bosses before NPC encounters correctly, traversing zones correctly (e.g., Patches), or selecting the irreversibly wrong answer. This is very annoying, and it's even worse in Dark Souls 3 because questlines intersect (e.g., Siegward, Patches, and Greirat; Anri and Yoel/Yuria of Londor; Sirris and Ringfinger Leonhard).\n+ Like Dark Souls 2, you still have to go back to Firelink to level up. This combined with other conveniences (e.g., instant fast travel, linear world design) makes Dark Souls feel more video game-y than Dark Souls 1.\n+ Convenants lack in replayability and choices. For example, Darkmoon is the same as Blue Sentinel, and they only work with Way of Blue; you could collapse these three as one covenant. I'm particularly disappointed by the potential with the Moundmakers convenant. Because Moundmakers only are offered a reward by killing the host, there's no incentive for the alternative of actually helping the host. This would be especially during boss fights for chaotic backstabs.\n+ Because there are no incentives with the Way of Blue covenant aside from the possibility of help, there are far more people equipping Darkmoon or Blue Sentinel then there are people equipping Way of Blue. This could be solved by simply removing the Way of Blue covenant and making that mechanic always true.\n+ Items in the item shortcut (down arrow) automatically cycle. I must have died at least a dozen times due to the autocycle and myself thinking it was still an Estus Flask.\n+ Unlike Dark Souls 2's new enemy placement, and more like Dark Souls 1 and Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 3's new game plus only scales enemy stats. This makes new game plus not very interesting.\n+ Curse and Petrification are the same. Bleed with the maggots and poison are the same. The status effect variety is not as interesting as Dark Souls 1.\n+ I prefer necromancers instead of all skeletons reviving once. Necromancers are a more interesting mechanic.\n+ I don't know if I like Siegward. He is an artificial fan mash pairing of Siegmeyer and Solaire, two individually iconic NPCs.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Wikidot](http://darksouls3.wikidot.com), [Fextralife](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com)\n+ [Cheat sheet](https://zkjellberg.github.io/dark-souls-3-cheat-sheet). I enjoy cheat sheets over walkthroughs as the latter are too detailed via line-by-line instructions, ruining the game's mystery and pace. However, this cheat sheet is also still too detailed. Better would be a list of items in an area and missable events to watch out for. To combat this, I try to look at the cheat sheet only a few times in an area.\n+ [Quality build tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/DkS3Builds/comments/7l60ty/looking_for_the_best_quality_build_to_carry_a). SL1 -> 27 Vigor for soft cap -> 26 Endurance for soft cap -> 38 Dex.\n+ [Parry Guide by Juutas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pscvwXYPcG0)\n+ [Cheat Engine Table](https://github.com/inunorii/Dark-Souls-III-CT-TGA). The Grand Archives discord has the most up-to-date knowledge of what Cheat Engine scripts are bannable. Like Dark Souls 1, I find Cheat Engine most useful for infinite upgrade mats and respec so you can experiment more easily. I also save scum by backing up saves in order to speed up any long runs back to the boss.\n\nI played the Deluxe version (bundle of base game and two DLCs) and on max settings.\n\nMy first playthrough (as of 1/6/19 upon beating the game) was 59 hours. I played pure physical (ignore attunement, intelligence, and faith) as a quality STR/DEX build.\n\n+ __Starting class.__ Knight.\n+ __Gift.__ Life Ring.\n+ __Weapons.__ I started with the Long Sword until (and including) Catacombs of Carthus, then the Iriythll Straight Sword until (and including) Smouldering Valley, then the Lothric Knight Sword (immediately upgraded to +6) until (and including) Itrithyll of the Boreal Valley, then the Black Knight Sword (a great sword) until end of the game; then the Lothric Knight Greatsword from them on (e.g., DLCs). I like the aesthetics and speed of the straight sword, but the R1 spam does not introduce any variety, feeling like a hack and slash. It's mindless in that you rarely need to use R2, Kick, Jump Attack, Parry, or swap to two-handed and weapon skills; coupled with Pontiff's Right Eye, the game encourages stunlock R1 spam until you run out of stamina. In contrary, long reach weapons such as greatswords, spears, and halberds have a vertical vs horizontal vs forward thrust motion, each of which make sense depending on the scenario (e.g., are you walled in?) and enemy tactics (e.g., how are they positioned?).\n+ __Armor.__ I play Fashion Souls (as long as it's <70%) as it makes the game more challenging.\n+ I got the Usurpation of Fire ending only because it's the most convoluted so I can take it easier on any future playthroughs; I chose Anri's questline B as that's the only way to get her sword(?); I chose to make Irina of Carim a fire keeper as that offers more utility.\n\nMy zone progression followed the Dark Souls III Cheat Sheet. Notes:\n\n+ Archdragon Peak (did at level 80, which is severely underleveled as recommended is 95-120; fortunately done with coop with Danny; we stopped at the boss, which I eventually solo'd melee with a greatsword for the dragon and Lothric Knight Sword for the second stage.. it took me 3 hours at level 101. The first stage is super easy as long as you stay in front. The second stage requires luck in dodge rolling all his attacks and hugging via circle-stafe. The main challenges are: 1. maintaining stamina; 2. getting in hits (safer to do 2 for 500 per chance with my straightsword than 350ish for 1 attack of my greatsword); 3. avoiding getting two-shotted)\n+ Kiln of the First (beat game at exactly level 100)\n+ Ashes of Ariandel DLC (Wow what a tough area. I had difficulty with this area out of all DS3 areas. There were four sets of enemies that require good crowd control: Farron Follower, Wolf, Corvian Settler, Giant Fly; and multiple enemies that can two-to-three shot me: Millwood Knight, Corvian Knight, both Wolf and Villhelm minibosses. As an area I found it bland with mostly open snow and jumping down roots. There is more variety in the equivalent Frozen Eleum Loyce of Dark Souls 2.)\n+ The Ringed City DLC (This area is a piece of shit in difficulty. Angels and Judicators that you can't kill and must find the summoner much later in the area (what kind of level design is that?). I'm okay with the ganks in the Ringed City area. Those to me are great examples of level design in the Souls series as players can always pick them up if they're cautious of their surroundings.); pairs of Lothric Knights with a buff that can get 3/4 of your health; Harald knights and enemies that always 2 shot you.\n\nIn my second playthrough, I played a pure DEX build.\n\nTODOs\n\n+ Replay as caster build with faith/int or pyromancer.\n+ Replay as Paladin build (str/faith).",

    "date_finished": "12/30/18",
    "comments": "I think Dark Souls II excels most in its combat mechanics. I actually prefer its slowest, more methodical approach than the other games which are faster. While I didn't like the quantity of levels, I did find certain ones to especially fun: the open world feeling of Majula; Iron Keep; the general level design of Shulva Sanctum City; the verticality of Brume Tower. Apparently it also has the best PvP, but I didn't get into it.\n\nIn terms of major weaknesses, Dark Souls II just doesn't have as great lore---feeling like a video game fanfiction---and while it has the most areas and bosses, they tend to be very forgettable. It also suffers from the general weaknesses of Souls games: tricky pathing for sidequests, mediocre covenant system, lack of systematic PvP.\n\n__Lore.__ It's unfortunate Dark Souls II does not build much story-wise from Dark Souls. Unlike Dark Souls, DS2 lacks an overarching theme (e.g., madness) with an excellent supporting cast of sidequests and their devolving madness to the very same theme. This is one of Dark Souls 1's greatest strengths: a minimalistic, diegetic story rife with interpretation. There's no such analog in Dark Souls 2's various characters you see as you journey through it (https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/25na3j/i_feel_like_dark_souls_2_is_completely_lacking_in/, https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/25na3j/i_feel_like_dark_souls_2_is_completely_lacking_in/chizjf6/). Lucatiel of Mirrah is closest. DS2 feels closer to a Legend of Zelda game in that you're exploring dungeons without a particular motive in mind---the story is more sandboxy than minimalistic. \"In the first souls the context in which you met various characters told you something about their personalities. Solaire staring off into the amazing view of the sun, Quelena looking sadly at her sisters chambers, fat old Siegmeyer standing by some sort of barrier. In Dark Souls 2, NPCs are often met at random, in places that have little to do with their back story, personality, etc.\"\n\n__Setting/Level Design/Graphics.__ They're as great as you would expect. But the primary is a generic royalty setting which isn't pulled off well. In fact, even primary places like Drangleic Castle are mostly filled with empty boring rooms---nothing like the overhead cathedrals of Anor Londo or the prisons and libraries of Duke's Archives.\n\n__Combat.__ There are some great monsters such as Bel Keeper, Ogre, Giants; and boss fights such as Pursuer, Lost Sinner, Royal Rat Authority, Looking Glass Knight. But the majority of them are uninspired, obviously taking from fan tropes or original game: Scorpioness Najka, Smelter Demon, Duke's Dear Freja.\n\n__DLCs.__ I agree with the consensus. Their level designs are all excellent. Sunken King reminds me of the Abyss' Oolacile with its great variety and lighting. The Brune Tower is a bold and successful attempt at a main area achieved via verticality more than horizontal map movement. Frigid Outskirts is just as infuriating as Shrine of Amana. It's an admirable idea but it's so annoying to run to the boss.. It's not so much a challenge area as much as it's a question of constant repetition.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ You can join any covenant without breaking sins for joining another. This makes it easier to experiment with all of them rather than do intensive research studying to find the right one.\n+ Backstabs no longer have invincibility frames---only rolls.\n+ Respecs are now available. However, they're a limited consumable, which is unfortunate.\n+ You can kill NPCs and revive them, so you're not permnanently out of their features in the same way in DS1 you can absolve sins if you accidentally attack an NPC or offend a covenant.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ Parries are harder than in Dark Souls 1 and 2 due to parries having startup frames and attack animations being faster overall. Due to the startup frames, you have to anticipate when an enemy's attack will hit and that requires knowing not only each new enemy's moveset but predicting which move it will be from the early windup frames.\n+ Backstabs are harder in face-to-face combat and are 'nerfed' in general over Dark Souls 1. I can understand the realism. But this also greatly changes the combat playstyle as a very viable playstyle I did in Dark Souls was to constantly strafe-rotate around an enemy while holding my shield up until I could backstab. This was a very safe option assuming the shield could take infinite-damage and you had enough stamina. (For example, parry's on the other hand are risky as you can risk and there risk getting hit.)\n+ Fewer Estus Flasks in beginning and more healing Lifgems/consumables. With that said, as you accumulate Estus Flask Shards, it's extremely easy to be liberal with your 7+ Estus Flasks by midgame. This is unlike Dark Souls 1 where you only ever had 5 except in rare scenarios when you would invest the Humanity at specific bonfire locations.\n+ Teleportation is available from the get-go, and to any bonfire. I can see tradeoffs for and against having instant teleportation. I personally prefer Dark Souls 1's idea, which is to enable it only after mid-game, and to only select bonfires. This forces you to still travel in the world to get to certain areas.\n+ All items are repaired at a bonfire. This makes it much less of a concern to consider your equipment status as it's almost guaranteed you'll repair by the next time you hit a bonfire.\n+ Not hitting wall with weapon for illusory walls. By just hitting A, you can spam this on any wall. With weapon attacks, you take more time and also risk durability. Finding these are impossible without a guide anyway. I would prefer them to be slightly more visible and to require something like hitting so it wastes your durability.\n+ You can use Humanity without being at a bonfire. This makes it always possible to traverse to the end of the boss area and then always use the NPC summon. You don't have to risk Humanity as you get there. This is more convenient, but there was also something to the risk of using Humanity through a route as in Dark Souls 1.\nAged feather as a convenience tool to avoid constantly buying Homeward Bone.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Torches. I like the idea of controllable lighting, and the general tradeoff with holding a shield. However, the playstyle mechanic itself as a time-duration consumable is lacking. In particular, other than drops from enemies (all of which are also finite) there's a finite amount of torches in game. This makes you seriously consider using them, which for a collectionist like me is rarely. I also like following a walkthrough to be completionist. The Torch timer makes one avoid pausing. Quoting https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/160467/is-there-any-benefit-to-lighting-the-torches-in-the-game: \"In early trailers of the game, some areas were completely dark and it was necessary to hold a torch in one hand and your weapon in the other in order to battle enemies in that area. In the end it seems that From Software backed off from that game mechanic but left the torch and sconces in, but as far as I can tell no such areas remain.\"\n\n  That's very unfortunate. I could see controllable lighting being a very powerful idea in the mausoleums for example of DS1. There are instances of it being interesting such as to help against darkstalkers.\n+ Being invaded while hollow. I prefer playing Dark Souls mostly as a single player experience. There's not even an option to log off while playing unless you manually turn off your internet. But if you log off, you can't get Steam achievements.\n+ You're matched up in invasions with people based on your accumulated souls, not your soul level. This means if you die a lot but don't always pick up your souls, you're matched with people who could have used all their souls for their soul level and equipment.\n+ Draining maximum healthbar upon death. This discourages exploration and discourages using effigies/human status unless you're confident you can effectively use the full health. For me, this locked one of my ring slots to be Ring of Binding.\n+ Passages are gated by limited-quantiy and expensive-souls consumables: Pharros' Lockstone and Fragrant Branch of Yore.\n+ Agility stat. Unnecessary idea, too many stats.\n+ Enemies after roughly 11 disappear permanently. This is supposedly to discourage farming. I think even to ease players who keep on dying, I'd prefer to always have the enemies. This makes the game about skill, not endurance---you're always pitted to the same challenge and it's your skill that's being tested without a finite NPC limit.\n+ You have to go revisit Majula in order to level up.\nSkeptic's and Simpleton's Spices are too good. They encourage farming so that you only need 10 INT/FAITH to cast everything.\n\n## References and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Wikidot](http://darksouls2.wikidot.com), [Fextralife](https://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com)\n+ [Cheat Sheet](https://smcnabb.github.io/dark-souls-2-cheat-sheet)\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/5ozqxf/best_order_to_level_up_a_4040_quality_build\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/2dhr9a/best_class_for_quality_build\n+ Backstab tips: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IZytuxAVdI\n+ Strength weapons: https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/3ount2/best_weapon_for_pve_strength_build/cw0ngi1/\nWeapon scaling statistics: https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/20qjf2/guide_weapon_scaling/\n\nI played the Scholars of the First Sin version on the PC. This version is a strict upgrade on the original. I killed Creighton (because I get his mask which I'm not sure would be given otherwise). As of this writing (12/30/2018), my playtime is 68 hours.\n\nI started with a quality build to get the best of playing all weapon styles but eventually transitioned into a 40/15/20 STR/DEX/FAITH. I generally like playing with sword-and-shield followed by a bow for ranged attacks/aggroing from afar. I would love to use spells if only for buffs but that would spread me too thin for a third damage stat (there are already three additional stats to maximize for function; maybe if I do it minimally, or only raise one of STR/DEX to reach a certain requirement). From discusisons, it seems like a quality build with third stats allocated to either intelligence or faith also works. Faith seems generally agreed upon to be better for melee builds (https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/2efo4r/faith_or_int_melee_build/cjz0vtf/). If I did want to try out DEX, Faith, or INT, I could respec---fortunately there's not so few respec consumables that it's impractical to use. I don't care much for PvP.\n\nFollowing above, I started as Bandit which has the lowest in attunement and intelligence. For starting weapons, I used a mace as it scales well for both STR and DEX (https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/86w1vw/good_early_game_weapons/). I then picked up the Craftman's Hammer which seemed like a natural next upgrade in Lost Bastille. This and a Tower Shield is just amazing offense+defense. Since Drangleic's Castle, I picked up the Great Club and immediately upgraded it to +10. I combine that with a Tower Shield and pieces of Havel's Set to hit and take damage like a tank. I never intended to focus on strike weapons, but they stun enemies well which synergizes with the generally slow attack speed. I think this works overall with Dark Souls 2 which is slower and more methodical in its combat than other Dark Souls games. At end-game, I eventually switched to the Greatsword +10 (it has better durability and looks than the Great Club; I also prefer its horizontal swing as a weak attack with vertical as the strong attack) and a Gyrm Greatshield for best physical defense.\n\nOther playstyles I should consider (e.g., to try out): offensive mage, ranged bow-and-arrow, tanky paladin with faith and shields, keep oneself out of reach with long-reach weapon, two-handed dexterity katana.\n\nMy progress route closely followed Dark Souls 2's fextralife walkthrough:\n\n1. Things Betwixt\n2. Majula\n3. Forest of Fallen Giants\n3. Heide's Tower of Flame\n4. Cathedral of Blue\n5. No-Man's Wharf\n6. The Lost Bastille\n7. Belfry Luna\n8. Sinner's Rise\n9. Huntsman's Copse\n10. Undead Purgatory\n11. Harvest Valley\n12. Earthen Peak\n13. Iron Keep\n14. Belfry Sol\n15. The Grave of Saints\n16. The Pit\n17. The Gutter\n18. Black Gulch\n19. Shaded Woods (level 120 so overleveled)\n20. Doors of Pharros\n21. Brightstone Cove Tseldora\n22. Lord's Private Chamber\n23. Shrine of Winter\n24. Drangleic Castle\n25. King's Passage\n26. Shrine of Amana (even at SL 130 after 41 playtime hours this place kicked my ass as a primarily melee build. But it was a good ass-kicking like Sen's Fortress where I learned the ambushes and ranged mechanics. I particularly love the feeling of managing my stamina well to sprint to an Amana Priestess to DPS her down. What I don't like is the tricky and stupid pathing; if there are multiple homing missles at you simultaneously; and fighting in water. At times my hand was just forced to take the safer but very slow route of sniping individual targets (the last part next to fog wall is not only risky but with a significantly larger density of melee, ranged, and a healer). This single strategy-focusing is an example of bad level design.)\n27. Undead Crypt\n28. Aldia's Keep\n29. Dragon Aerie\n21. Dragon Shrine\n22. Memories of the Ancients\n23. Throne of Want\n24. Dark Chasm of Old\n25. Crown of the Sunken King\n26. Crown of the Old Iron King\n27. Crown of the Ivory King\n\nThings to do (ignores unnecessary things like unlocking Pharros Lockstones that don't do anything):\n\n+ Missed: Lucatiel of Mirrah's item set. Talking to Mifanitos for their rewards. I released Navlaan, so I don't get the Unleash Magic sorcery and Forbidden Sun pyromancy only obtainable by completing his assassination quest line. Kill Darklurker (tedious to have to run through dungeon again) Carhillion (requires >=8 INT to talk to him). Convenant maxing. Illusory Ring of the Exalted. Illusory Ring of a Conqueror.\n+ Huntman's Corpse: Minimum INT and FAITH to talk to Felkin and get the Sunset Staff/Hex Set.\n+ Earthen Peak: Pharro's Lockstone which has a small poison healing pool.\n+ Iron Keep: Lava chests: Humanity, Bonfire Ascetic, Phoenix Parma Shield, Fire Seed, Chaos Storm.\n+ Grave of the Saints: Pharris' Lockstone to get a bridge shortcut and poison traps.\n+ The Gutter: Light all Sconces in order to get invaded by Gutter Denizen who drops the Black Witch Veil Set.\n+ Shaded Woods: Petrified Lion hiding connection to bridge (useless). Petrified Lion carrying Warlock Mask.\n+ Brithstone Cove Tseldora: Ring of Resistance from Cromwell the Pardorner if FAITH>=35.\n\nBalancing completionist walkthroughs and experiencing the game in its mystery and glory without handholding is difficult. I like walkthroughs because it ensures you learn about every mechanic and missable feature (e.g., items)---especially finite ones that you can't go back to get before. I like experiencing the game without walkthroughs because it's how the game was intended: your enjoyment of the game is otherwise significantly dependent on the quality of the walkthrough, and can be spoiled (e.g., ambushes behind corner, Mimics, the mystery of a level before understanding its full design). When a game is first released, there is no walkthrough. From Things Betwixt to Iron Keep, I closely followed the walkthrough as I went through routes. Since Iron Keep, my policy is to now play through each dungeon blind, consulting a guide if I get stuck (e.g., am in dire need of a bonfire) or am about to interact with an NPC. After a dungeon is completed, I go back and sweep through it to collect all missing items. I of course still liberally use a walkthrough for guides on builds, items, and other one-off things. I think this is a good tradeoff as spoilers only occur dungeon-by-dungeon.\n\nMy favorite areas: No Man's Wharf, Shulva's Sanctum City, Frozen Elyeum Loyce. Worst areas: Shrine of Amana, Frigid Outskirts, Iron Passage. My favorite bosses: Pursuer, Looking Glass Knight, like the design of Lost Sinner (battle was okay).",

    "comments": "Dark Souls stands out most in its minimalist story driven by visuals, glorious orchestral and choral soundtrack, and environment; and combined with excellent, unforgiving combat mechanics. Playing this game from bonfire to bonfire is like playing a speedrun. You have to complete every encounter just right. Any mistake and you start over. I like this level of difficulty because it puts the fault on the user---deaths are (usually) a player's fault, and you learn from deaths and improve in the game through knowledge rather than artificial means like stat scaling. This knowledge comprises map and enemy spawn points; enemy movesets; and experimenting with ways of handling enemies and various encounters.\n\n__Gameplay.__ I've never seen a game be so realistic with its health, and focus on equipment load and individual weapon styles each with its own set of moves, weight, reach, and damage rating. Weak attacks, strong attacks, blocks, kicks, parries and riposte, rolls, and jumps---all of which use endurance. For example, you have to be precise with positioning. You often fight in narrow corridors where long weapons and swinging attacks are blocked by the walls. You need to either position yourself so your swing will not hit terrain or you must use a thrusting weapon.\n\nDark Souls' combat pacing is slow. It's better suited to the sword-and-shield mechanic of timing blocks while recovering endurance and attacking (compare, e.g., to the Dark Souls 3's R1 spam and dodge meta).\n\nExploration is perfected in this game. Unlike open-world RPGs, Dark Souls encourages players to explore every crevice in an area, with the feeling that the area is hand-designed and with missable loot. This is as opposed to the AAA philosophy of designing a generic area filled with a fixed set of assets (side quests, collectibles, enemies).\n\n[Level design is masterful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ9_RJ2EPo0). Difficulty in the game is not just the enemy AI/moveset but also the challenging levels that you fight them under. For example, my favorite zones are Undead Burg, Sen's Fortress, and upper Blighttown. They have a fun mix of enemies, interesting battle scenarios, great setting environments, and amazing lighting. My least favorite may be Lost Izalith, Crystal Cave, and Great Hollow. These are monotonous in enemies, lack interesting variety in settings (even though there's so much potential with the theme, and aesthetically they're still beautiful as with all of Dark Souls' areas).\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The game's lighting is one of its great environmental cues. It's used for atmosphere, camoflauging enemies, highlighting precarious terrain. I love the bestiarity and variety of zones, including enemies that were previously bosses now arising as minions in higher-level zones. The only enemy I didn't like was the Crystal variety which simply reminded me of palette swaps from classic JRPGs. It's a cheap way to make new enemies. Same especially goes for Asylum Demon, Stray Demon, and Demon Firesage who are all supposed to be unique bosses. Game would feel higher quality just omitting the latter two altogether. Lost Izalith is a clear indicator of the most rushed state of Dark Souls development with only 3 monster types in the whole area, and boring terrain.\n\nThe setting variety is \"video gamey\" similar to Ocarina of Time. They're artificially constructed in environment pathing and strangely diverse including ruins, fortresses, demon ruins, and catacombs. Demon's Souls does better at a chilling atmosphere by making the settings feel like they're real places.\n\n__Replayability.__ Dark Souls is easily one of the most replayable single player games, with a slew of options.\n\n1. New build. So many viable playstyles, each with different gameplay experiences. At the high level, this is STR vs DEX vs INT/FAITH and hybrids (e.g., STR/DEX quality, Paladin STR/FAITH, Pyromancer). There are also choices with two-hand vs sword-and-shield vs parry builds and light (emphasizing movement speed fast rolls) vs medium vs heavy armor (emphasizing armor and poise).\n2. New game plus (and its scaling) continues indefinitely until New Game Plus 7. I like it just as I like WoW's Mythic Dungeons and Diablo III's Rifts. It keeps the difficulties as high as possible until a point where things start to plateau and it really just becomes a numbers game (you need X level for X stats to compensate for the newly scaled Y-stat enemies). I only wish at the end of a game, you had the option to stay at the current level, or even chose among a selection of levels (e.g., all up to the ones you have been playing, or +1.) This lets you constantly challenge, e.g., speedruns at a given level for competitive play.\n3. Multiplayer with duels, invasions, and coop. The game does not systematically support online play very well. You have to play as a twink, i.e., cap your level just to find the right playerbase. There is no real matchmaking. There is no ladder, and no support beyond 1v1s. The addition in DLC is still not feature-filled.\n\n__Controller.__ This game is clearly designed with a controller in mind. The attack vs defend buttons, with strong/weak and defend/parry are naturally bimodal and segmented on a controller. The weapon toggling with the D-pad is way more intuitive than (shift+)forward/reverse scroll options on a mouse. I played all of the game with keyboard and mouse until the endgame when I was gifted a controller by Danny. The only major differences in Remastered is that with a controller, you can parry without having your shield up. This is crucial for saving a few frames to not have to time \"put up shield -> parry\" as well as for enemies that will kick you if you just have your shield up in preparation for parrying. The one benefit of keyboard and mouse is that you can pan around the screen while sprinting. (Sprinting and movement is spacebar + WASD which you can do on your left hand; panning is with your mouse on the right hand.) This is only useful in battle when you sprint and want to pan around to a corner to see if there's an ambush. Similarly, with a controller, you cannot continue sprinting and auto-target; this is useful for sprinting to an enemy with ranged attacks\n\n__Noteworthy memories:__\n\n+ Feeling claustrophobic in the Catacombs while I wander aimlessly into the tombs. As I kill Skeletons, they immediately respawn and they increase in number as I search frantically room by room for the Mage.\n+ Constantly dying to the Skeleton dogs, and especially the 3 dogs in a row with the fourth and one Skeleton King near the bonfire on the way to Nito.\n+ Playing through all of Sen's Fortress with Drake Sword and no ranged.\n+ Going death after death against Artorias. I eventually learned his entire moveset and could predict whether he would do a forward lunging, horizontal, and timing my rolls to get off hits. Boy that was a tough and fun fight.\n+ Siegmeyer saying \"Hmmmmm\".\n+ Crestfallen warrior's quotes.\n+ The upbeatedness and hollowed insanity that you experience with the variety of NPCs: Crestfallen warrior, Solaire, Siegmeyer, Reah, Big Hat Logan.\n+ The backstabbing and NPC invasions with Captain Kirk, Lautrec, Marvellous Chester, Patches the Hyena.\n+ The run back to Bed of Chaos. Fuck that. Crystal Cave also gets pretty close.\n+ Great Hollow. Second worst area in the game due to tedious platforming and slow pacing, second only to Izalith.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ No pause.\n+ No difficulties. All players know exactly how it feels to defeat a boss or an area.\n+ Bonfires as save states.\n+ Universal economy of souls for both currency and leveling up.\n+ Warp ability only after roughly midgame status; and to select zones so you still have to traverse the world to reach the thicket of zones.\n+ No map or GPS, so you really have to remember your orientation with respect to, e.g., the bonfire so you can pick up your corpse's souls if you die. I like this because it's both realistic to dungeon exploration and is one less feature to have to monitor.\n+ Heals are not instant-cast.\n+ Lack of a billion things to pick up from corpses only to sell to a vendor for gold. This is just unnecessary in an RPG. I also liked the idea of Souls as currency, which seems more plausible to get from an enemy kill than Gold as in most RPGs.\n+ Minimalist tutorial.\n+ Single game state. No save options aside from lighting Bonfire. No load options except the one. There are a bunch of character slots (however many times you start a new game) but they are all tied to the same game state.\n+ Armor arrives at a set, often in chests that hand you the full set. This makes it very easy to choose armor by simply uniformly selecting a set that fits your equip load. I love this simplicity and aesthetic.\n+ The combo of parry -> two-hand -> take step in -> riposte. Executing that feels so good.\n+ Crystal Lizards respawn at bonfires or reloading the game. Fortunately one of these is always possible in all Soulsborne games.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Online play with limited coop, invasions, bloodstains and messages. I like the spirit of the idea. But it also seems like Dark Souls is better off experienced as a true single player game. It's not a very good game for playing, e.g., coop throughout with a friend or through various short-burst games. However, it is an interesting way to tie players around the world together in a primarily single-player game.\n+ Lack of inventory weight, where movement and roll speed is based instead on equip load. I can see pros and cons for this, e.g., pros for inventory weight being realism and preparation during an adventure. Cons being needless management and an unnecessary level of complexity.\n+ The hilarity of ragdoll physics, i.e., corpses just flail around after the enemy is dead.\n+ Somehow I was fully expecting the final boss fight to be completely decrepit. That it would be an old man who thinks he's all powerful but is too slow and dies in a few hits. Funnily enough, that's the approach they took in Demon Souls.\n+ I wish this game allowed you to sneak in on certain enemies that weren't facing you. Seems very natural to the dungeon crawler and lets one play the stealth fantasy out. (It actually turns out you can go stealth; but you do need the specific ring combo of Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring and Ring of Fog. This is nonviable as most enemies still see you as they're front-facing. And as a default, you lose benefits of two ring slots for all those enemies.)\n+ Invincibility frames, e.g., during ripostes and backstabs. This makes these actions viable during combat with multiple enemies. Speaking for realism, there's no reason you should use these in a multiple enemy fight.\n\n__Details that don't like:__\n\n+ Opaque NPC quest progression. It's very easy to ruin progression.\n+ Occasionally long runs all the way back to a boss. At least you can [save scum to mitigate this.](https://steamcommunity.com/app/570940/discussions/0/1696049513762633073)\n+ Curses. Half-HP is fine, but the fact that you have to run all the way back to the church is just tedious. Similarly, the limited amount of Transient Curses to make it through New Londo Ruins. I use Cheat Engine to mitigate this.\n+ No respec. You must commit to your build early on, locking yourself from many weapons. I use Cheat Engine to mitigate this.\n+ Because of the limited supply for upgrades (and the somewhat big commit to upgrade an item to +10 or +15 for viability mid and endgame, the game requires you to really commit to one weapon, two at most, within a new game playthrough. This makes it unfortunate that you can't easily experiment and play with all the different weapons.I  use Cheat Engine to mitigate this.\n+ Tools for managing your massive inventory.\n+ Lack of save states for interface resets. You can absolve sin if you accidentally hit an NPC (e.g., I accidentally hit Siegmeyer during the Izalith encounter). However, if you accidentally say no you may lose access to a questline for the full game.\n+ Killing Gwyn automatically starts the new game. This means you can't keep a game state at the end of the game while also having completed all of it.\n+ Contrary to popular belief, [joining another covenant does not actually count as sin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/18gwxe/does_breaking_any_of_the_covenants_ever_qualify) \"Betrayal\" is only certain events or attacking an NPC. The only penalty for leaving a covenant, by any means, is if you have ranked up in the covenant, then your contributions are halved. [Wikidot](http://darksouls.wikidot.com/covenants) is correct and fextralife is wrong.\n+ Multiple enemy targeting system. You must toggle between the single-targeting system and no target to control movement/aim.\n+ No way to practice bosses after beating them. Fortunately, you can mitigate this by backing up save files that are next to fog doors.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Wikidot](https://darksouls.wikidot.com), [Fextralife Wiki](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com), [Souls lore Wikidot](http://soulslore.wikidot.com)\n+ [Iron Pineapple](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC477Kvszl9JivqOxN1dFgPQ)\n+ [DEX Guide for Dummies](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=353066256)\n+ [STR Guide for Dummies](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=357745819)\n+ [Cheat Sheet](https://smcnabb.github.io/dark-souls-cheat-sheet). I always struggle with balancing completionism via walkthroughs and exploring by yourself. Most games are inttended for the latter experience, e.g., Dark Souls has surprises via ambushes, enemy weaknesses, and boss tactics. On the other hand, Dark Souls features permanently missable items, NPC progression, and invsaions. Checklists are the best middleground. Instead of explicit directions, they outline items in an area and still require exploration to find them. They also give warnings about any permanent missables.\n+ [Maps](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/maps)\n+ [Cheat Engine Table](https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?t=6856). As quality-of-life, Cheat Engine is essential to spawn items that are missable or require farming, respec, and infinite upgrade materials that would otherwise be limited.\n\nI played the Dark Souls: Remastered version on PC.\n\nMy first playthrough involved 62 hours. I played a DEX build, where my playstyle involved moving to the enemy's back while dodging or blocking their attacks and then backstabbing. Sword (Uchigatana) and shield (Grass shield) were my weapon of choice in addition to the Black Bow of Pharis for the occasional ranged attack for sniping. If positioning is a concern, I parry and riposte.\n\n+ __Starting class.__ Wanderer.\n+ __Starting item.__ Pendant (which does nothing) as Miyazaki himself recommended it or nothing as the best RPG element.\n\nMy zone progression followed [Fextralife](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Walkthroughs). This was Northern Undead Asylum -> Firelink Shrine -> Undead Burg -> Undead Parish -> Depths -> Blighttown -> Sen's Fortress -> Anor Londo -> Darkroot Garden -> Darkroot Basin -> Valley of Drakes -> New Londo Ruins -> Duke's Archives/Crystal Cave -> Demon Ruins/Lost Izalith -> Catacombs/Tomb of Giants -> Great Hollow/Ashlake -> DLC -> Painted World of Ariamis. This zone progression worked well with exceptions:\n\n+ Because Duke's Archives is before Tomb of Giants, you have to revisit Duke's in order to kill Rhea.\n+ By the time I entered Darkroot Garden and Darkroot Basin, I was highly overleveled. This suggests I should do it before Sen's Fortress.\n+ Lost Izalith as a zone seems best for last, but you get the Sunlight Maggot which is helpful as a lighting tool for Tomb of the Giants.\n+ By the time I entered the Catacombs, I was overleveled.\n\nMy second playthrough was a STR two-handed build. I use my shield to parry when I can and during tricky positioning. No covenant preference. Area-wise, I went the same route as before. It took me 30 hours to complete the game including DLC at level 93. However, for the second half of the game, I did Demon Ruins/Lost Izalith, Catacombs/Tomb of Giants, Duke's Archives/Crystal Cave, and skipped Great Hollow/Ash's Lake and Painted World.\n\nTODOs\n\n+ Replay as caster build with faith/int.\n+ Replay as Paladin build (str/faith).\n+ Replay as pyromancer build.",

    "comments": "Overall it's a fun game. But it doesn't stand out in any particular manner as well as Diablo II did. Diablo 3 unfortunately just won't stand the test of time in any innovations aside from perhaps the idea of making a modern action RPG a casual affair best spent through a good chunk of hours every few months.\n\n__Gameplay/mechanics.__ I like the havoc that seems to be a bit more chaotic than Diablo II, and also the addition of both event quests, chaining kills to get XP bonuses, and destroying boxes to get a speedup. I also like that in maps and bestiary, the Act structure pretty closely follows Diablo II's.\n\nI like the clean UI (although I miss the minimap overlay). I'm not a fan of the WoW-y style graphics though (as opposed to the grungier deathy approach that defines Diablo); it's just too clean.\n\nPlaying this, I'm a bit skeptical about the benefit of all the conveniences from Diablo II. It reminds me of World of Warcraft, where this is very catered to the casual player. And indeed, Diablo 3 seems most successful for players interested in spending a burst of, say, 4-6 hours and then stopping for weeks to months. To one extent, I completely agree with the streamlined design in filtering out nonsensical information such as extraneous stats and needlessly complex skill trees. (Many hardcore RPGs give the impression of complexity, but in meta, there can often be just as few narrow routes that are actually viable. The important quality in a good RPG is not just complexity, but complexity that remains viable and interesting throughout.) Examples:\n\n+ Town portal button instead of scrolls.\n+ Health potion button instead of consumables.\n+ Legendary quality or set piece items appearing on minimap so you don't miss them.\nTotem to teleport back to entrance of dungeon at the very end.\n+ Right-click to reveal powerful items instead of consumable identifying scrolls.\n+ Lack of stat allocations until Paragon, which are resetable.\n+ Ability to remove gems and keep both the item and the gem.\n+ Kanai's cube powers being account-wide (within a season/non-season/hardcore), like other unlockables.\n\nOne interesting note is that while playing campaign on Expert mode, my leveling progression seemed to interestingly well-paced to be at the maximum level of 70 by the end of Act 5 (e.g., I was roughly level 61 at end of Act 4). I don't think this is intentional though; somehow I may have been overleveled where the XP bonus in Expert difficulty seemed to just make me an overpowered monster. This was okay for typical monsters which seemed to scale with my level(?). But many bosses which had a set level were steamrolled in seconds, and it was just laughable that I didn't get to see any of their cool mechanics that I expect the developers spent much energy on.\n\n__Endgame/meta.__ The seasonal aspect is an interesting spin on competitive gaming. It focuses not on a single main, but that you should reroll a character every season (allowing you eventually to play every class). In fact, it only takes up to 3 hours to farm to 70, and you share Paragon levels and Kanai cube powers (but you only get one full Set armor piece during the Season journey). I really really like this strategy towards casual gaming. It is easily my favorite of all online games I've played. The end-game will always be gear grinding, but one you can do at your own pace without any dailies or weeklies. Speed dungeons for dungeons and difficulties are the highest skill tier. PvP is unfortunate in this game as underdeveloped. There isn't much new content that justifies playing season after season however. Adventure mode is interesting. No real cow level where players are interested in farming game after game. I like personal loot. The full thing feels a little antisocial though in that the mechanics carry away much need for any conversation. The Paragon leveling system seems like a great idea (and it's accountwide!), much improved over grinding to a single maximum level cap or the prestige mechanic of Call of Duty games.\n\n__Story.__ It's always been banal but now it's even worse than before, with Leah who doesn't belong in this medieval nightmare, a nonsensical death for Deckard Cain, Diablo being Leah's father... Agree with this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/39hmq2/years_after_the_launch_how_do_you_feel_about_the/cs3g6qq/. I also don't like the cutscenes interspersed throughtout the act---there's not even much going here except for a specifically pased dialogue while a manuscript and some ink is being displayed.\n\n## References\n\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/\n+ https://www.diablofans.com/\n+ http://www.diabloprogress.com/\nGood overview of meta on how to start from 0 to endgame: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZStpNSidcgo\n+ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwbPMZqkxlP0rREbouYj3WXyAgFpJhrKQ\n\nMiscellaneous comments below.\n\n__On population.__ It's unfortunate I only experienced the game 6 years after its making, in its endstate quite a few months after it stayed in maintenance mode. I see literal 10s of players in active games (for seasonal <=T6), and it's difficult to easily join public games at a desired difficulty and type (e.g., bounties vs rifts).\n\n__On classes.__ I played Necromancer. I went with the highest-rated build in patch 2.6.1 (the last patch in Diablo 3 since it went into maintenance mode), which is a [pet build](https://www.diablofans.com/builds/91220-gr-90-blood-for-the-blood-god-pet-build-updated).\n\nInitially to pick a class I got started by watching videos: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fn1ja0TapQ); [2](https://us.diablo3.com/en/game/guide/get-started/choosing-your-class). I chose to roll a Witch Doctor and played only Act 1. (This was the limit before I had to decide if I should pay the $30 battle chest with a seasonal character and following the meta for builds; or just play a different game.) Generic classes aren't as much for me. I prefer choosing the class that has spent the most time and is iconic in uniquely defining the game. (I'll only have one way to experience the game, and I may as well choose the one with the most information content.) I would choose the Necromancer (my favorite in Diablo II for its diverse playstyles including curses, poisons, corpse explosions, minions, bone caster; fun-wise it's tied with Amazon for spamming multi-shots on Cows and Sorceress for spamming frozen orb or fire walls on Cows). But it doesn't seem like it's the same as in Diablo II, where Witch Doctor was originally aiming to serve that path (and Necromancer was added in the future because of its fan favorite). [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/6sa8b0/the_witch_doctor_is_just_a_boneless_necromancer/dle0hkq) Interesting point about the weird state of Witch Doctor given Diablo's original theme of christianity and goth. [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/9vkj3p/will_the_druid_class_show_up_before_diablo_4) Interesting points about Necromancer in Diablo 3 just not being as good as its state in Diablo 2. Although Necromancer was purely added as a fan favorite, [Necromancer is far superior for a pet build than Witch Doctor.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/6znjih/necromancer_pets_vs_witch_doctor_pets_vs_other).",

It's largely instance-based with a linear platformer pathway with goons waiting for you like Halo. And there is no loot per enemy drop where you can choose, e.g., quests and farm rares.\n\nStory is juvenile. I can literally hear the cliches line-by-line.

    "comments": "Black Desert Online excels most as a sandbox with excellent graphics and combat system. It pushes new avenues for character customization, crafting, and combat with manual targeting system and combos reminiscent of fighting games. There are no real stories or raids, but rather the barebones for you to build an empire with your own home.\n\nThe combat reminds me of Diablo and fighting games, where you have a set of attacks you perform via combinations of your mouse and certain keys (usually directional arrows). Unlike a cooldowns and rotations battle system, it is a playground of invincibility frames and animation cancels.\n\nGraphics-wise, it's beautiful statically. The textures and 3D maps are particularly nice. Although of course faces still remain expressionless and there's the annoying \"crop-up\" feature of textures appearing non-seamlessly as you move in the wilderlands.\n\nIts flaws are microtransactions. As a sandbox, it also lacks a community to push for eg the best PvP or PvE compared to other online competitive games. The only PvP are sieges, which are similar to Ragnarok Onlineâs guild wars. Itâs more idling. The story is not very engaging either. It's your prototypical fantasy setting.\n\nI played a Sorceress. Seems to be a fun mix of melee but also with some magic. I only ended up playing for a total of 5 hours (up to level 28 I believe).\n\nDetails I like from Black Desert Online (compared to, e.g., WoW):\n+ Explicit directions via arrows to get to quest objectives. This is built-in and far better functionally than any addon like Carpenter.\n+ Individual mobs that are useful for the quest are highlighted a different color in the minimap.\n+ Can press one keyboard shortcut (\"R\") to zoom by all quest selection options.\n+ Character customization.\n+ Making grinding fun by improving the core combat system and others (I wish they wuold also benefit from Guild Wars' world instance quests).\n+ Wiki links built into website.\n+Great default UI, without a need for a million addons including overhauls like ElvUI in WoW.\n\nThings I'm not sure how to feel about:\n+ Lack of flight paths or portals and the reliance on autorun. I think the idea is nice, but I feel like autorun removes that spectacle of having to manually move around a map.\n+ Lack of explicit directions/tutorials in-game that teach you all its mechanics. It's otherwise a bit immersion-breaking to look up external guides. But then again, those external guides are always more comprehensive than the in-game ones.\n\n## References\n\n+ [Sorceress guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AZY0Bzzbyi2jCfRNser83sS7TIKbQRO5bR4GrZjt4u8/edit)\n+ https://community.blackdesertonline.com/index.php?threads/sorceress-guide.13675/",

    "comments": "__Story.__ DQ5 doesn't have the roaming enemies and semi-turn-based battle system of Chrono Trigger. And DQ5 doesn't have the ensemble cast of FF6. Instead, DQ5 excels most in advancing the story of one character. It defines an epic on his life, much like the Odyssey, from vast jumps in timelines and to his various tribulations (death of his father, slavery, petrification and losing his wife, not finding his mother for a long time).\n\nDQ5 feels more slice-of-life-like in focusing one character, and from the age of a child to an adult, from his relationship with his father, his childhood friends, all the way to marriage. Because of this I actually wish it even more embraced its slice-of-life nature, similar to the Mother series where it isn't so much about saving the world. Rather, DQ5 might focus, for example, on overtaking his kingdom and just end there.\n\nThe story remains a little silly as a fantasy, that there is one hero and his band to save the world, journeying from town to town with dungeons, \"boss fights\", etc. I still find this so implausible to ruin characterization and interesting developments. I only like this stage insomuch as it is set up as a stage for the rest of the storytelling (like Earthbound).\n\nWow at the child slavery for 10 years from 6 to 16. And the death of his father in fromt of his eyes. Now thatâs ome way to end an era before a time skip! Even the idea of escaping a dlavery plantation by hiding in a barrel cramped with three people, whose original intention was to hide dead bodies, is shocking. The twist at the end of Part 2 is excellent as well. Just as life were about to settle on, without ever resolving the grand mystery as he simply resides as a new king with his wife and twin children.\n\nI love that it isnât Abel that's the legendary hero. But his son. It really makes you feel for his family and noy just him as a Mary Sue character.\n\n__Graphics.__ Given that this is developed in 1992, I appreciate the sprite graphics, walls of text as dialogue, and classical MIDI music much like FF6 (1994) and Chrono Trigger (1995). I wish the sprites actually aged. This is a good sign for where graphics can help change the atmosphere, similar to the destroyed world in the second part of FF6.\n\nThe menu interface in DQ5 has not aged well. It's extremely rudimentary and takes so many navigations to organize items and visualize equipment. This is a good example of where I think open-sourced gaming could really help. If all JRPGs built on the same infrastructure, they could reuse the same menu code but of course with options for different stylings, etc.\n\n__Gameplay.__ The battle system is fairly rudimentary, with turn-based combat of attack, magic, items, and fleeing; though there are Tactics that allow monsters in your party to do their own thing, somewhat similar to Chrono Trigger's monsters.\n\nMechanics wise, I really enjoyed how they showed the gruesome death scene of his father (watch the battle go as the minions inch out his HP) and also a way for the preadult Hero to retain the same gear as his child self over 10 years.\n\nMechanics-wise, I like that DQ5 lets you pan around the map, which gives you a feeling that it's quasi 3D. It also uses it to hide certain doors.\n\nFor party construction, I followed monster recruitment rankings from the following: [1](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/942423-dragon-quest-v-hand-of-the-heavenly-bride/75581417); [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/2mqczm/best_dragon_quest_v_party).\n\nFor Part 2, I used: Abel, Slime Knight, Saber, and Slime. Abel is a great all-arounder (heal, AoE spells, Attack) and can equip good materials. Slime Knight is similar to Abel. Saber has a good Attack, and that's about it. Slime has poor stats but I liked his Kabuff (defense+ to all), Kasap (defense- to all) and AoE Attack with Edged boomerang; later I switched Slime with Orc King once i got him. Amazing party member for Kazing (revive) and Heal spells including Multiheal once he levels up.\n\nFor Part 3, I used: Abel, Parry, Slime Knight, and Golem. Parry functions like Abel and Slime Knight, but with absurdly better equipment due to the Zenithian equipment; he's even better by level 30 with both Kazing and Multiheal. Abel is my in-battle reviver. Orc King and Slime Knight are in my wagon for extra heals. I haven't found a good buffer/debuffer so I kept around Slime. As the game progresses, magic just isn't that good and therefore rules out Madchen and Bianca/Nera. For the wagon I typically alternated to level them all upâbut the good ones were generally Madchen (for her Kasap debuff complimenting Parry's Kabuff; and Oomph which doubles a party member's attack), Sancho, Tuppence, Saber. In no parts did I really farm to look for the rarer Monsters that are really good such as Cureslime, Metal Slime, King Cureslime, Gigantes, Great Dragon.\n\nI was level 28 on Abel and could not kill Bishop Ladja. It looks like grinding for exp and gold at Knick-Knack (mudhands and liquid metal slimes in particular) helped a lot. Used a nontypical party for boss fights consisting of Abel, Parry, Madchen, and Slime Knight. [I also just used all my seeds which give stat boosts to Abel.](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/942423-dragon-quest-v-hand-of-the-heavenly-bride/48513590). I ended up beating Ladja and then Bjorn at level 32 on Abel and roughly 29-30 on the rest.\n\nAt endgame, I grinded for Gigantes and Great Dragon. They're found in Nadiria, which seems to be a good place to grind gold (Balhib) and experience. Metal Dragons also have a 1/256 chance of dropping the Metal King Helm, which is the best helm for all who can equip it.\n\nThings to grind/farm/collect: mini-medals (which offer unique items); seeds (which are permanent stat boosters); experience; gold; monsters; best equipment per party member; knick-knacks which are collectibles.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n+ https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-guide-for-getting-into-dragon-quest.64979/\n\nI chose this game as my first Dragon Quest. This follows [a guide](https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-gateway-guide-to-dragon-quest); see also [2](https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/5866-the-complete-beginner-s-guide-to-dragon-quest-part-1-main-titles). I also played the mobile version (iOS), which is based on the DS version's engine; it seems like the DS and mobile versions are the best because they have an extra feature (third wife option). But they pale in comparison to the PS2 version's new 3D graphics. I don't like the mobile ports because they add intrusive interfaces with their clearer non-pixelbased fonts, and some visuals can be proportioned incorrectly.\n\nI beat the game with running gametime of 28:56 hours. Because I didn't want to spend the time, I decided not to finish the post-endgame of grinding to get the absolute best equipment, the last few knick-knacks, and the post-final boss Estark. (Neither did I actually do any of the TnT boards.) Instead, I watched HCBailey's let's play to see the content in these parts.\n\nWalkthroughs I followed: [1](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ds/942423-dragon-quest-v-hand-of-the-heavenly-bride/faqs/56092); [2](http://shrines.rpgclassics.com/snes/dq5/walkthrough.shtml). I like that it gives you prescriptive guides on what levels to be at various stages. It gives you signal on just the amount of grinding you should do (which I don't not enjoy as much as others).",

For example, because you know what the enemy is going to do, it drastically changes up your play on that turn (defends vs pure attacks vs preparation for a massive debuff). I love its combination of Roguelike in Bind of Isaac style as well as energy-cards such as Magic and Hearthstone. For guides: Silent (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eq6nKX_czmxEgV06YSsrl3qAukGa3Z3BtXBWarDdLWA/edit#gid=0, https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1331551053), Ironclad (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1270902550, https://spirelogs.com/stats/ironclad/tierlist.php). I also watched quite a few of JoINrbs's \"overexplaining X\" guides on Youtube.\n\nFor play styles per character, I like to first, play the game without any guides; second, follow set-in-stone guides first to get an understanding of the basic metagame; third, follow tier lists to get a basic understanding of the cards and follow my own wisdoms; fourth, learn more in-depth the metagame of what the viable styles are.\n\nMy favorite part of roguelikes is the ability for games to be so varied, and sometimes hilariously ridiculous based on catapulting on one really amazing event (e.g., Necromancer tome) or one really amazing relic (e.g., Snock Eye has 2 extra cards with confusion, which makes you then prioritize the most expensive-energy cards as well as as many Plunder Strikes which do damage and draw 2 cards) or one deck-defining card (Searing Blow). Some events are really worth gambling such as the Knowing Skull which you can spend literally all of your HP to get as many relics and colorless cards as possible.",

I really enjoyed my time taking a break from work. Writing this on July 7, 2018, after having played 3 days straight, I love the long days of just playing for 14+ hours and then when going to sleep having these shivers from insomnia and also thinking that everything looks like the animations from Dead by Daylight. All great. Also watching the streams (I had initially even found DbD by watching Sodapoppin play a random game, and I thought this one was interesting. Then I saw TrueTalent's youtube channel and proceeded to marathon a few of the videos even though I never actually played the game.)\n\nIt's repetitive though, and the perks like Call of Duty can strongly determine the best. And while I do love some of the skill involvedâthe meta, the juking, the map/pallet awarenessâit seems like the game is made so that you can easily pick it up, and the bar for the highest skill is honestly not that much. The differences are subtler (particularly for Survivors), as it's highly reliant on their performance as well. In addition, the chat system leaves much to be desired. Post-game chat only with the Killer is only asking to make the divide between the two teams further, as well as hugely toxic chat from people being very salty. Would in-game chat work instead?\n\nThe ladder, and matchmaking system, are all barebones and with much to be desired compared to other heavy duty games like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft. And certain meta constantly remaining OP: as of this date, survivors with friends which have the additional feature of voice chat (https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/7xpskr/dead_by_daylights_concept_is_inherently_flawed_it/), Hex Ruin, Decisive Strike. I can see why SWF is a money maker to keep the game here. But it ruins the whole concept of imperfect information and horror.\n\nI'm very fond of Dead by Daylight's bloodpoints system, where they encourage players to have a diverse strategy, e.g., for survivors by generators vs saving people vs juking the killer vs surviving.\n\nIn terms of content, I found the asymmetrical team-vs-one game, and also the spin on killers and survivors (and even the lore) to all be refreshing.\n\nThis juking guide is super useful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJCuAFssn7s. I wish I had time to engrain all of that knowledge!\n\nThe procedural generated maps is interesting. It's not nearly as intelligent as you can really do with machine learning these days. This is likely just a deterministic formula with a select number of locations and constraints for generators, map structures, hooks, and hex totems in each realm.",

It provides no way of furthering out truth from lies and deception. It's a weird therapeutic tool oftentkmes, just thrown into cases to make her feel useful to the plot.\n\ncase 2 is incredibly stale. Characterings are boring, mystery just drags on and is uncompelling.\n\nEnd justifies the means debate. So half baked in ethical issues just like JFA.\n\nNew logistical mechanics are nice. For example, I love the new anime style for video animation in the cut scenes. A significant improvement over the awkward CGI in Apollo Justice. I also like the reading log, which makes it subscribe more to ots visual novel genre and helps practically in keeping track with some of the fast dialog. I have to admit the whole 3D rendering of sprites and backgrounds kept me disoriented for a while as all the prefious games did 2D. This is a whole new dimension (literally)! Wish it could switch from english dubbing to original Japanese though. English dubbing in a Japanese game always feels so forced,  ot necessarily because of the premise of the idea but that English dubbing often forces specific English cultural nuances that are just incorrect (such as a lack of a moe voice and better seiyuu industry). I like how dialog and movement is a lot more organic, where instead of a list of chat optioms they arise sequentially from the conversations, and often one automatically moves to the next relevant scene.\n\nThe DLC episode is easily one of my favoriate in this game (and the series). Great characters, spunky scenarios and individual budgetized scenes, I even learned a bit about orcas from this. Had not expected the villain given his friendly character and even his relationship with Pearls. And how after much teasing about cross examining an animal you get to eventually do it again! And the ending, finally one that isnt canonically about evil masterminds.\n\nI followed this guide.\nhttps://strategywiki.org/wiki/Phoenix_Wright:_Ace_Attorney_-_Dual_Destinies",

I can see why popular opinion does not like the story as it both takes spotlight away from Phoenix and cast but also doesn't give sole attention to the new cast of Apollo. It's a funny hybrid that didn't really mix well. That said, I enjoyed the refreshing new takes and while taken just as a general storyline treating both Apollo and Phoenix equally as the main characters, it's a pretty fun story.\n\nIt's kind of unfortunate Apollo and Trucy are playing at the exact same dynamic as Phoenix and Maya. Apollo in general doesn't stand out much beyond the previous Phoenix. His mannerisms and thought processes are also all the same due to the way of writing (e.g., straight man role taking the blunt of most eccentrics, parenthetical comments, stupidly rash outbursts). There's also little difference in mechanics, with the Magatama vs Perceive and magician vs medium.\n\nI do like the unique father-daughter dynamic in that Phoenix acts somewhere between that and a good friend. While Apollo is listed as the main character, it's more like him and Phoenix jointly in terms of all the characterization. Indeed, even the last case is like this, where the climax seems really in the investigation phases rather than the trial phase. In general it seems a common pattern in the games that the prosecutors change antics, but the defense (and moreover playable) side remains the same. I like how this game's prosecutor is less antsy about personal vendettas as all previously have been and is more about simply returning the truth. I can see how he's less characterized than other prosecutors in the game thuogh, as more spotlight is placed on his older brother. Maybe this split in all the spotlights did not enable enough individual attention.\n\nI like the idea of the bracelet. The music and slowdown is really awesome. Or maybe it's because I got sick of the Magatama as more of the same old mechanic, but just available during the investigation stages. Here the mechanic itself is different. (It also remains just as unbelievable as spirit channeling.) Forensics gimmicks were fun and helped reminisce about Ashes, the best case of all.\n\nThe option to skip text flow is amazing. Thank you so much for letting me zoom by the story at my own pace (I may have finished the game 2x as fast because of this). I get that the scrolling text is deliberately paced with various emphases. But I only wish the relative speeds might remain the same, and we can alter the magnitude. After all, I'm a faster reader than the average, and this is of personal taste. I also love the ability to quickly thumb through the testimony during crossexaminations.\n\nOn individual cases: Oh man, that second case. How wildly Japanese. I enjoyed the characters, although the yakuza girl plot is kind of predictable. The third case on music was okay, only faulty in that playing the song many times was ingratiating and all the characters were not eccentric enough or stand out enough.\n\nI like that the whole introduction of the Jurist system did not get too preachy about the values pf cour systems and how decisive evidence should be considered. It is not nearly as overbearing hear as Justice for All.\n\nI followed this guide:\n[1] https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Apollo_Justice:_Ace_Attorney",

I particularly like how it changes viewpoints so different characters are playable, and that so many recurring characters come back to life as a conclusive trilogy.\n\nThat said, the individual writings have flaws. The theft plot was interesting only in that the crime was not murder. it and the other middle story were pretty stale, just your typical Phoenix Wright story. Plot holes are the bane to taking any phoenix wright mystery too seriously, especially when one can simply go around with the magatama and ask if the person committed the crime. I hugely miss the first game's soundtrack during the cross examinations; I felt like it played it best due to its rhythm with the scrolling text.\n\nWhile I like that Trials and Tribulations recasts a bunch of past characters in the last turnabout, it's kind of unfortunate that Edgeworth still must rely on magical hijinks to be a defense attorney. I only wish the gameplay mechanics were different (another element for why Rise of Ashes is the best turnabout). The twin sisters reveal was already bad enough. Now all the medium hijinks on body swapping, Godot being in a deep coma for 5 years, that Godot could contact Misty Fey, Phoenix dating Iris for 6 months, and holding total suspension of belief in court of justice, it's all too much. It's not a good mystery at all, and the character building and stprt is just too forced with all these connections to make it fell any authenticity.\n\n[1] https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Phoenix_Wright:_Ace_Attorney_-_Trials_and_Tribulations\n\nI'll miss you strategywiki.

Story is overly cheesy and writing is not really that innovative. But the gameplay scenarios are pretty fun.\n\nOn the Arcade. It's infuriating that you can't see how many players are in a lobby until after you join in it. Overall, the wait time to start a game is significantly longer, and also the loading screen. I like that you can join a lobby while still browsing other games. I also like the significantly more customizability, better native support for finding what are the most popular games and downloading them, and no ridiculous bugs like someone not pressing Start in the objectives screen. But the lack of easily starting a game is easily the weakest point and is why SC2 Arena is so underplayed compared to SC1. I agree with the sentiment overall in Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/jui3g/why_did_the_fun_brood_war_umscustom_games_like/): no collective skill and friendship over many remade games; no custom titles and thus pro only and unique games.\n\nWhy did SC2 Arcade fail badly? One is logistics of the terrible support Blizzzard did. I also agree with this Youtube discussion (https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/5tqfpf/sc2_arcade_vs_use_map_settings_a_discussion_of/) that perhaps other big reasons are that in Starcraft days, there were no alternative options for hardcore game designers to build their own game under more engines; and for casual players, the Galaxy Editor is just too intense compared, to say, Starcrafts and without a gradual learning curve.",

Reviewing the documents of these people coming through and balancing their specific stories, needs, and wants against that of your own is an incredibly immersive way to draw you into this world.\n> The addition of the timer and the monetary system basically put you in a place where the more you start to question everything around you, the worse it makes you feel and more your realize the gravity of just what is happening.\n>\n> I think that's an incredible contrast to other games with moral systems. For instance, a game like \"KOTOR\" asks you to make very clear good or evil choices on, relatively, your own time. It then reacts in bold ways accordingly.\n\n> \"Papers, Please\" doesn't offer that same luxury. What exactly constitutes good, evil, or something in between in this title is entirely dependent on the morality of the user themselves. The fact that someone can play this game and never question the moral implications of what they are doing, and have that still be a comment on their morality is a great example of its brilliant implementation of morality into the game.\n>\n> \"Papers, Please\" is one of my favorite games of this year and likely far beyond that.

This game is inconsistent in gameplay; Reunion, Turnabout was a little crazy and obvious; Turnabout Big Top basically gave up on the use of Psyche-Locks and with no good characters. Contrived, and much obscure wanding around remote events. I liked the use of 2-1 as both a tutorial and segway as a mini-trial series. But man that trial is so obvious it's dull. I miss the previous series' soundtrack during the testimonies. Franziska is also quite a weak rival as she's so dull and lacking in characterization; she just whips everyone, lies all the time, and gets away with nonsense.\n\ni dislike how there are always leaps of logic one must take in any of the cases. there are always spternative possibilities and holes in the logic that one must suspend disbelief. the characters can also be rather shallow. rarely do they get further chracterized. we hardly know much about phoenix for example.\n\nIt's a minor detail, and I think this happens in the first game too, but I love that they sometimes play with the text speed. At rare occasions, it goes very punctuated and slow for emphasis or drolls on without the player having to hit a button to go to the next thing; the latter emphasizes a rant.\n\nFarewell, my Turnabout has poorer characters (and very few so you can deduce te killer by elimination) but the connections to previous characters, use of Maya as a playable character and the magatama, as well as the twist, all made it somewhat good. However, all the meandering on a basic moral principle gets tiresome so quickly. And it even has a cop out at the end too. I wish the bad ending were the true ending! Phoenix Wright should either not dabble in deeper themes or it should truly carry them out and execute the inevitable ending: Phoenix prioritizing truth over the client, thus killing Maya, or alternatively, Phoenix prioritizing the client over truth, thus saving Maya but destroying his principles. One minor quip in addition: They start off the case with the magatama as reliance on whether their client killed anyone; they should always use that if it's always correct! Super powers begone. I realize my opinion of 2-4 is a minority opinion in the community, the majority of which think that it is one of the best in the series. Here's another opinion agreeing with some of my points (I also enjoy the discussion): http://tay.kinja.com/a-lawyer-revisits-phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-justic-1695273699 I especially enjoy this quote:\n\nLawyers are hated in society for representing the unlikable or those who are âclearlyâ in the wrong, but this hate exists only because people donât appreciate or understand why we have lawyers in the first place. Both the prosecutor and the defense attorney - and lawyers who represent insurance companies, and lawyers who represent patent trolls, and government attorneys who have to argue against same-sex marriage because their governor is conservative - are cogs in a much larger machine. We have a job to do. We perform a function. You might think that lawyers are dishonest and help people lie... until you need a lawyer, and âlyingâ becomes âhelping me tell my side of the story.â\n\nBeing an attorney - especially a defense attorney - isnât about picking the âright sideâ and only accepting cases from that side. A defense attorney is not gonna get to represent the innocent party every single time. Thatâs what makes case 2-4 such a missed opportunity. Instead of challenging the playerâs concept of defense lawyers and teaching them about the profession, it actually plays into the negative stereotype. The moral ambiguity of Phoenixâs decision isnât given enough space to exist in the first place; Mayaâs kidnapping absolves him of all responsibility for representing Engarde in the eyes of the audience. And the writersâ message here - that the âcorrectâ decision for Phoenix to make is to prioritize the âtruthâ over the requirements of his job - is wrong. That is not what a defense attorney does, and itâs borderline degrading to people whose job it is to uphold criminalsâ rights regardless of their guilt.\n\nMan, in general Justice for All makes it clear just how well done the original game is in its turns and twosts in its case storyline and its excellent supporting characters\n\n[1] http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Phoenix_Wright:_Ace_Attorney_-_Justice_For_All",

I really enjoyed that the second half was so different, and that it was about rising again with heavy character-building. My only complaint is that relative to other mediums, this character-building is incredibly shallow, with only 5-10 minutes worth of scenes that do such building. Granted, this is far more than a typical JRPG but not nearly big enough.\n\nThe gameplay, while not necessarily innovative, was solid. Magicite, and the ability to use all playable characters well, are fun.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI completed everything excluding the addon content with Dragons' Den. Given that my experience with Kefka's Tower was Ultima spamming, and having read the Dragons' Den walkthroughs, I feel it'd be more or less mechanical without a tangible reward (in terms of plot thickening or characterization).\n\n[1] http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VI\n[2] http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Walkthrough:Final_Fantasy_VI\n[3] http://www.cavesofnarshe.com/ff6/walkthrough.php?chapter=1-37\n[4] https://www.gamefaqs.com/snes/554041-final-fantasy-iii/faqs/59823\n\n [1] is most useful for general information about the game such as its historical context, synopsis, and high-level gameplay info. I used both [2] and [3] as I played through the game; both were terrible in that they tried to crack terrible jokes all the time (it's obvious they were written by teenagers) and varied in detail, e.g., [2] often described specific directions to get chests and [3] was more comprehensive at times when [2] simply did not mention something such as specific side quests. I love that the wiki has the ai script and also that the other has the specific encounter rate and formation. They also miss certain details that the other covers (I do not know if both missed something!); for example, [2] details Shadow's dreams and [1] details some chests and key items to steal such as for the Colosseum. The order I went through also departed drastically at times from theirs during the second half. In retrospect, I think the true ordering is based on bestiary levels, e.g., http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/554041-final-fantasy-iii/64065632",

(for example, starmen.net's earthbound guide is excellent; as is strategywiki's phoenix wright guide; but ive not found a good ff6 guide).\n\nOne thing ive also found curious is the amount of summary content in the game. this is of course done for casuals who play cases piecewise and can tend to forget major events. but there is so much of it also within a day of investigation or trial that im not sure whther to 'dock points' off for.\n\nI love the characters. The Pheonix-Maya duo remind me of another pair, the detectives from Darker than Black. It's not that the characters are similar or even the dynamic involved with them. But it's the shear dynamic that makes it so excellent and lovable.\n\nI love the last two. Rise of Ashes is especially my favorite.\n\n[1] http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Phoenix_Wright:_Ace_Attorney\n\n[1] was a great guide; no complaints.",

I also liked the dyes for customization (as opposed to WoW's transmog, which is inherently reliant on older good looking gear). The world events were really well done as opposed to WoWâs questing system. I also liked its art style. Its fatal flaw is a lack of vanilla WoW's social aspects with partying and guilds. Other major flaws are a lack of solo queue rated, lack of strong lore like WoW, PvE raids, and anything to really keep the player tied to the game such as WoWâs sidemissions such as professions and the million things to optimize/farm.\n\nI stopped playing the game before it was introduced, but I heard Guild Wars 2 perfected the mount system for MMOs.

The game is so great simply because of the way it presents and ties everything together.\n\nQuoting a random GameFAQs guy in a forum, '...were these 'unique characteristics' really so unique that the characters were the best ever? Ayla's speech style had been done in another major Square game of the time... Gau in Final Fantasy 6 had a similar manner of speaking, and outside of videogames, so did Tarzan, a character well known for over a century. Robo was pretty cliche, the whole robot finding a friend and becoming more human had been done before. Isaac Asimov wrote a lot of stories involving human-like robots. The character's don't really stand out in any major way.\n\nAnd bingo, the gameplay is what made it so well known. And the graphics, some of the best on the SNES (those who think it is the best on the SNES... a Japan-only RPG called Tales of Phantasia would like to have a word with you). The soundtrack was catchy and accessible and very, very memorable, although I'd hesitate to call it one of the best videogame soundtracks ever (Earthbound, Final Fantasy VI, and Chrono Cross would like to have a word with you). Monster design was pretty good, although there were quite a few recycled sprites in there :p. Character design was great, even though the similarity to DragonBall characters was annoying, and the illustrations were really cool. It's a shame Toriyama doesn't draw like that all the time...'",

    "comments": "When I originally played, my favorite classes were Sorceress, Amazon, and Necromancer.I played almost all classes: Barbarian, Sorceress, Amazon, Necromancer, Druid, Assassin. I remember first playing Diablo II in Nickel Nickel (of course contemplating for a while on a name and ending up going with DarkKiller7) and starting with an Assassin. I didn't like its trap mechanics. I liked the complexity of the Druid and shapeshifting, but it didn't fit my style. I started to converge onto Sorceress, Amazon, and Necromancer as ranged DPS with some variety. Boy were they all fun as my mains. Barbarian was fun with whirlwind and leap, but it was a bit boring to play. Paladin is also quite fun as a buff party member in early game and the OP Hammerdin lategame.\n\nThe problems:\n+ Hacks with exploits, duping, custom gear that became mainstream (white ring? lol)\n+ With the state of internet at the time, and lack of secure features, learning about the above was through hearsay and which often resulted in the opposite effect: scams and exploits where if you were to, e.g., pick up your dead corpse but with an item on your naked body, all your items would drop as you loot and someone can pick them all up.\n+ Tedious reliance on someone to rush your character through campaign Hell if you wanted to start a character afresh and start powerleveling via Baal Hell and Cows.\n\n+ [The Arreat Summit](http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp)\n+ [A brief patch history](https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo2/comments/bqah0p/diablo_ii_a_brief_patch_history) | I recall playing during, say, version 1.07-1.09 where Amazon had Guided Arrow + Pierce, Barbarians were popular, and Paladins were rare. I also recall runewords, playing early into version 1.10-1.14, but not yet when Javazon became the dominant Amazon build, Barbarians became the worst class, and Hammerdins became the most popular.",

    "comments": "Morrowind carries out the core vision of the series: environment interaction; open worlds; quests with a main story, faction, and miscellaneous; and a deep progression system. Unlike other games in the series, Morrowind stands out with its world-building with unique, sometimes alien landscapes and cities; weird and wonderful creatures (but bland humans); the best progression-system with attributes and spell variety (including spellmaking); and excellent quests across the board: the main quest is decent, guild quests comprise routine jobs and ascending ranks which feels very believable, and side quests are well-told and with a wide variety of gameplay objectives and styles. The scale of impact is also far-reaching, where joining factions locks you from another, the books and dialogue add huge depth and realism, and NPCs can love or hate you depending on your actions. It's the ultimate game with consequences, limitations, and rewards.\n\nFor the first time in the series, Morrowind introduced refined 3D environmnents, the iconic item sets, bestiary, and a main quest that interweaved with side quests.\n\nFlaw-wise, like all Elder Scrolls games, Morrowind has mediocre combat; a significant amount of bugs; and lazy level designs with asset reuse across towns, houses, and dungeons. Unique to Morrowind (and which carried over to Oblivion), the attribute bonuses system causes an unintuitive leveling experience where you must artificially level up certain skills in order to get attribute bonuses during the next level up.\n\n__Gameplay & Combat.__ The variety is great. The non-leveled system was perfect. I liked having characters become so broken after many hours of playtime that they're gods. For example, I have fond memories of leveling up acrobatics so high that I effectively fast travel by jumping from city to city; or jumping still so high that it takes minutes to fall down.\n\nIconic to the game's gameplay is first-person clunky combat, following quests through descriptions (i.e., no quest markers), paused menu healing with potions, deliberate travel without fast travel, and constant saving in order to be ambitious in attempts and experience different reactions.",

It's automatic and in a time where the Nintendo 64 controller does not have a right analog stick for manual camera control. (Super Mario 64 was better, but its use of the C-stick wasn't as fluid as the modern approach of a right analog stick.)\n\nI played via the Project 64 emulator on PC and using a Gamecube controller.",

    "comments": "REPLAYED: X/X/X - X/X/X\n\nOddworld is a sidescrolling puzzle platformer with a unique spin: Abe's a weakling lacking in both defense and offense. The story shares undertones of anti-consumerism, with the death animations being hilarious and a variety of dark comedy being featured in the grungy enslaved facility. This requires Abe to evade rather than defeat enemies, including sneaking, running, possession, and turning the environment against them. In addition, the enemies are diverse and story is fun. The overall environment and audiovisuals are serviceable. I like the optional challenge of saving all Mudukons, although I have mixed opinions about the 99 number without any progression rewards.\n\nAbe's Odysee is one of the earliest console games with quicksave-like/quickload options. [When exactly it saves however is convoluted: it's not as simple as just a checkpoint-based save system or a fully manual save system](https://steamcommunity.com/app/15700/discussions/0/606068060817179612/).\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ [Controller support on PC sucks](https://steamcommunity.com/app/15700/discussions/0/620700961056630458). You can't use LT/RT or D-pad; start menu is arbitrarily set to L3, and you have to press ENTER on your keyboard to save games. [Fortunately, the community found a third-party solution.](https://steamcommunity.com/app/15700/discussions/0/1457328927830941716)\n+ No native support for widescreen (pillarboxed) or windowed/borderless. I tried Dxwnd to get it windowed but it couldn't upscale from its original 640x480 resolution. DDHack works for pillarboxing widescreen resolutions and supports borderless!",

It defined real-time strategy with so many difficult decisions with a constantly growing learning curve over years: macro, micro, unit and building control given constraint of 12 unit selection and 12 hotkeys, map domaination, minimap monitoring, beginning to late game play, rushes, abilities, the incredibly varied tactics.\n\nFor me personally, Use Map Settings has a soft spot in my nostalgia part of my brain having played this when I was in middle school. Custom mapping was so hugely popular in SC1 that it spawned several genres and game types. Long after non-hardcore competitors tired of the game's core RTS gameplay, they were able to log onto Bnet and sample arguably the widest variety of user-made content in the history of PC gaming. The highly varied, player-involved customization both in making new maps and playing them has lead to so many creative and amazingly fun games: Cat and Mouse, Dragon Ball Z (and similar) RPGs, tower defenses such as Poker D, Tarpit D, Maze D, Nazi D, and Build Your Own Lurker D, Dragon Ball Budoaki fighting games, Snipers, Helms Deep, Evolves, Rescue the Hostages vs Terrorists, Who's the Murderer, Bounds, RP maps, Cops and Robbers, Nuke the Whale, Kings and Knights, Dodge the Rapist. They would exploit game mechanics such as zergling burrowing to escape walls, gathering minerals for workers to glide against each other, how even the AI in movement such as with valkyries would lead to changes to the meta, scarab pathing, using allied enemies to make up sniper games, using dying units to define bound paths, beacons for powers, hacking mpqs to get new music.\n\nLots of minor annoyances: mission objective people not pressing start; lagged games; no speaking during 'Drop Players'; sometimes when players lose UMS, they are forced to leave under failed mission, which makes it difficult for them to rejoin the same game rehosted; no chat log to see text before it disappears; incredibly steep trial and error or 'host tells everyone' learning curves; leaving a lobby too early which forces list of games not to refresh for a while (this was fixed in the remastered/2017 updates).\n\nHonestly, I find it surprising that Starcraft could become such a defining eSport in the millenium. It's more like Chess than a team game such as Lol analogous to football. That there are so many people fascinated by Starcraft skills means there truly is potential to intelligent game-playing (combined with an amazing amount of actions per minute).\n\nPlaying the Remastered version on Mac. I love the map editor for learning intracies of use map settings games (especially hidden secrets). The native map editor isn't available on Mac. I used a Wine port of SCDraft 2 (http://www.stormcoast-fortress.net/cntt/software/scmdraft/wine-example).",

I dabbled but never spent days playing game after game in multiplayer FPS titles.\n\nAfter thoroughly enjoying Overwatch, there are a lot of interesting ideas in Team Fortress 2 that haven't appeared in other games. To be fair, I enjoy Overwatch's main pitch more: it's less of a death match, there are fewer players in a match, and time to kill is higher. But there are so many core ideas that came from TF2: modes such as payload and capture point with mechanics like overtime, classes, the lootbox system, the cartoon aesthetic, the pricing model of a one-time purchase.",
