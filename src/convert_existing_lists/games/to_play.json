With that said, its dated visuals and archaic gameplay based on a button-combo system like Legend of Dragoon may sour your experience. According to this [order guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/bfoth2/a_recommended_order_to_play_the_xeno_games), this is the first game and a good entrypoint to future entries in the overall series like Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenosaga.\n\nI played a ROM with the [Undub patch](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/5284). I played on RetroArch Beetle PSX HW, the same emulator when I played Castlevania SOTN and Tenchu. I used these [Xenogears-specific settings](https://www.reddit.com/r/XenoGears/comments/oz1x3s/xenogears_in_4k60_with_pixel_perfect_sprites_pc)",

Love the controls from moving around with sprint/super sprint/crouch/jump to vehicle controls. There's significant fun just in moving from point A to point B in the linear missions. Gameplay forces you to eat. Stats.\n\nThe overall sandbox is bloated and filled with empty locations. Not surprising for its time.\n\nDifficulty can be a bit much. There's no checkpoints during missions, and the death penalty is harsh: you lose all your items and a bit of money.\n\nGameplay mechanics do incentivize violence and law-breaking to an awkward degree: it's easier to drive like a madman than follow lights and park properly; most animations are centered around guns and killing people.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Hard to evaluate the graphics at this time. The voice acting, gesticulations, soundtrack, and general atmosphere do make it feel hip It's surprisingly well-animated.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Bike controls are top notch: simple and intuitive yet almost as detailed as even bike trick video games: accelerate/accelerate faster/decelerate, lean on front vs back pedal, slow down/make skid marks as you steer, bunnyhop and even harder.\n+ Quest waypoint use a triangle which points down or up to point out the verticality. Holy shit, that's revolutionary for such an early game! All games should account for something like this.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ N/A\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ If you fail a mission, and I often do as I try to figure out the new minigame controls when it gives you directions in terms of JOY numbers which is not clear with an Xbox controller, you have to spend the 3 minutes to get back to that spot.\n+ Native aspect ratio support is 4:3 (16:9 gets stretched). No borderless.\n+ Can't pause during cutscenes.\n+ Controls in tutorials show JOYX instead of the natural Xbox One controller icons. This means I have to refer to an [external guide to know controller controls or otherwise use keyboard and mouse](https://www.grandtheftwiki.com/Controls_for_GTA_San_Andreas). [Even mouse has issues whener you alt-tab back into the game.](https://steamcommunity.com/app/12120/discussions/0/846960628210850291) Fortunately SilentPatch fixes the latter.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI played with keyboard and mouse. For more modern controls, I remapped Run/Sprint to Shift and Jump to Space.\n\nOriginally I played on 11/28/19 and only got to the Cesar Vialpando low-rider mission before I gave up. Death penalty was too harsh for me. The next time I played with mods on the [downgraded 1.0 release](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=382583124), which is the most mod-compatible. In particular, I installed [CLEO and GXT Hook](https://www.gta-modding.com/san_andreas/tutorials/install_cleo_mods.html), [SilentPatch](https://cookieplmonster.github.io/mods/gta-sa/#silentpatch), [save anywhere mod](https://gtaforums.com/topic/868771-iiivcsa-save-anywhere), [widescreen fix](https://thirteenag.github.io/wfp#gtasa) for non-pillar boxed 16:9, and [windowed mod](https://gtaforums.com/topic/865138-windowed-mode) for borderless.

I played on Dolphin emulator, and on Kids difficulty. Apparently Kids is already hard and can be frustrating, and Adult and further is even worse. I wanted to play it safe as you can't change difficulty after you start nor can you skip cutscenes, and you don't see the real difficult until roughly Chapter 5 as it ramps up and with infrequent save points. I'm not sure I want to go through the frustration of mastering Viewtiful Joe mechanics. I'm here more for the experience; I'd reserve higher difficulties for future playthroughs, particularly on games I love such as Doom and Dark Souls.",

I first watched Vigors play Chapter 2 on Sodapoppin's stream on 8/22/20. Some of the puzzles solutions are pretty arbitrary. It's never clear when something is solvable, and when you should wait later (e.g., the order to complete mirrors, the painting arrangement solution). I'm so glad I didn't play this chapter which was much more puzzle-intensive than scary, compared to Chapter 1.",

    "comments": "Nethack defined roguelikes more than even Rogue did. It also set the standards for emergent gameplay.\n\n__Emergent gameplay.__ The emergent gameplay has three major innovations standing the test of time: a player verb (action) system, enemies and NPCs as players themselves, and the number and variety of nouns (objects). Player verbs, enemies, and objects all work together to create the systemic game.\n\nMost games interact by asking you to select a thing and then decide how to interact with it. This might be a single interact button to click on a door to open it, or with multiple options given an object (e.g., in Project Zomboid, you can open/close window, climb through, walk to, and dig with hands). Nethack's system is the opposite. You select among a large fixed set of verbs and which are applicable to arbitrary objects (e.g., loot, name, pay, open, eat, kick, rub, wield). This makes the learning curve difficult in that with the object-first approach, you immediately know how an object can be interacted with rather than applying a bunch of buttons to see what's (in)valid. It's an extension of [text adventures](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Text_adventure) where commands are things like \"Look under the rug\" and \"Put the key on top of the refridgerator\".\n\nOn the other hand, the power of the verb-first approach is emergence. Experimentation with object-verbs leads to unique interactions: for example, eat ring, throw money, put on not a pair of glasses but a towel so you can avoid being petrified by medusas. Consider a potion. You can quaff (drink) it, but this is dangerous if the potion is unidentified. So you might try throwing one so enemies are your guinea pig. Or you can dip items in it, dilute them with water, or even drop them so enemies pick up and drink them so you can identify them. Not all verbs are applicable to all objects: you can't drink a book, talk to a wall, soldier ants can't read magic scrolls, and you can't eat a ring (in human form). That said, over decades, Nethack developers have handcrafted incredibly complicated responses to rare situations.\n\nEnemies and NPCs are the same as players in that they can do all the types of verbs you can do such as pick up items, be bribed to leave you alone, or even be romanced. You can also eat them to gain their powers or wield their corpses as weapons. Nurses will hit stubborn patients who refuse to disrobe but will heal naked patients. Leprechauns will steal your money and throw it away, and a viable strategy against them is to drop your money somewhere out of reach before engaging with them. Even violent enemies can differ from just hitting you, e.g., the Kraken will attempt to drown you.\n\nObjects are various and with multiple use cases. A can of grease can protect players from grabbing attacks if applied to armor; protect contents from water damage if applied to containers; protect spellbooks, scrolls, or potions from blanking and dilution if applied to them; untrap squeaky boards; and any grease-applied item may slip when you attempt to throw it. Swords rust in water. Potions will boil and explode when you're hit by flame. There are even special interactions: for example, if you have a magical bag that holds more than its physical dimensions would suggest, putting a wand of magic cancellation in it will explode the bag.\n\nFrom what I've seen so far, most of the emergent gameplay arises from item interactions. Emergent improvements could be made in the following.\n\n+ Combat itself is only tactical insomuch as preparation and positioning matter. The actual combat does not vary as you just press forward and the game does a rote Attack verb. Like Noita's spells, Dwarf Fortress' body part damage, Dark Souls' timing and endurance, the core combat loop could be significantly richer and emergent. For example, you could have attacks take up multiple tiles so you can damage multiple enemies at a time, or different varieties of spells with fire speeds, spell radius, and status effects.\n+ There's also not much environment interaction like in Deus Ex, where you can stack crates or throw bottles to distract a guard. Also see Divinity 2's environmental effects.\n\n__RPG elements.__ Build. Level. Gear progression.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The no-sound text-tile ASCII surprisingly ages well. It's easy to mod the game with a tileset.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ N/A\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ N/A\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ N/A\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [nethack.alt.org](https://alt.org/nethack)\n+ [NETHACK: The dev team thinks of everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjuTyJlgLJ8).
