    "comments": "Mankind Divided is like a derivative of Human Revolution. It doesn't do enough new and its serviceable story and characters make for an enjoyable albeit forgettable experience.\n\n__Story.__ A government espionage story with sabotage and racism against augments. It's not a story I find quite interesting as it's done many times over.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Most of the gameplay is the same as Human Revolution: the stealth loop with an enemy detection system, open level designs, upgradeable weapons, a hacking minigame, and a collectible incentives for exploration, where Praxis Kits and XP serve as the form of RPG progression. Crafting is new. New augmentations including experimental augmentations with an overheat mechanic.\n\nLevel design is gorgeous and large with lots of detail. It feels like streets from a real city. As a consequence, it can be difficult to explore and find meaningful content however (e.g., side missions). Different parts are emphasized depending on main campaign progression, and it's all open for little reason.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Customizable HUD. For (lossless) immersion, I set all bars such as health to Timed Fade Out.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ N/A\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ There still isn't an indicator for whether your Ghost bonus is no longer active. It can be hard to tell if something you did triggered it to fail, encouraging an unfun playstyle of save scumming.\n+ Object pickup outlines are way too intrusive compared to Human Revolution. And if you turn it off, it's much harder to find the objects that provide you ammo and other resources.\n+ Aiming sensitivity when scoped is significantly lower than when not zoomed in. You can't set the scoped sensitivity.\n+ Ragbody physics is annoying to move bodies. Just let Jensen carry them over their shoulder like Thief.\n+ Dialogue options use a dialogue wheel with no one-handed keyboard shortcuts.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ [Side Missions](https://www.ign.com/wikis/deus-ex-mankind-divided/Side_Missions)\n\nI played on Medium (Give Me a Challenge) difficulty. Like Human Revolution, it only scales stats: player health, player health/energy regen, and enemy health and accuracy. So it doesn't affect stealth detection or enemy AI aggression. A more difficult experience would rather be HUD-less, which I can always experiment with later in a playthrough or future playthroughs. I played blind.\n\nI did a non-lethal stealth/hacking playthrough, killing on emergencies rather than savescumming (I still do to an extent). I favored non-lethal takedowns for ammo followed by tranq rifle and stun gun headshots (same max of +30 XP as takedown, unlike Human Revolution); 10mm pistol for distractions; and revolver or Typhoon for bosses. Augmentation-wise, I prioritized new options (e.g., Hacking, Heavy Lifting, Jump Enhancement, Punch Through Walls, Social Enhancer, Rebreather, Remote Hacking).",

    "date_finished": "",
    "comments": "\n\n__Gameplay.__ The core gameplay loop involves navigating an area, killing enemies, and collecting keycards, weapons, and other resource pickups. Like the Build Engine iconic trio of Blood, Duke Nukem 3D, and Shadow Warrior, Ion Fury features many hitscan enemies. This puts an emphasis on two core strategies—corner peeking and crouching—in order to kill enemies before they hit you. It's unlike Doom where you can fight in open arenas dodging projectiles. At hard and above difficulties, this can be a bit unforgiving in that enemies can hit you faster than you can react, even if you know they're already there. So it's somewhat RNG and forces you to savescum. This wasn't really an issue in Blood for example outside of the first Chapter.\n\nThe weapon arsenal is excellent in this game. The core trio available since the start of the game are the pistol, shotgun, and SMG. These three all work very well, with pistol at long range and headshot sniping (especially with its McCree-like high noon attack), shotgun for close quarters (with its alt-fire grenade launcher for AOE), and SMG for AOE spray. It's possibly my favorite pistol in a retro FPS game. Then there are the situational weapons: grenade that actively seeks out enemies, ion bow as a true long-range DPS weapon, chaingun for highest endgame DPS, and proximity mine.\n\nControls are typical for Build Engine games. Instead of a list of items to scroll through, there are just two with specific keybinds: medkit and radar.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The idea of a 2019 game on the Build Engine is interesting. Surprisingly, a lot of the graphic detail, voice dialogue, and scale of the maps still work quite well. It looks and feels a lot like a game from the 90s, and it's more the refinements to the gameplay and level design where you feel the modern change.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ Unlike the Build Engine games of old. Ion Fury has locational damage (headshots), where your pistol can kill cultists with 1 well-placed shot to the head.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ Managing the hassle of the Horadric cube for extra inventory space.\n+ You can recover the sockets of a weapon but you lose the runes/gems.\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ N/A\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nI was motivated to play as it's one of the more popular games in the boomer shooter/retro FPS resurgence. I played on Hard difficulty, my favored choice for this genre. I kept the keybindings the same and added Mouse4 to Ion Bow, Mouse5 to Disperser Grenade, and Q to Medkit so that I only need to use weapon keybinds 1-6. I got bored of the hitscan at E4M2.",

    "comments": "\n\n__Gameplay.__ Amid Evil's unique weapon arsenal is perhaps its greatest appeal. A dual homing missile projectile; a workhorse sweeping projectile sword; overkill-AoE hitscan; rocket launcher; fractal shotgun with a shoot delay and momentarily stops enemy; and BFG. Gone are the prototypical shotgun or assault rifle. The most similar shotgun equivalent is too single-target DPS focused for most encounters. This not like Heretic where the weapons are effectively Doom reskins. This means less reliance on hitscan, high rates of fire, and close-up one-shot-kills. Enemies can block projectiles and you cancel enemy projectiles with yours. At high difficulties, all enemies take more than a single shot to die making it feel hectic but slightly spongier than your typical Dooming like Dusk.\n\nI have mixed feelins about the platforming-style level design. It's cool that it's somewhat unique. Though it's an annoyance doing combat during the such as on narrow ledges. It goes way beyond Doom Eternal's which has fairly casual platforming, and never during the thick of battle.\n\nUnfortunately, I found the enemy variety fairly hit or miss in actually encouraging diverse weapon usage. The only real mechanism was limited ammo, but weapons share ammo so you don't need to use the full variety.\n\nAlso gone are power pickups in select locations, but rather Soul Mode that acts like an \"ultimate\" cooldown meter.\n\nLike Dusk, core controls are minimal and excellent, with movement speed making you feel like a god but with enemies able to move just as fast.\n\nLevel design is surprisingly intuitive, and I like how involved the levels are in opening areas with verticality. It's not just an endless tream of corridors.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Environments are colorful, arcane, and well-drawn as medieval temples. The enemies are fantastical. Surprisingly, the music is pretty forgettable. The game doesn't ooze atmosphere like Dusk or attain the high octane adrenaline that is its gameplay or Doom games.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ N/A\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ N/A\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Drop down is a separate key than Interact (E).\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\nThis entry does not include the DLC. I loved Dusk and Ultrakill, and Amid Evil reigns among the top of classic FPS/boomer shooter games in the recent resurgence. I played on Evil (highest) difficulty as although I'm a fan of Ultra Violence-style gameplay, Hard didn't seem very difficult in early game so I may as well ramp it up further. I tried to explore all areas and collect loot, but I didn't go out of my way in maximizing this. I'm particularly gimped without a map or focus.\n\nI stopped playing after E3M3. I couldn't get into the projectile combat although I like the game's overall design.",

I stopped playing during the middle of Area 2.\n\n__Story.__ Luigi's Mansion has a unique premise over the damsel in distress typical in Super Mario games. It's about being tricked by winning a contest Luigi never entered, Mario being trapped (so still technically damsel in distress), and Luigi aiming to save him.\n\n__Gameplay.__ Core gameplay loop is quite fun: explore a new room, encounter a ghost, then stun the ghost followed by sucking it in. There are plenty enemy types and light puzzle solving encouraging exploration that keeps the variety interesting. The controls are easily Luigi's Mansion's worst part. It's frustrating trying to aim the flashlight and suction at a ghost within the limited time frame of stunning followed by sucking them in. The aiming is just way too clunky, compounded with the default of an inverted y-axis. You often just have to the rely on the auto-aim to hopefully work. It would be better if they removed vertical aiming altogether, simplifying a dimension, on relying instead on autoaim.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ Love the cartoon styles: ages well even playing it in 2020. The orchestral soundtrack with a gothic theme is awesome. I also love the details like Luigi humming to the beat of the songs.\n\n__Details I like:__\n\n+ You can exploit going to Chauncey's room for a 50 HP refill, then going 3-4 rooms away for it to respawn.\n\n__Details I'm ambivalent about:__\n\n+ N/A\n\n__Details I don't like:__\n\n+ Camera angles default to inverted y-axis and you can't change it.

Unfortunately, the game is god awful to play because of its overly complicated controls.\n\n__Story.__ I like the premise of a hacker and a rogue AI. Lore is scattered through data logs and audio logs.\n\n__Gameplay.__ System Shock plays like an exploratory adventure with action/FPS elements.\n\nThe ability to control this much loot, pick up corpses, reload, and more is clear innovation. But the general use of the free cursor movement is a mess from environment interaction to inventory managemen to savingt. There are two control schemes: free cursor movement for inventory management and picking up items; and FPS. For example, how to throw a grenade by toggling modes to select the item from the inventory then dragging it to the main screen; reloading; or navigating the multiple inventories. The range of movement abilities such as walking, running; stand, crouch, prone; and jump are nice but unnecessary.\n\nEnemies have hitscan. Death penalty is reloading at select chambers.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The 3D-esque pixel art are astounding, especially compared to games in this era like Doom (1993) and Doom 2 (1994), and that does age well. Voice acting is also decent and novel.\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ I like the Online Help HUD that points out all the interactable things.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ N/A\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Defaults keybindings.

I played at normal difficulty. 20 minutes into the game I found the controls way too tedious. So I just decided to watch a playthrough instead by the developers (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LDiTZ89j-Q). The first 30 minutes are incredibly scuffed however in the audio setup. The commentary is all about crediting too, which just detracts from the gameplay experience itself. So I watched a no commentary version (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJK5nt4rIRc).",

The game otherwise follows modern shooters with Sprint, Crouch, Prone, regenerative health, some light stealth, standard weapons. The stealth in this game is awful, acting as an alert two system of two permanent stages (normal -> alarm) with few things inbetween in terms of warning. You also can't pick up corpses to hide them, and it's never clear when hiding in bushes or behind cover is sufficient. There is no stealth melee attack either until you turn on Maximum Strength. Enemy AI is also bad with its pathing, detection system, infinite ammo, and some enemies acting as bullet sponges.\n\n__Aesthetics & Sound.__ The level of detail is astounding, particularly faces.

I'll go super nostalgic and enjoy The Burning Crusade again---which was my first experience but on WoWCrack, which had zero scripts and 15x leveling rate.\n\n__On Class and Faction to Play.__\n\nI decided to play a Human Female (primarily Fire/Frost) Mage. This would be my choice for WoW Clasic, with the main contenders being Human Female Rogue and Human Female (primarily Fury DPS, sometimes Protection for Dungeon tanking and Raid offtanking) Warrior.I wanted to play Alliance, Female, and Mage to experience new aspects as I played rogue and tank warrior before (although I didn't study to play a tank warrior very well).\n\n__Leveling.__ I go to zones by zone level, then each hub within the zone, and pick up all quests. I follow Quest Helper for quest pathing. I follow WoW wiki's quest pages to see if I missed a hub's set of quests (e.g., https://wow.gamepedia.com/Elwynn_Forest_quests) and Wowhead if I get stuck.\n\n__Addons.__ I play minimally so as to experience the game authentically and only with quality of life improvements. Below are in order I found them obligatory:\n\n+ Change interface/keybindings for larger camera view, strafe left/right, no backpedal, toggle autorun, numbers in player/enemy frames.\n+ Map with quest solutions (Cartographer, Quest Helper).\n+ Cast bar with seconds.\n+ Advanced stuff for later: Cooldown counter (OmniCC), Damage, Healing, and Threat Meters (Recount), Auction house (Auctioneer), Chat, DeadlyBossMods, and more.\n+ Combat text (Mike Scrolling Combat Text).\n+ Auto-sell greys and repair.\n+ Equip compare.",

First, the art direction, animation, and sound is changed to be a lot more colorful and generically dynamic. Second, Abe's character background no longer has the ton eof a possibly-delusional messiah, and is now made canon in the intro as being revived and enhanced by a shaman (it was previously unclear what this was his hallucination; that uncertainty is important).\n\n__Art/Visuals/Sound.__ I greatly prefer the original's art direction: modern, grungy, alien in both colors and sound design. Here, palettes are colorful and sketchings almost cartoony. The new version overall is a lot more colorful and clean, feeling like any other modern game. The architecture is more now than the futuristic one set up, feeling closer to a comic like Ratchet and Clank's. Even checkpoints are more clearly established and feel video-gamey. Sound is botched: the signature chanting noise is dulled; the Scarab's roar is now a generic lion roar and no longer alien. The original atmosphere just isn't there.\n\nDetails I'm ambivalent about:\n\n+ The original version was primarily 2D. This is a 3D platformer.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ Levels have a moving camera closer to modern day platformers. I much prefer the original of dividing levels into a set of still screens. This adds an artistic feeling to it with a sense of tweaking/refinement at each still such as shadows and detail, and it paces the game as a sequence of puzzles. In contrast, the dynamic camera requires more filters and continuity.\n+ Movement is analog instead of using shoulder buttons. This makes precise movement more difficult, which is required at times for the platforming (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4x8YK9dnj8).\n+ I greatly prefer keeping the quirky mechanics from the original game as they're memorable and iconic in the game: unforgiving deaths, quick save, fewer checkpoints.\n+ The new game has multiple difficulty modes. I greatly prefer the original version's single difficulty and an unforgiving one at that.\n+ Why give health display to triangle? The control scheme is so finicky here.\n+ The new ending credits are so... loud.\n\n## Resources and Miscellanea\n\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/oddworld/comments/915sgp/oddworld_abes_oddysee_vs_oddworld_new_n_tasty/\n+ comparison video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOKyGVwoUJA, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkhDrngAQZ0, https://www.reddit.com/r/oddworld/comments/75e4w2/opinions_on_new_n_tasty_and_fears_for_soulstorm/dq0lukn/. Found the note about extragavant uses of bloom at 4:50 very interesting and well-said. Also true of the pre-rendered artisty of the original compared to the newer game's rendering using generic algorithms/filters for textures and lighting.\n\nI'm motivated to re-get into Oddworld as I have fond memories of playing the first two games and greatly enjoying them. I'll start with the original, and then go on to the sequels.",

It's unfortunate it blew past Kingdom Heart's initial promise to mix FF and Disney; now there's just Disney and a bunch of Kingdom Hearts-specific lore of angsty teenagers.

Unfortunately, it still relies on a slow-crawling leveling stage with story, rotations for combat (one which is even more complicated than WoW's), and an even slower GCD of up to 2 sec compared to WoW's already dreadful 1 sec. The aesthetics are very Asian (specifically Korean) MMORPG-like, with anime-based looks and a traditional job and crafting system. The UI is way too dense. There are no innovations here. (Note main contenders as of 2019 are World of Warcraft, Elder Scrolls Online, Black Desert Online, and Final Fantasy XIV.)",

Like Elder Scrolls, it has a combat system based on timing and blocking. There is no rated pvp or as good raid progression system as WoW.\n\nIn choosing a class, I narrowed it down to Sorcerer and Nightblade. I went with Sorcerer to spice things up given I almost always play the Rogue class (the only exception is really Diablo, where I mained a Sorceress and Amazon). The melee combat in ESO doesn't seem as intensive as, e.g., Black Desert Online. So I don't think I'm missing much by going for ranged DPS.\n\nVisually, the colors are drab. With everything taking a brown hue, all the architecture and world lacks vibrance.\n\nI played up until level 4 and just got bored. The MMO elements are not that interesting, at least for leveling. And the RPG elements seem better in a single player. Like, e.g., WoW, it's a chain of quests to level, with a main storyline, and options for dungeons and PvP. If I were interested in a western RPG, I would be better off playing, e.g., Skyrim, Witcher, or Fallout.\n\nThe daily rewards for logging in, and have a subscription which gives you monthly rewards, all feel.. desperate.\n\nResources\n+ community | r/elderscrollsonline\n+ wiki | https://elderscrollsonline.wiki.fextralife.com/\n+ builds | https://alcasthq.com/",

The graphics are subpar (the aesthetic to me isn't very interesting), and I find the Homestuck-esque humor off-kilter and off-putting. The battle system and the story just isn't very good either. I appreciate the earnest attempt to push the RPG genre, but it's so uninspired in its way of doing so. It also really isn't an RPG. There's a leveling system that doesn't actually work (it's there to poke fun at leveling); the bullet hell is just so boring; and the western RPG choices of pacificist or genocide are not interesting.\n\nListening to the community is tiring as well, with the same shared interests as Homestuck, Deviant Art, Tumblr, Rick and Morty, Adventure Time, Venture Brothers. It's amusing to hear well-constructed criticisms followed by them saying it's your opinion, and that they do like it.",
