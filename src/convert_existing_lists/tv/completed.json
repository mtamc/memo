  {"title":"The Witcher: Season 2","score":"5","date_started":"12/18/21","date_finished":"12/30/21","year":"TBA","staff":"Netflix","comments":"Season 2 is where the Netflix adaptation truly goes off the rails in fanfiction territory, looking barely like any of its source material. Most of the story's main thread deviates significantly from the novels for little reason: new monsters from a broken monolith in Cintra, fainewedd to create new Witchers (and thus the possibility for Ciri to become a true Witcher), Yennefer saving Jaskier as she loses her powers, keeping that Yennefer second love around. They even butchered Yennefer and Ciri's relationship, with Yennefer meeting Ciri for selfish rather than maternal reasons.\n\nIt's clear that the writers made up new elements to make up for the lack of action in Blood Elves, but it's the departures that constitute Witcher Season 2's writing weaknesses. In Season 2, no character is likeable beside Geralt, Ciri, and Jaskier. They made one-dimensional characters out of the amazing supporting cast (Witchers, kingdom rulers, mages) and they ruined existing strong characters like Yennefer. There's also little sense of worldbuilding to understand the state of kingdoms, their culture, even that their exist other Witcher clans, or how different races like elves are aside from the fact they happen to have pointy ears. All the subplots are riddled with plot holes and weird contrivances: the finale is a good example with Ciri's posession being eyerollingly dumb.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ The writing has no sense of space and time. People travel to locations that are weeks or months away within the same episode. From Kaer Morhen to Nenneke's to Cintra back to Kaer Morhen all in episodes 7-8? Why?\n+ Ciri at many points walks around with a cake full of makeup. She's supposed to represent a female badass, not unlike how Arya was portrayed.\n+ Instead of building on the Witcher's already existing and wonderful set of monsters, each complete with deep lore, this adaptation decides to create new monsters!\n+ Eskel in S02E02. He's not rash-headed nor would he die so easily to a Lesh! They did the man dirty. What a bad episode in any case: forced violence for the sake of action, and a portrayal of no one else in Kaer Morhen as particularly competent outside of Geralt and to a lesser extent Vesemir. Do the supporting character Witchers ever do anything useful here like Lambert being a lovable asshole? And they happened to find an orgy of women and somehow brought them to Kaer Morhen, which is literally designed to be nowhere?\n+ S02E03's axe execution is such a contrived plot point. Even the idea that people would entertain the notion of still supporting Artorius and Stregebor after their repeated failures in predicting Nilfgaard's invasion to the North, Cintra, and Sodden, is dumb. The novels are far from perfect, but it's clear every time the TV adaptation steers away from the novel, it does it for the worse.\n+ S02E06. Rien barges into Kaer Morhen (how'd he know?), then beats Vesemir, then leaves (why'd he come in the first place, how did he know to get the specific vial, and why does he even care about a Witcher conversion potion?). Why portray Vesemir as so worthless, and with all the other witchers as incompetent?\n+ S02E07. Dandelion's weirdly buff for a sissy bard..\n+ Vilgefortz with Tissaia? Why? And the romance between Francesca and Filavandrel and their baby only for it to be assassinated.\n+ This witch subplot is entirely unnecessary.\n+ Ciri can continue to cast spells without any training.\n+ Characters that receive unnecessary spotlight: Fringilla, Cahir, the Witch, Francesca, Filavandrel. Characters that received too little spotlight: Vesemir, Lambert, Coen, Eskel, Eskel, Nenneke, Vilgefortz, Vizimir (and Redania as a whole)."},

The show reminds me a lot of Kaiji in this way, where especially the main character keeps succumbing to his vices. Other elements of the show can be weak, such as the games not always being very interesting, and certain characters being fairly boring without a growth. For example, having gambling vices is an interesting character development as they must struggle with them. Having a brother in a shelter, your father shot while trying to escape North Korea, and the mother captured and moved back to North Korea, is just abject depression for the sake of it. That only describes the character's environment and says little about the character."},

Some examples:\n\n+ The forced story with Darnell and Wyatt. Because she just so happened to be around when he was asking for bail, and further that they bond.\n+ The romance between Ruth and Uncle Ben. It's just more contrived ways to introduce more relationship dynamics among the existing cast. It doesn't push a particular story agenda behind Ruth or Ben at all.\n+ Getting Zeke back by starting a public confrontation. Why on earth would she even start this and not employ someone else to do it? There are so many more roundabout ways about getting Zeke back without.\n+ The way the previous casino owners just fight, and are so easily convinced to be one side or the other. Hell, the husband just so happens to have accidentally killed the wife too! Talk about dramatic.\n+ The highly melodramatic character drama that makes a marital conflict lead to splashly cartel conflicts. Like Navarro beating up a tied Marty as he asks vague questions like what he wants.\n+ The highly dramatic unfreezing of the Panama account while he's in cell.\n\nI hate Wendy this season. She's always seen herself as far more important than she is. It's hilarious that she thinks as a housewife that she can stay toe to toe with the cartel.\n+ All the souped up reasoning for Ruth to ultimately leave her relationship with Marty and Wendy. Somehow she has only beef with Wendy but none for Helen Pierce? And she doesn't see her responsibility in this matter?\n\nI like the mental health depiction by Ben, who's a great actor. His violent episodes are often a little too melodramatic, but it works well. His acting stands out most in the season."},

The overall narrative focus on one of the more interesting side characters, alongside a jedi dynamic as a baby, works qute well. I'm also pleasantly surprised by the production value.\n\nI'm particularly surprised at how well the Mandalorian can express nuance and personality given that he wears a helmet all day, blocking any ability to express through his face.\n\nThe Mandalorian is like a video game, and I love it. I love the detail in the Mandalorian's armor. Across the fights, his armor is actuallly destructible. Also feels somewhat like an RPG in his upgrading of armor, first a pauldron and later a full armor set with weapon unlocks. Heck, there's even the equivalent of a quest hub.\n\nSome episodes are a little too weak unfortunately: S1E4's battle montage to save villagers Seven Samurai-style; S1E5's dumb betrayal by the rookie mercenary; S1E6's shallow motley crew all of which fight against Mando hitting every heist movie cliche; S1E8's roller coaster of people saving people."},

The whodunnit takes its time but builds it well to keep it entertaining given all the characters, their dynamic, and the setting building. The comedy such as the door is hilarious.

  {"title":"The Terror: Season 2","score":"6","date_started":"12/2/20","date_finished":"12/5/20","year":"","staff":"","comments":"The Terror seems to have two core elements that add tension and horror: the setting they're in (stranded in the Arctic or internment camp) and the supernatural. Season 2's setting and supernatural are generally just less suspenseful than Season 1. The primary characters don't stand out as well as Season 1's either.\n\nAs a side note, I like the diversity of its cast. It's exceptionally rare to see an American production of an Asian cast.\n\nThe overall script seems lacking unfortunately. Plot points progress with only tangible connections. And plot threads just become suddenly forgotten about. Chester just turnsabout and goes to translate for a war splitting the setting based on a tangential plot point that it was following only him. The doctor is murdered. This makes the characters not as strong. For example, the dad is hardened by his imprisonment and is clearly Anti-American. But after a while, it literally dissipates and you forget what makes him him; now loving of Chester. They're just burning a shed while at an internment camp, and no one's raising a concern?  Major Bowen's plot armor. After a while, the body possession is B-rated acting. The aunt being a curandero dealing with magic of the dead. The twin brother plot twist. There's no logic to the villain: it's boring if arbitrarily in the plot, the villain is can just show up anywhere at anytime. There's more horror if there are rules set in the world that make them less godly. Yet another pregnancy.\n\nI thought the portrayal of the Yurei after her suicide in a purgatory-like state followed by her obstinance toward resurrection transitioned so well.\n\nThe ending scene with the shotgun is badass. Exorcism old-school style. They should have done this and fought against her like it episodes ago. Too bad it was short-lived. Having the dad die in lieu of the son seemed unnecessary."},

It adds fantasy well as a way to add interest to the sea politics, which can get old by itself. The characters are all strong. Francis transitioning from the underdog verteran with the correct caution by shot down by vanity and royal Englishmen inexperience, later into alcoholism. James Fitzpatrick. Goodsir. Blanky. Jopson. The punishments and brutality is severe: eaten alive, lashes, limbs cut off, dehydration and lead poisoning, the brutal winter, a man's face pulled apart from chains (Edward).\n\nI'm a little infuriated with how Hinkey is the personification of all gone chaotic from the bottom-up ranks. He's a conman that stole the identity of the original Hinkey to enter the crew. Then he kidnapped Lady Silence and got the lashings. THen he tries to incite a rebellion. Then he happens to be among the three that find Eskimo who he kills the other two. With the creature gone, it seems like Hinkey serves as the extra drama on top of the already desolate situation they're in. He plays a single note like a King Joffrey from Game of Thrones, and that's what makes him so disappointing.\n\nI have mixed thoughts about Franics being the literal only survivor. I think it would have served even more to its bleak atmosphere if at the end everyone died. I suppose Francis dying and telling their later rescues that he died is symbolic enough of full crew death. The last shot in particular is great at capturing his feeling there: sorrow but also acceptance.\n\nCompletely agree that The Terror took a different direction than its more horrific first episodes, focusing instead on mutiny rather than more abstract horrors from insanity. https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTerror/comments/8dr7l8/theres_traces_of_a_better_horror_series_in_the."},

They all have their own quirks that define them: Susie Myerson's bluntness, Imogene's peculiar obsessions, Sophie Lennon, the haughty Jewish mom, the maid Zelda, Joel's girlfriend Mei, and certainly Midge.\n\nLove the takes on period things: light sexism; black folks not allowed in the same hotel; Jewish circumsion ceremony.\n\nThis season has a few too many subplots added on top of the already existing ones unfortunately. It clearly has continued in the direction of a sitcom rather than a single focused narrative. Subplots include Lenny Bruce; the dad; Sophia Lennon; Imoegene and Archie. And yet another one in episodes 7 and later 8 with Suzy's gambling addition, then the mom's matchmaking subplot, then the re-raised Benjamin drama(??). [It suffers slightly for it](https://jamesjguild.com/blog/2020/6/16/why-season-3-of-marvelous-mrs-maisel-was-so-disappointing). I'm also not sure about the ending: given their bonding (remember only Midge knows Shy's first name), the abrupt cutoff felt a little too forced in order to keep the Mrs. Maisel up-and-coming still promising, and not immediately successful. [It also allows for a change of pace in her next steps, Season 4 wouldn't just be the Season 3's tour again](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMarvelousMrsMaisel/comments/e6r9wv/episode_discussion_s03e08_a_jewish_girl_walks/fa10o5h/).\n\nActing is still excellent for all these characters to stand out though."},

The relationship-building is especially strong across all her interactions. She shows a common pattern of alienation, having certain people have a long-lasting impact on her but she ultiamtely has trouble maintaining relationships, relying on herself. She also makes a huge impact on others while not allowing them in to affect her. I also like the details like her not caring for any travel attractions and focusing entirely on chess booked up in her hotel room: I've experienced that all too much.\n\nThe romanticism with the sexiness of Anya Taylor-Joy is both enticing in keeping me to watch but also a little distracting. I guess we just suspend our disbelief here that geniuses can also be good-looking, well-dressed, and have an active sexual life. These things are often repressed (intentionally or not) as all brainpower and time is maximized to the pursuit of their craft. I should know. One example that makes this weirdly take shape is the pattern of having her trainer be of similar age and where there's a romantic interest. It's like anime reverse harem.\n\nEnding is too sappy for me. I'm a fan of realism: isolation, depression, and growth."},

Love the two characters, albeit a bit too stock in tropes. The subject is of course fascinating in its own right. A bit of cinematic flair.\n\nSpecific moments:\n\n+ The ending shot of S01E04. Slightly below, angled upwards with a direct shot at all three. All with slight smirks as they're on the elevator. No dialogue, just the closing music.\n\nInspired to watch this almost entirely because of Bong Joon Ho's praise and its connection to Memories of Murder (https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/bong-joon-ho-mindhunter-david-fincher-1202180531/).\n\n\"I think this is one of the shows greatest attributes, it explains a pattern seen in murderers and then later you spot it in a situation, often with Holden.

The action scenes are particularly great. I love the grit in the show. In episode 2 for example, when a halfling is implicitly ordered to give his boots to Ciri. The soundtrack is also on target.\n\nBut the adaptation is not great. The core weakness is a streamlining of the narrative in a way that reduces what defines the Witcher series: moral ambiguity; strong characters; and a slavic lived-in world. You can see this even from the premiere episode: the lesser evil story with Renfri was not given enough context to show why Geralt necessarily even went back to Blaviken in the first place. Not enough context was built on the excellent idea in the short story that both have reasonable motivations, and it's unclear who's really telling the truth. The lore is so streamlined at times it's hilariously cliche. Similarly, the timeline across the different perspectives is not clear at all. And the cinematography and budget is all over the place: sylvan in episode 2 looks stupid (how do they do that with $80 million?). It's not clear why or how Geralt fell in love with Yennefer: way too streamlined. The storylines with Ciri and Yennefer are both just bad: almost all of their scenes could have been omitted and the story would have proceeded fine. Worldbuilding from bestiary to the setting is not great.\n\nHenry Cavill, Dandelion, Yennefer, and Calanthe are all the only good actors.\n\n\"First of all, they present Yennefer completely the wrong way around. In the books she is introduced as distant, cold, beautiful and enigmatic. We only see here softer side in glimpses as the story progresses and her and Geralt dance around and each other. In the show she is presented as this insecure misfigured girl and remains emotional and unstable once she matures. For me, it really takes away the complexity of her personality that she has in the books, she is very unlayered in the show. For example, the moment when she goes to istredd is completely reversed from the books, where she is chased away because of Geralts dream of having a sedentary life together and toys with both Geralt and Istred.\" I agree with this. (https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/edqjtf/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_netflix_witcher_is/)\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ The potion tradition and two swords are on point.\n+ I like that in the overall series, separate from the games, Geralt is more brooding and poor from the lack of contracts; and the focus on destiny among the three.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ The diversity cast is strange. I prefer Ciri's appearance in Witcher 3 than a Danish/Swedish woman. Half-Indian Yennefer is weird. Same goes for a black Fringilla. Indian and mediocre-looking Triss.\n+ No humming of the medallion.\n+ Killing Mousesack/Ermion, and replacing him with a psychotic doppler, is so stupid.\n+ The all-powerful sorceress Yennefer do shit little fighting with a sword in episode 6 and casting portals in episode 4.\n+ Yennefer as a character in the show makes no sense. \" You wanted to be beautiful and powerful so you gave up fertility, you killed Anica, you betrayed Aretruza because you weren’t happy with what you got and now she is acting all bitchy because she got fooled to go to Aretruza.\" https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/ed6wtj/episode_discussion_s01e07_before_a_fall/?sort=top\n+ No witcher detective mode forensics scenes.\n+ A severe lack of emphasis on monster killing, from setup to learning about the monster and setting to execution.\n+ What the fuck. Why did Geralt even fight the drowners/ghouls in the episode 8?\n+ Vilgefortz does a team kill at episode 8 for no reason, as if that's the only way for the writers to show that Vilgefortz is evil. And the fight scene where all he does is conjure swords is hilarious.\n+ Fringilla is commically super villain.\n\nI sort of wish this show went the route of medieval Supernatural/CSI/Mushishi. That would be less ambitiously dumb as a Game of Thrones ruler civil war grandiosity.\n\n\"Sapkowski was very often criticised for using modern language in his books, to which he replies: this is not medieval times, it's never-never-land and, besides, they do not speak Polish, he's just translating.\" Interesting. https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/ed6wmz/episode_discussion_s01e02_four_marks/fbga66a/"},

Keeps the dialogue alive even given his trite position as a person hoping to follow footsteps of his family even with their excommunicated, damaged legacy.\n\nIn July 2021, I ended up rewatching the whole season and not recognizing that I had already watched the season! It did feel vaguely familiar.. It certainly is more enjoyable this time around as I played a Castlevania game and can appreciate it more."},

Archtypical side characters. But I think what this show most stands out in is its accuracy at all the casual minor events, e.g., noticing someone's 'mirror face'; playing off the actor's own dynamics. The clueless dumb guy, the totally weird Hangover-type eccentric, the pot smoker. Bertie, Micky, and Gus are very stylized to suit the actors, which is great. Metrosexual pushover Gus plays to his strength."},
  {"title":"Westworld Season 1","score":"6","date_started":"02/04/18","date_finished":"02/06/18","year":"2016","staff":"HBO","comments":"I like the two-bit nature that the story forces the actors to play. I also like the meta-nature of certain conversations when detailing the actors when the newcomers do random stuff (especially when that one old man comes into the fray).\n\nThe premise is something very fun. I can really enjoy it like a American-directed version of an MMO, with quests, guests randomly pillaging and raping, various pyrotechnic effects and invincibility. The repeated events add a nice rhythm to it, like a deja vu movie, that you can really start to jive to and appreciate the details on each iteration.\n\nIn terms of themes, I thought it raised some interesting questions in AI that haven't been really mainstreamed before. For example, the literal creation of worlds (far beyond what other works of fiction have done with VR). The controllable layers of AI could be explored in more depth but I thought it raised interesting points, e.g., scripted dialogue to improvisation to self-interest, levels of emotional feeling for conveying lines, affectation. I also liked how the varieties of narratives: some are committee-chosen and market-tested (like the Hector event of blasting through the town); others get increasingly crazier as you delve outside the town like Pariah, the city of thieves and sex.\n\nBernard as a host was a little ridiculous. It was like the level of soap dramas in the reveal. I do like the overall idea, that there's a programmer who knows how to code hosts and is one himself. He's in a unique position that would be tantamount to humans knowing how to program the human genome. The other reveals are a little much too---like Dolores being Wyatt, William and Dolores actually occurring at a different time length; William as the old man; Ford as the villain followed by Ford as the hero in the end."},

And what an ending. Truly a combination of horror and supernatural.\n\nThe conversation hilarity between Cary and Oliver in episode 7. And then the dynamic between Cary and Sydney. Really makes up for the stalest episode of the season: the sixth.\n\nIt can get mainstream and boring unfortunately at times---episode 6 stalled the story. it also could have ended at episode 7."},

I'm not even that interested in politics because of the smarminess of it all. But the way they bounce off each other is very natural, very ingenious. Barack's answers seemed prepared but not politically prepared. It was fascinating to hear how he thinks. And his frame of references: Senator Moynihan from 1920s in New York, an experiment of three Egyptians in Tahrir Square. I love how little of it focused on specific political decisions. But rather, the banter between the two and a collection of anecdotes that paint a picture of who Barack Obama is."},

Always surprised how much they're able to capture in a given episode, even if some stories are made up. Nature is amazing. Some of it can be rather superficial to keep with mainstream---sometimes wish it went deeper. I like episodes end with an actionable note, that current ways we affect nature matter and are affecting the ecosystems we analyze. Scenes range very much from majestic to adrenaline-filled to comedic. The cities episode was especially interesting: Bowerbirds decorate their houses with garbage, steal everything that isn't nailed down and masquerade as women. So they're no different to any other Aussie bloke; jaguar snatching a piglet in India; monkeys stealing food from a grocery market; two gangs of 60 spotted hyenas battling over territory; wells catfish eating pidgeons; the Chinese sequence of going through streets and zooming in/out; hatchling turtles not adapting; and the productive notes like trees in Milan or integrated ecosystem in Singapore."},

I love it all. This is easily the most healing genre of live-action series I've seen.\n\nThere's a part that irks me sometimes about its unabashed happiness. For example, he has this nostalgic feeling about the sea in one episode and one shot shows a bunch of fish hauled off in a ship; this reminds me just how culturally these depend on. If those fish were human bodies, it would be horrifying. In another episode with pasta, he wishes he could go against the social formality of the restaurant and just slurp down pasta with his chopsticks, and drink beer instead of wine. While I admire that he should do what he wants, I think it conflates the formality angle of just enjoying food to the best with the customs set down to actually enjoy it. For example, I think if the goal were really to maximize food enjoyment, you might learn something by taking the Italian approach of wine, forks, and biting down instead of slurping. This isn't something I hold against the series—if anything, I respect them more for making this transparent as part of one's lifestyle."},
  {"title":"Stranger Things 2","score":"5","date_started":"11/19/17","date_finished":"11/23/17","year":"2017","staff":"Netflix","comments":"Interesting split of characters in a Game of Thrones style: Eleven sometimes with Hopper; Nancy and Johnathon; Mike, Will, mother, and Bob; Dustin, Steve, Lucas, Max. Not as interesting as the first season with the more horror feeling, world-building, and inside-out world as well. This is sort of banal and falling onto the same flavors: Will is still a victim; Winona Ryder plays the concerned mother. Eleven is literally seen crying like every episode still playing the victim. Stranger Things 2 overall is just not as well-defined.\n\nThe drama between Nancy and X is trite. Kind of unfortunate Mike has less of a role this season. Everyone in general is less focused on and more spread-out. An eyes-rolling banality of a douche racist older brother. I also liked the few episodes where Dustin raises the demogorgon. Super power revenge is a little stupid. Jump scares and music not as interesting this season.\n\nI do like the new girl. The only interesting dynamic is Steve and Dustin, and Hopper and Eleven. And that new director has morals.\n\nCallback references like the Eggo waffles is totally not subtle. It's more eye-rolling. These are all one-bit, as if they define the character. Will's music mixtape. Steve's bat."},
  {"title":"Stranger Things","score":"7","date_started":"11/18/17","date_finished":"11/19/17","year":"2016","staff":"Netflix","comments":"Interesting intersection of narratives with three main stories starting around the middle: the kids entering sci-fi and coming of age escaping the government; the teens with their love triangle and kill-the-moster; the adults with their save Will and conspiracy.\n\nThe vibe is fun and oldies references. The geeky humor and kids with sci-fi and a coming of age. I can see why people like the series, probably for this part. I especially love the intro and Twin Peaks like cut transitioning into the start of each episode.\n\nInvestigative drama is played out well in a sort of Twin peaks old town vibe way but aay less cozy and less surreal. What I love about the mystery of the alluding to all the various possibilities. It may not arrive at them and most likely the real solution is quite simple and not that interesting, but leaving up these questions all these possibilities is what makes it so inviting. Similar to the Prisoner and other otpf those like films with Jake Gylenhaal in that directors movies.\n\nThe high school group drama is a little boring. Very Sixteen Candles or like any other John Hughes film. Thw whole fight scene and then cups coming up for some tpstupid tpdrama. Totally infuriating. Kill the monster vibe attached to this doesn't really help cut it.\n\nAs for as characters, the Will family is really good. Kids too, although occasionally one sided with Dustin as the playful comic, and black kid as getting on everyones nerves, and Mike as the straight edge.\n\nSome of the dialogue and pacing can feel rushed and synthetic, to move plot points during the end.\n\nThe whole conspiracy government angle is a little wacky. Totally implausible. Especially with how organized they are, from state to fake pseudo educational counselors to technicians and bugging everything. And on the mystery side as if everyone can really understand whats going on. And as if it is just one person with full authority to personify the evil lab. Also just one girl and one monster.\n\nThe angle of the opposite world like the veil of shadows is neat."},

It doesn't cower from displaying him entering whorehouses. It seems like everyone is out to get him. Like an empty vial, his emotions are showed through others around him. Having this shown live action somehow feels a little more sillier than in animation or manga form.\n\nIt's deep in tropes as from the manga with a beta guy and a harem of girls ranging in ages and a boring angsty history of a father murdering a cheating mother and a miserable writing career. I like the faxing machine gimmick where a note appears every so often reminding you that he's a murderer's son and displays more explicitly his angst. But more so, it builds on these tropes with a far more mature presentation behind it. Everyone around him is a pretty interesting and dynamic character playing on their tropes. If only the protagonist did too.\n\nNanaka is best girl (in looks at least).\n\nEnd of episode 7: Oh DAMN!\n\nI really really like that the show actually ending with Shin with one of the girls, and not just the bland open-ended harem ending. And that it was never an obvious shipping, but through the character history it makes the most sense as Hitomi had the most reason to live with him as she read his books and is very knowledgeable about the same things he is."},

Glad to see Bateman doing quality acting with a quality cast. I love how brutally honest and blunt Marty can be. It really drives the story and prevents it from stagnating with cloying drama cliches. I like how they include others into the business rather than in Breaking Bad where Walter is to fend for himself. Some of it can be overly dramatic as Season 1 drags on unfortunately, with no stand out stars aside from Bateman. The undercover agent seducing a gay redneck is a weak subplot, and so is the inert action from the local heroin dealers. Bateman and Ruth are the most dynamic characters of the season. The Snells, the drug carterl, and the cops all need better character-building."},

The year of life makes a strong statement about viewing the person's overall life.\n\nThe death teasing at the start of some episodes (and misc. scenes) is a little irritating. Also occasionally overdramatic and loves to draw more conflicts for the sake of the drama. Not sure how I feel about the same when they do something like a confession, and relapse to reveal that it was all in a person's head daydreaming.\n\nThe story's progression is great, although it's not as spontaneous as it should be: tends to stick to same relationships only because of employability conveniences. It also grows more violent and sexual merely to fit the demographic, often leading to loose and often awkward plot twists (such as the finale explaining how Lisa died)."},
