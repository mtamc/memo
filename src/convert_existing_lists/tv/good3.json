    "review": "Season 2 is where the Netflix adaptation truly goes off the rails in fanfiction territory, looking barely like any of its source material. Most of the story's main thread deviates significantly from the novels for little reason: new monsters from a broken monolith in Cintra, fainewedd to create new Witchers (and thus the possibility for Ciri to become a true Witcher), Yennefer saving Jaskier as she loses her powers, keeping that Yennefer second love around. They even butchered Yennefer and Ciri's relationship, with Yennefer meeting Ciri for selfish rather than maternal reasons.\n\nIt's clear that the writers made up new elements to make up for the lack of action in Blood Elves, but it's the departures that constitute Witcher Season 2's writing weaknesses. In Season 2, no character is likeable beside Geralt, Ciri, and Jaskier. They made one-dimensional characters out of the amazing supporting cast (Witchers, kingdom rulers, mages) and they ruined existing strong characters like Yennefer. There's also little sense of worldbuilding to understand the state of kingdoms, their culture, even that their exist other Witcher clans, or how different races like elves are aside from the fact they happen to have pointy ears. All the subplots are riddled with plot holes and weird contrivances: the finale is a good example with Ciri's posession being eyerollingly dumb.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ The writing has no sense of space and time. People travel to locations that are weeks or months away within the same episode. From Kaer Morhen to Nenneke's to Cintra back to Kaer Morhen all in episodes 7-8? Why?\n+ Ciri at many points walks around with a cake full of makeup. She's supposed to represent a female badass, not unlike how Arya was portrayed.\n+ Instead of building on the Witcher's already existing and wonderful set of monsters, each complete with deep lore, this adaptation decides to create new monsters!\n+ Eskel in S02E02. He's not rash-headed nor would he die so easily to a Lesh! They did the man dirty. What a bad episode in any case: forced violence for the sake of action, and a portrayal of no one else in Kaer Morhen as particularly competent outside of Geralt and to a lesser extent Vesemir. Do the supporting character Witchers ever do anything useful here like Lambert being a lovable asshole? And they happened to find an orgy of women and somehow brought them to Kaer Morhen, which is literally designed to be nowhere?\n+ S02E03's axe execution is such a contrived plot point. Even the idea that people would entertain the notion of still supporting Artorius and Stregebor after their repeated failures in predicting Nilfgaard's invasion to the North, Cintra, and Sodden, is dumb. The novels are far from perfect, but it's clear every time the TV adaptation steers away from the novel, it does it for the worse.\n+ S02E06. Rien barges into Kaer Morhen (how'd he know?), then beats Vesemir, then leaves (why'd he come in the first place, how did he know to get the specific vial, and why does he even care about a Witcher conversion potion?). Why portray Vesemir as so worthless, and with all the other witchers as incompetent?\n+ S02E07. Dandelion's weirdly buff for a sissy bard..\n+ Vilgefortz with Tissaia? Why? And the romance between Francesca and Filavandrel and their baby only for it to be assassinated.\n+ This witch subplot is entirely unnecessary.\n+ Ciri can continue to cast spells without any training.\n+ Characters that receive unnecessary spotlight: Fringilla, Cahir, the Witch, Francesca, Filavandrel. Characters that received too little spotlight: Vesemir, Lambert, Coen, Eskel, Eskel, Nenneke, Vilgefortz, Vizimir (and Redania as a whole).",

Other elements of the show can be weak, such as the games not always being very interesting, and certain characters being fairly boring without a growth. For example, having gambling vices is an interesting character development as they must struggle with them. Having a brother in a shelter, your father shot while trying to escape North Korea, and the mother captured and moved back to North Korea, is just abject depression for the sake of it. That only describes the character's environment and says little about the character.",

    "review": "Man this show has some contrived writing. Some examples:\n\n+ The forced story with Darnell and Wyatt. Because she just so happened to be around when he was asking for bail, and further that they bond.\n+ The romance between Ruth and Uncle Ben. It's just more contrived ways to introduce more relationship dynamics among the existing cast. It doesn't push a particular story agenda behind Ruth or Ben at all.\n+ Getting Zeke back by starting a public confrontation. Why on earth would she even start this and not employ someone else to do it? There are so many more roundabout ways about getting Zeke back without.\n+ The way the previous casino owners just fight, and are so easily convinced to be one side or the other. Hell, the husband just so happens to have accidentally killed the wife too! Talk about dramatic.\n+ The highly melodramatic character drama that makes a marital conflict lead to splashly cartel conflicts. Like Navarro beating up a tied Marty as he asks vague questions like what he wants.\n+ The highly dramatic unfreezing of the Panama account while he's in cell.\n\nI hate Wendy this season. She's always seen herself as far more important than she is. It's hilarious that she thinks as a housewife that she can stay toe to toe with the cartel.\n+ All the souped up reasoning for Ruth to ultimately leave her relationship with Marty and Wendy. Somehow she has only beef with Wendy but none for Helen Pierce? And she doesn't see her responsibility in this matter?\n\nI like the mental health depiction by Ben, who's a great actor. His violent episodes are often a little too melodramatic, but it works well. His acting stands out most in the season.",

    "review": "The gritty detail, diversity of races shown, yet still remaining true to the fantasy archetypes of Star Wars. The overall narrative focus on one of the more interesting side characters, alongside a jedi dynamic as a baby, works qute well. I'm also pleasantly surprised by the production value.\n\nI'm particularly surprised at how well the Mandalorian can express nuance and personality given that he wears a helmet all day, blocking any ability to express through his face.\n\nThe Mandalorian is like a video game, and I love it. I love the detail in the Mandalorian's armor. Across the fights, his armor is actuallly destructible. Also feels somewhat like an RPG in his upgrading of armor, first a pauldron and later a full armor set with weapon unlocks. Heck, there's even the equivalent of a quest hub.\n\nSome episodes are a little too weak unfortunately: S1E4's battle montage to save villagers Seven Samurai-style; S1E5's dumb betrayal by the rookie mercenary; S1E6's shallow motley crew all of which fight against Mando hitting every heist movie cliche; S1E8's roller coaster of people saving people.",

    "review": "The Terror seems to have two core elements that add tension and horror: the setting they're in (stranded in the Arctic or internment camp) and the supernatural. Season 2's setting and supernatural are generally just less suspenseful than Season 1. The primary characters don't stand out as well as Season 1's either.\n\nAs a side note, I like the diversity of its cast. It's exceptionally rare to see an American production of an Asian cast.\n\nThe overall script seems lacking unfortunately. Plot points progress with only tangible connections. And plot threads just become suddenly forgotten about. Chester just turnsabout and goes to translate for a war splitting the setting based on a tangential plot point that it was following only him. The doctor is murdered. This makes the characters not as strong. For example, the dad is hardened by his imprisonment and is clearly Anti-American. But after a while, it literally dissipates and you forget what makes him him; now loving of Chester. They're just burning a shed while at an internment camp, and no one's raising a concern?  Major Bowen's plot armor. After a while, the body possession is B-rated acting. The aunt being a curandero dealing with magic of the dead. The twin brother plot twist. There's no logic to the villain: it's boring if arbitrarily in the plot, the villain is can just show up anywhere at anytime. There's more horror if there are rules set in the world that make them less godly. Yet another pregnancy.\n\nI thought the portrayal of the Yurei after her suicide in a purgatory-like state followed by her obstinance toward resurrection transitioned so well.\n\nThe ending scene with the shotgun is badass. Exorcism old-school style. They should have done this and fought against her like it episodes ago. Too bad it was short-lived. Having the dad die in lieu of the son seemed unnecessary.",

    "review": "The suspense is excellent with its building mystery. It adds fantasy well as a way to add interest to the sea politics, which can get old by itself. The characters are all strong. Francis transitioning from the underdog verteran with the correct caution by shot down by vanity and royal Englishmen inexperience, later into alcoholism. James Fitzpatrick. Goodsir. Blanky. Jopson. The punishments and brutality is severe: eaten alive, lashes, limbs cut off, dehydration and lead poisoning, the brutal winter, a man's face pulled apart from chains (Edward).\n\nI'm a little infuriated with how Hinkey is the personification of all gone chaotic from the bottom-up ranks. He's a conman that stole the identity of the original Hinkey to enter the crew. Then he kidnapped Lady Silence and got the lashings. THen he tries to incite a rebellion. Then he happens to be among the three that find Eskimo who he kills the other two. With the creature gone, it seems like Hinkey serves as the extra drama on top of the already desolate situation they're in. He plays a single note like a King Joffrey from Game of Thrones, and that's what makes him so disappointing.\n\nI have mixed thoughts about Franics being the literal only survivor. I think it would have served even more to its bleak atmosphere if at the end everyone died. I suppose Francis dying and telling their later rescues that he died is symbolic enough of full crew death. The last shot in particular is great at capturing his feeling there: sorrow but also acceptance.\n\nCompletely agree that The Terror took a different direction than its more horrific first episodes, focusing instead on mutiny rather than more abstract horrors from insanity. https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTerror/comments/8dr7l8/theres_traces_of_a_better_horror_series_in_the.",

They all have their own quirks that define them: Susie Myerson's bluntness, Imogene's peculiar obsessions, Sophie Lennon, the haughty Jewish mom, the maid Zelda, Joel's girlfriend Mei, and certainly Midge.\n\nLove the takes on period things: light sexism; black folks not allowed in the same hotel; Jewish circumsion ceremony.\n\nThis season has a few too many subplots added on top of the already existing ones unfortunately. It clearly has continued in the direction of a sitcom rather than a single focused narrative. Subplots include Lenny Bruce; the dad; Sophia Lennon; Imoegene and Archie. And yet another one in episodes 7 and later 8 with Suzy's gambling addition, then the mom's matchmaking subplot, then the re-raised Benjamin drama(??). [It suffers slightly for it](https://jamesjguild.com/blog/2020/6/16/why-season-3-of-marvelous-mrs-maisel-was-so-disappointing). I'm also not sure about the ending: given their bonding (remember only Midge knows Shy's first name), the abrupt cutoff felt a little too forced in order to keep the Mrs. Maisel up-and-coming still promising, and not immediately successful. [It also allows for a change of pace in her next steps, Season 4 wouldn't just be the Season 3's tour again](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMarvelousMrsMaisel/comments/e6r9wv/episode_discussion_s03e08_a_jewish_girl_walks/fa10o5h/).\n\nActing is still excellent for all these characters to stand out though.",

    "review": "Overall story is great with the budding characters and thw two main threads of developing her comedy (with period piece influences such as stand-up charged for indecent exposure) and her marriage. Jokes feel too Jewish for me sometimes.\n\nThe math background for Abe's character is surprisingly accurate. It's introductory linear algebra, but the background with the student questions and even Abe's dream position in moving from a professor at Columbia to Bell Labs as a dream job is so true.\n\nI enjoy the common storytelling formula of the upbringing of a newcomer to a new craft. Aside from the story itself, it provides some insight into the craft which I can better appreciate.",

    "review": "I love the complexities in expanding her background: her growing up, her proclivity for substance abuse, he lacking parentage, the chess sexism, romance. The relationship-building is especially strong across all her interactions. She shows a common pattern of alienation, having certain people have a long-lasting impact on her but she ultiamtely has trouble maintaining relationships, relying on herself. She also makes a huge impact on others while not allowing them in to affect her. I also like the details like her not caring for any travel attractions and focusing entirely on chess booked up in her hotel room: I've experienced that all too much.\n\nThe romanticism with the sexiness of Anya Taylor-Joy is both enticing in keeping me to watch but also a little distracting. I guess we just suspend our disbelief here that geniuses can also be good-looking, well-dressed, and have an active sexual life. These things are often repressed (intentionally or not) as all brainpower and time is maximized to the pursuit of their craft. I should know. One example that makes this weirdly take shape is the pattern of having her trainer be of similar age and where there's a romantic interest. It's like anime reverse harem.\n\nEnding is too sappy for me. I'm a fan of realism: isolation, depression, and growth.",

    "review": "Mindhunter is part documentary, part procedural crime. Love the two characters, albeit a bit too stock in tropes. The subject is of course fascinating in its own right. A bit of cinematic flair.\n\nSpecific moments:\n\n+ The ending shot of S01E04. Slightly below, angled upwards with a direct shot at all three. All with slight smirks as they're on the elevator. No dialogue, just the closing music.\n\nInspired to watch this almost entirely because of Bong Joon Ho's praise and its connection to Memories of Murder (https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/bong-joon-ho-mindhunter-david-fincher-1202180531/).\n\n\"I think this is one of the shows greatest attributes, it explains a pattern seen in murderers and then later you spot it in a situation, often with Holden. For example the character acting, the lack of boundaries, victimisation, Holdens lack of social skills, it's awesome even if it doesn't lead to anything greater plot wise. It makes you notice things, encourages you to take part in the story.\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MindHunter/comments/7635f3/mindhunter_1x08_episode_8_episode_discussion/. Yes!\n\nSeason 2 is more plain and boring. Serial killer Brian as a plot feels forced. The Atlanta serial killer plot drags. And the lesbian plot. I do like the subplot of FBI taking the investigations with significantly more notice.",

    "review": "Some excellent individual scenes that capture the spirit of the show, and that's what I watch this for. The action scenes are particularly great. I love the grit in the show. In episode 2 for example, when a halfling is implicitly ordered to give his boots to Ciri. The soundtrack is also on target.\n\nBut the adaptation is not great. The core weakness is a streamlining of the narrative in a way that reduces what defines the Witcher series: moral ambiguity; strong characters; and a slavic lived-in world. You can see this even from the premiere episode: the lesser evil story with Renfri was not given enough context to show why Geralt necessarily even went back to Blaviken in the first place. Not enough context was built on the excellent idea in the short story that both have reasonable motivations, and it's unclear who's really telling the truth. The lore is so streamlined at times it's hilariously cliche. Similarly, the timeline across the different perspectives is not clear at all. And the cinematography and budget is all over the place: sylvan in episode 2 looks stupid (how do they do that with $80 million?). It's not clear why or how Geralt fell in love with Yennefer: way too streamlined. The storylines with Ciri and Yennefer are both just bad: almost all of their scenes could have been omitted and the story would have proceeded fine. Worldbuilding from bestiary to the setting is not great.\n\nHenry Cavill, Dandelion, Yennefer, and Calanthe are all the only good actors.\n\n\"First of all, they present Yennefer completely the wrong way around. In the books she is introduced as distant, cold, beautiful and enigmatic. We only see here softer side in glimpses as the story progresses and her and Geralt dance around and each other. In the show she is presented as this insecure misfigured girl and remains emotional and unstable once she matures. For me, it really takes away the complexity of her personality that she has in the books, she is very unlayered in the show. For example, the moment when she goes to istredd is completely reversed from the books, where she is chased away because of Geralts dream of having a sedentary life together and toys with both Geralt and Istred.\" I agree with this. (https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/edqjtf/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_netflix_witcher_is/)\n\nDetails I like:\n\n+ The potion tradition and two swords are on point.\n+ I like that in the overall series, separate from the games, Geralt is more brooding and poor from the lack of contracts; and the focus on destiny among the three.\n\nDetails I don't like:\n\n+ The diversity cast is strange. I prefer Ciri's appearance in Witcher 3 than a Danish/Swedish woman. Half-Indian Yennefer is weird. Same goes for a black Fringilla. Indian and mediocre-looking Triss.\n+ No humming of the medallion.\n+ Killing Mousesack/Ermion, and replacing him with a psychotic doppler, is so stupid.\n+ The all-powerful sorceress Yennefer do shit little fighting with a sword in episode 6 and casting portals in episode 4.\n+ Yennefer as a character in the show makes no sense. \" You wanted to be beautiful and powerful so you gave up fertility, you killed Anica, you betrayed Aretruza because you weren’t happy with what you got and now she is acting all bitchy because she got fooled to go to Aretruza.\" https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/ed6wtj/episode_discussion_s01e07_before_a_fall/?sort=top\n+ No witcher detective mode forensics scenes.\n+ A severe lack of emphasis on monster killing, from setup to learning about the monster and setting to execution.\n+ What the fuck. Why did Geralt even fight the drowners/ghouls in the episode 8?\n+ Vilgefortz does a team kill at episode 8 for no reason, as if that's the only way for the writers to show that Vilgefortz is evil. And the fight scene where all he does is conjure swords is hilarious.\n+ Fringilla is commically super villain.\n\nI sort of wish this show went the route of medieval Supernatural/CSI/Mushishi. That would be less ambitiously dumb as a Game of Thrones ruler civil war grandiosity.\n\n\"Sapkowski was very often criticised for using modern language in his books, to which he replies: this is not medieval times, it's never-never-land and, besides, they do not speak Polish, he's just translating.\" Interesting. https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/ed6wmz/episode_discussion_s01e02_four_marks/fbga66a/",

    "review": "Surprisingly insightful with its messages, particularly aiming at the bullshit hypocrisy when everyone pitches the idea that they're making the world a better place. Also all the geek humor and props such as Sublime Text, a One Piece hat, PyChess, etc. It dabbles a little too often into crude humor, archetypes, and cookie cutter plots, but the other greatnesses in the story make it worth watching.\n\nNovel at first but starting to tire out as it continues on in almost Big Bang Theory format with the occasional nerd joke followed by its generic overarching storyline. It uses the technology as a setting and sticks with raunchy and droling sitcom jokes.\n\nI wish it stayed more Silicon Valley relevant and less on stereotypical geek humor.\n\nI Liked the last few seasons. I think it grew on me.",

Felt like a prequel/teaser more so than a season 1.\n\nTrevor as a carefree humored man is a great twist. Keeps the dialogue alive even given his trite position as a person hoping to follow footsteps of his family even with their excommunicated, damaged legacy.\n\nIn July 2021, I ended up rewatching the whole season and not recognizing that I had already watched the season! It did feel vaguely familiar.. It certainly is more enjoyable this time around as I played a Castlevania game and can appreciate it more.",

    "review": "I like the two-bit nature that the story forces the actors to play. I also like the meta-nature of certain conversations when detailing the actors when the newcomers do random stuff (especially when that one old man comes into the fray).\n\nThe premise is something very fun. I can really enjoy it like a American-directed version of an MMO, with quests, guests randomly pillaging and raping, various pyrotechnic effects and invincibility. The repeated events add a nice rhythm to it, like a deja vu movie, that you can really start to jive to and appreciate the details on each iteration.\n\nIn terms of themes, I thought it raised some interesting questions in AI that haven't been really mainstreamed before. For example, the literal creation of worlds (far beyond what other works of fiction have done with VR). The controllable layers of AI could be explored in more depth but I thought it raised interesting points, e.g., scripted dialogue to improvisation to self-interest, levels of emotional feeling for conveying lines, affectation. I also liked how the varieties of narratives: some are committee-chosen and market-tested (like the Hector event of blasting through the town); others get increasingly crazier as you delve outside the town like Pariah, the city of thieves and sex.\n\nBernard as a host was a little ridiculous. It was like the level of soap dramas in the reveal. I do like the overall idea, that there's a programmer who knows how to code hosts and is one himself. He's in a unique position that would be tantamount to humans knowing how to program the human genome. The other reveals are a little much too---like Dolores being Wyatt, William and Dolores actually occurring at a different time length; William as the old man; Ford as the villain followed by Ford as the hero in the end.",

    "review": "This is quite the show—haven't experienced quite this since Twin Peaks. It can be overly flashy at times, but boy is it ambitious. They really allow the creative reins free: the narrative, the visuals, the horror elements, some of the side character developments with powers such as Cary and Kerry.\n\nSome excellent scenes as showcases:\n\nThe deaf scene in episode 5: now _that_ is ambitious. And what an ending. Truly a combination of horror and supernatural.\n\nThe conversation hilarity between Cary and Oliver in episode 7. And then the dynamic between Cary and Sydney. Really makes up for the stalest episode of the season: the sixth.\n\nIt can get mainstream and boring unfortunately at times---episode 6 stalled the story. it also could have ended at episode 7.",

    "review": "David Letterman and Barack Obama have a great dynamic. I'm not even that interested in politics because of the smarminess of it all. But the way they bounce off each other is very natural, very ingenious. Barack's answers seemed prepared but not politically prepared. It was fascinating to hear how he thinks. And his frame of references: Senator Moynihan from 1920s in New York, an experiment of three Egyptians in Tahrir Square. I love how little of it focused on specific political decisions. But rather, the banter between the two and a collection of anecdotes that paint a picture of who Barack Obama is.",

Some of it can be rather superficial to keep with mainstream---sometimes wish it went deeper. I like episodes end with an actionable note, that current ways we affect nature matter and are affecting the ecosystems we analyze. Scenes range very much from majestic to adrenaline-filled to comedic. The cities episode was especially interesting: Bowerbirds decorate their houses with garbage, steal everything that isn't nailed down and masquerade as women. So they're no different to any other Aussie bloke; jaguar snatching a piglet in India; monkeys stealing food from a grocery market; two gangs of 60 spotted hyenas battling over territory; wells catfish eating pidgeons; the Chinese sequence of going through streets and zooming in/out; hatchling turtles not adapting; and the productive notes like trees in Milan or integrated ecosystem in Singapore.",

    "review": "The internal dialogues, the way it just saunters around in narrative as a true slice-of-life. I love it all. This is easily the most healing genre of live-action series I've seen.\n\nThere's a part that irks me sometimes about its unabashed happiness. For example, he has this nostalgic feeling about the sea in one episode and one shot shows a bunch of fish hauled off in a ship; this reminds me just how culturally these depend on. If those fish were human bodies, it would be horrifying. In another episode with pasta, he wishes he could go against the social formality of the restaurant and just slurp down pasta with his chopsticks, and drink beer instead of wine. While I admire that he should do what he wants, I think it conflates the formality angle of just enjoying food to the best with the customs set down to actually enjoy it. For example, I think if the goal were really to maximize food enjoyment, you might learn something by taking the Italian approach of wine, forks, and biting down instead of slurping. This isn't something I hold against the series—if anything, I respect them more for making this transparent as part of one's lifestyle.",

    "review": "Interesting split of characters in a Game of Thrones style: Eleven sometimes with Hopper; Nancy and Johnathon; Mike, Will, mother, and Bob; Dustin, Steve, Lucas, Max. Not as interesting as the first season with the more horror feeling, world-building, and inside-out world as well. This is sort of banal and falling onto the same flavors: Will is still a victim; Winona Ryder plays the concerned mother. Eleven is literally seen crying like every episode still playing the victim. Stranger Things 2 overall is just not as well-defined.\n\nThe drama between Nancy and X is trite. Kind of unfortunate Mike has less of a role this season. Everyone in general is less focused on and more spread-out. An eyes-rolling banality of a douche racist older brother. I also liked the few episodes where Dustin raises the demogorgon. Super power revenge is a little stupid. Jump scares and music not as interesting this season.\n\nI do like the new girl. The only interesting dynamic is Steve and Dustin, and Hopper and Eleven. And that new director has morals.\n\nCallback references like the Eggo waffles is totally not subtle. It's more eye-rolling. These are all one-bit, as if they define the character. Will's music mixtape. Steve's bat.",

    "review": "Interesting intersection of narratives with three main stories starting around the middle: the kids entering sci-fi and coming of age escaping the government; the teens with their love triangle and kill-the-moster; the adults with their save Will and conspiracy.\n\nThe vibe is fun and oldies references. The geeky humor and kids with sci-fi and a coming of age. I can see why people like the series, probably for this part. I especially love the intro and Twin Peaks like cut transitioning into the start of each episode.\n\nInvestigative drama is played out well in a sort of Twin peaks old town vibe way but aay less cozy and less surreal. What I love about the mystery of the alluding to all the various possibilities. It may not arrive at them and most likely the real solution is quite simple and not that interesting, but leaving up these questions all these possibilities is what makes it so inviting. Similar to the Prisoner and other otpf those like films with Jake Gylenhaal in that directors movies.\n\nThe high school group drama is a little boring. Very Sixteen Candles or like any other John Hughes film. Thw whole fight scene and then cups coming up for some tpstupid tpdrama. Totally infuriating. Kill the monster vibe attached to this doesn't really help cut it.\n\nAs for as characters, the Will family is really good. Kids too, although occasionally one sided with Dustin as the playful comic, and black kid as getting on everyones nerves, and Mike as the straight edge.\n\nSome of the dialogue and pacing can feel rushed and synthetic, to move plot points during the end.\n\nThe whole conspiracy government angle is a little wacky. Totally implausible. Especially with how organized they are, from state to fake pseudo educational counselors to technicians and bugging everything. And on the mystery side as if everyone can really understand whats going on. And as if it is just one person with full authority to personify the evil lab. Also just one girl and one monster.\n\nThe angle of the opposite world like the veil of shadows is neat.",

    "review": "Damn. That's pretty dark for a drama. Real sex. It doesn't cower from displaying him entering whorehouses. It seems like everyone is out to get him. Like an empty vial, his emotions are showed through others around him. Having this shown live action somehow feels a little more sillier than in animation or manga form.\n\nIt's deep in tropes as from the manga with a beta guy and a harem of girls ranging in ages and a boring angsty history of a father murdering a cheating mother and a miserable writing career. I like the faxing machine gimmick where a note appears every so often reminding you that he's a murderer's son and displays more explicitly his angst. But more so, it builds on these tropes with a far more mature presentation behind it. Everyone around him is a pretty interesting and dynamic character playing on their tropes. If only the protagonist did too.\n\nNanaka is best girl (in looks at least).\n\nEnd of episode 7: Oh DAMN!\n\nI really really like that the show actually ending with Shin with one of the girls, and not just the bland open-ended harem ending. And that it was never an obvious shipping, but through the character history it makes the most sense as Hitomi had the most reason to live with him as she read his books and is very knowledgeable about the same things he is.",

It really drives the story and prevents it from stagnating with cloying drama cliches. I like how they include others into the business rather than in Breaking Bad where Walter is to fend for himself. Some of it can be overly dramatic as Season 1 drags on unfortunately, with no stand out stars aside from Bateman. The undercover agent seducing a gay redneck is a weak subplot, and so is the inert action from the local heroin dealers. Bateman and Ruth are the most dynamic characters of the season. The Snells, the drug carterl, and the cops all need better character-building.",

In general the jokes were all great. He's a great storyteller more so than a traditional stand-up comedian. Random Youtube commenter says, 'His mannerisms are reminiscent of Robin Williams'. Polite and soft-spoken durations followed by sudden climactic explosive antics.' Yes!",

    "review": "Well scripted, nice exploration of closeted emotions particularly through its speaking with dead people.\n\nI really enjoy the opening. The year of life makes a strong statement about viewing the person's overall life.\n\nThe death teasing at the start of some episodes (and misc. scenes) is a little irritating. Also occasionally overdramatic and loves to draw more conflicts for the sake of the drama. Not sure how I feel about the same when they do something like a confession, and relapse to reveal that it was all in a person's head daydreaming.\n\nThe story's progression is great, although it's not as spontaneous as it should be: tends to stick to same relationships only because of employability conveniences. It also grows more violent and sexual merely to fit the demographic, often leading to loose and often awkward plot twists (such as the finale explaining how Lisa died).",

The aftermath of the sirens for example is one of the most hilarious moments in the film. \"We gotta find some.. wizard to change him back\"\n\nI love the use of music to keep the harmonious atmosphere.\n\nSuper cheesy ending, but the lighthearted comedic tone of the series is appropriate with it.",

It was lackluster for the first season and a half or so, where I actually started laughing (season 2 episode 7+). I got well into Season 3 and still couldn't find it very interesting.",

    "review": "This seems like a condescending TV series for pseudo-intellectuals. It carries heavy, one-sided messages driving hyperbole as the narrative device and with flawed reasoning without any subtlety. It's the live-action equivalent of GITS II, Psycho-Pass, and all the other pretentious animes out there.\n\nIt can sometimes be a thin bridge between what marks pretention and what marks profound. For example, is Angel's Egg or the original GITS pretentious or profound? But I think for the majority of examples, it can be very clearly argued through the presentation whether it's one or the other. Black Mirror is not at all like 1984 or Brave New World because first of all, the others can drive well just mechanically with their excellent prose; but most importantly, its messages are better reinforced with real conflicts.Black Mirror doesn't say anything other than point out possible flaws in society.\n\nEpisode 2: Must it always be so drab? I can see a lot of use in this technology and enjoyment. It's just this particular portraayal of the scenario. the interruptions with ads seems interesting. has a bias for social, in person interactions as if this is more \"real\" than some happening virtually. if anything it just represents a defficiency with the simulations not representing all senses but just vision and hearing in a broken mii figure, given that the rest with intermediate transitions is jus black halls. the only person who enjoys the scenario is an irish dimwit, foul-mouthed and made for people to hate him. i'm happy to buy things that aren't physical. in anything it's more important to be than physical\n\ni can admire director for having an unabashed message, but it's a little dumb and one sided. the choice of american idol as the canvass for sensation seems a little boring. the fact that MC becomes assimilated as a channel is perhaps a goodness of technology.. but i guess the message is that everything can be commodotized",

The choice of actors, their races, wow. This is the type of generic mass appeal that an American viewer wants. Narrative is the only mediocrity. Acting, visuals, shaky cam action. This is like the usual genericism that people enjoy as guilty pleasures, analogous to those that anime viewers love. It's like a fetish for people to consume---this one only slightly more mainstream than lolis for anime weaboos and even rape for sexual deviants. Who's to say one is any morally better than the other? Nobody is accurately depicted. They go for boyish nerd humor, equivalent to Big Bang Theory, nothing even like the social anxiety and awkardness true 'nerds' and geniuses feel from thinkning deeply and stuck in isolation. Dialogue is so forced it's hard to even treat this as realistic. Love how the villain in the pilot episode is European.",

Also all the geek humor and props such as Sublime Text, a One Piece hat, PyChess, etc. It dabbles a little too often into crude humor, archetypes, and cookie cutter plots, but the other greatnesses in the story make it worth watching.\n\nNovel at first but starting to tire out as it continues on in almost Big Bang Theory format with the occasional nerd joke followed by its generic overarching storyline. It uses the technology as a setting and sticks with raunchy and droling sitcom jokes.\n\nI wish it stayed more Silicon Valley relevant and less on stereotypical geek humor.",

    "review": "S2E5 is easily my favorite. The way the spin the intro to put you on the Crown's side followed by Lord Altrincham's side. \"One of The Crown’s strengths is the way it seamlessly shifts between stories of major international prominence and political intrigue — the palace visit of the Kennedys or the Suez Crisis, for instance — and humanistic ones that people don’t seem to know much about. In the first season, the best example of this revolved around the power dynamic shared between Winston Churchill and his portrait artist, Graham Sutherland. This time around, it’s the tale of an amiable chap named Lord Altrincham.\" ([link](https://www.vulture.com/2017/12/the-crown-lord-altrincham-john-grigg.html)).\n\nS2E9. What another excellent episode. This time focusing on the internal strifes with father-son relationships, particularly Philip's. it's easy to see both perspectives regarding the specific upbringing of Charles. On one side, he's clearly a sensitive child and one different from Philip. So applying the same childhood strategy that made Philip grow from conflict would not necessarily apply to Charles. On the other hand, he's clearly doted on by butlers, servants, and the like. And he is absolutely a spoiled wuss.",

    "review": "Core story, characters, and cinematography are excellent. Offred's narrative during scenes adds its own style. The whole idea of pushing further on women as objects is excellent, with the whole weirdness behind the concept of a handmaiden. I alos like its depiction of the transition away from modern society, and that its influence is isolated to just the US, where even tourists can come and gawk.\n\nThe female bias is strong here, whether you call it feminism or any other word. The totaliarianism is surprisingly only against women and gays (both rights that women lost). Other minority groups are fine: black, native American, Indian, different Asian populations, alternative religions. The protagonist is an upper middle class white women---free-spirited, well-educated, carries a biting wit, and unattractive. She first dated her husband as he was already married when with her. Her best friend is a lesbian. The cast is almost harem-like with a dominant patriach in the family and a lowly driver. The setting reeks of a wet fantasy to espoute liberal feminism: hardcore Christianity preached as a propaganda weapon for oppression, patriarchy, gun rights, sex exploitation and loss of pregnancy rights, an underground of liberal rebels, female conservatives regretting their path. This is more like a bastardization of the US than more representative of cultures that already do suffer from these values but with more nuance (i.e., Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran). I think it's good that the TV series went for inclusion in the casting for persons of color even though it's inauthentic to the original story: still no Asians though. Maybe this is okay though: a story can only address so many issues at a time, and so this one happens to address gender inequality. We leave the topic of other marginalized groups to another day.. I guess I just despise that feminism is so disapproportionately so large of a movement for how much of a non-issue its issues are compared to other minority groups.",

She was pudgy over the place and more grounded as a middle-aged women.\n\nEpisode 3 is just a tad too extreme in going ovrboad. He’s getting caricatured.\n\nEpisode 4 was excellent. Curb Your Enthusiasm always excels in its several threads converging to make hilarious jokes, and with just a tint of absurdism.",

I also like the gimmicks, like introducing a word followed by 'This means X'. I love the meta comments, like 'In all honesty, I prefer long-form television to the movies. It's so much more convenient to consume entertainment from the comfort of your own home'. 'Godforsaken Nickelodeon'. He's petty, narcissistic, weirdly dumb, conniving.\n\nI also love the pedagogical angle to the book. From vocabulary to grammar. And the way it makes its way into character eccentricities.\n\nUnlike other novel adaptations, this TV series really takes to owning its medium.",

Ed and Peggy are probably the best characters, alongside the sherriff, his wife, and the father-in-law.\n\nThe gang members are very Coen Brothers-like, from family brothers, to the Native American Hanzee to the Twin Brothers to Mike Milligan; and the season 1 references. Nick Offerman completely stole the show episode 6 with his amazing drunk, witty and nonsensical performance.\n\nI love the era of UFOs, woman awkwardly trying to find their own place, the Vietnam war traumas.",

Amazing in its simplicity that's similar to Samurai Gourmet but so different in its strengths (Samurai Gourmet benefits from an ASMR-like feel of just eating food and loveable duo of characters; Midnight Diner focuses more on coming-and-going characters and their relationships established since the diner). The execution in the first episode especially is just brilliant—music really hits it.",

The concept and direction, man.\n\nSeason 12 and I'm still amazed how the show still keep its humor fresh and always varied in trying new things. It really latches onto what makes the characters unique. Continuity is incredible. Acting is phenomenal. Charlie and Dennis are still my favorite characters. Sometimes the episodes just don't work out (e.g., S12E01's musical), but you definitely have to commend them for trying.\n\nFor reference, here's a great list of episodes: https://www.reddit.com/r/IASIP/comments/4cis95/the_bracket_is_complete_and_the_results_for_the/\n\n\"I love how the ass pounder keeps punching as he wheels it out\nandymaq\nIt's that kind of attention to detail that makes Sunny brilliant. Like Charlie pouring the water bottle on the Thunder Gun Express slide. \"that should be good, right?\"\" YES.\n\nSeason 13: Not that great. Not a good amount of interesting content.",

    "review": "While somewhat white-washed in its culture because it's on a popular network like ABC, it still preserves some aspects of asian-specific humor. For example, I like episode 2's skit where the Mom and kids catch onto the Dad not having the Mom around because he accidentally expresses emotions through words. In Eddie Huang's words, Asians express love through criticism and micromanagement. :) I don't identify too much with the dad, although I can see why the more effeminate dad in the family rings true in most Asian American households. The writing is hilarious at times as it's unabashed in references and sticky situations such as racism boundaries when Eddie is the only asian in the school and he's always paired up the new Asian transfer student.\n\nThe mom-dad dynamic reminds me of Malcolm in the Middle but slightly less outrageous in the mom's behavior. There's even a Dewey-type character.\n\nConstance Wu is easily the star of the show.\n\nI love all the 90's throwbacks: blooming onions, Golden Corral, Black Angus, Sizzler's, ShaqFu, dial-up, no internet and thus focus on local friends/community, Scar's Face, Miller's Crossing, all the hip hop artists.\n\nKind of unfortunate it never gets into real problems (it is a sitcom comedy) or develop any interesting relationship among the brothers. The two younger ones are more minor characters with the same role.\n\nSecond season is very different from the first. While I like that it focuses on more characters than just Eddie (who I didn't think was really the strongest), it put less focus on Cattleman's Ranch and the Asian aspect of the show. It feels more like a typical American show's antics but with Asian-American actors. They're all typecasted---even the mother plays a snarky one-liner jokester that comes in once in a while. Sometimes the jokes are inconsistent too---at one time the joke is that the kids complain about having extended bed time; in another (s02e21), the kids are rewarded in finding the watch by getting extended bed time. In a scene in season 1, mother and father make a ton of film references and are mocked for being cinephiles; in s02e22, the dad pretends to be a cinephile when renting out movies.",

    "review": "Conversations are often too manipulative and forced in plots as if everyone were super witty in their comebacks.\n\nStrangely racist in how it depicts the different cultures, and also tends to self-insert model culture at times into it; for example, portraying those who think poorly of gay rights as evil.\n\nExtremely mainstream and diluted content. We're led to believe for example that when Daenrys is outside the city wall, she can shout and everyone can hear her. Gilly never talks about her sisters, and is purely there for the love tryst with Sam. Very sloppy action scenes. With its many subplots in general, it's not surprising that a lot of them can end up rather weak. For exampe, Season 7 goes at an amusingly accelerated pace given the remaining time they have left. And at the same time it packs a lot of interesting content paying off for so much build-up previously. All it has going for it is the main thread of Jon and Daenarys. The Arya-Sansa drama is forced. The fast travel from Dragonstone to the north, then the raven back to Dragonstone, then Dany riding her dragons to save Jon in the north. So implausible. Jon, Dany, and to some extent the Lannisters play well this season. Arya's is so dull given that she's just lying around in Winterfell—she was best played as an unknown underdog. The Hand, Littlefinger, and other deception is all lacking. The plot hole with Bran being the three-eyed raven and yet no one in Winterfell talking to him; and in general Bran's arc is so dull. The reuniting of the Stark children is disappointing.\n\nGame of Thrones helped popularize sexposition. Interestingly, I found it ironic that the sexual appeal dwindled as seasons accumulated rather than the other way around. I guess they're targeted more towards the devoted viewers now, who are more interested in plot fanservice such as Jon and Dany than immediate sexual gratification.\n\nSeason 8 is like fanfiction. It's bad in story, with characters playing a one-minute spiel of their real depth. It services fanservice for every character dynamic interaction: for example, Jon and Daenrys; Jon and Sam; Jaime and Brienne; Jaime and Tyrion; Tyrion and Sansa; Hound and Arya; Arya and the Hound; the Hound and the Mountain. The Night King battle is just boring, with little battle dynamics specific to fighting undead; or, say, using the dragons to demolish the armies instead of staying high above (there is no anti-air). It's also hilarious that although they spend 7 seasons talking about the winter coming, the Night King invades and loses in a single 1 hour episode. On one side, I agree that in only six episodes for the last season, one episode for the Night King is enough as Game of Thrones excels most in the political intrigue and civil war, not the otherworldly effects which serve more as a fantasy complement. On the other hand, it surprises me that they spent all of the first and second episode on random gibbery talking in preparation for the single-episode battle.\n\nI agree the series unravelled and became worse as the the number of plot threads increased over the seasons (https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8zitvc/spoilers_why_has_game_of_thrones_gotten_worse/).",

    "review": "Voice acting is amazing with their improv. It really helps establish the duo.\n\nI love how innovative some of the episodes are. Much like mainstream shows Futurama and Simpsons and maybe even classics like Invader Zim and Animaniacs but far more ambitious each episode and willingness to be far cruder; perhaps closer to other modern shows like Adventure Time; Gravity Falls; Venture Brothers. The ways they introduce science fiction into humor, like Rick or Morty fucking up something in the world, so then they enter a new reality and kill/replace the Rick and Morty there. At the potentials hinted at in possibilities they simply never showed on screen to give the story even more depth such as Morty's mind blowers. Sometimes it's even in the writing such as S03E08 doing a compilation of shorts while tied into a holistic episode. Or the therapist episode where Rick must find out how to come back after being turned into a cucumber.",
