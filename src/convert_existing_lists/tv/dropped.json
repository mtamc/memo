  {"title":"Seinfeld","score":"5","date_started":"03/26/20","date_finished":"S03E10/-","year":"1989","staff":"NBC","comments":"The laugh track is annoying. I watched the pilot in November 2006 and couldn't get any further. I tried again now in 2020 and endured it, assuming the pilot (and season 1 more broadly) isn't necessarily where Seinfeld gets great (https://www.reddit.com/r/seinfeld/comments/aiyqll/recently_got_into_seinfeld_the_jump_in_quality/). It was lackluster for the first season and a half or so, where I actually started laughing (season 2 episode 7+). I got well into Season 3 and still couldn't find it very interesting."},

It seemed like it would be his eccentric jackass role, but now in a high school setting. I was also curious how the humor would play out now that it's in a more child-friendly, corporate network vibe. Well, it's pretty much how I expect. Ended up coasting through various videos while high."},
  {"title":"Black Mirror","score":"4","date_started":"11/10/17","date_finished":"2/-","year":"","staff":"","comments":"This seems like a condescending TV series for pseudo-intellectuals. It carries heavy, one-sided messages driving hyperbole as the narrative device and with flawed reasoning without any subtlety. It's the live-action equivalent of GITS II, Psycho-Pass, and all the other pretentious animes out there.\n\nIt can sometimes be a thin bridge between what marks pretention and what marks profound. For example, is Angel's Egg or the original GITS pretentious or profound? But I think for the majority of examples, it can be very clearly argued through the presentation whether it's one or the other. Black Mirror is not at all like 1984 or Brave New World because first of all, the others can drive well just mechanically with their excellent prose; but most importantly, its messages are better reinforced with real conflicts.Black Mirror doesn't say anything other than point out possible flaws in society.\n\nEpisode 2: Must it always be so drab? I can see a lot of use in this technology and enjoyment. It's just this particular portraayal of the scenario. the interruptions with ads seems interesting. has a bias for social, in person interactions as if this is more \"real\" than some happening virtually. if anything it just represents a defficiency with the simulations not representing all senses but just vision and hearing in a broken mii figure, given that the rest with intermediate transitions is jus black halls. the only person who enjoys the scenario is an irish dimwit, foul-mouthed and made for people to hate him. i'm happy to buy things that aren't physical. in anything it's more important to be than physical\n\ni can admire director for having an unabashed message, but it's a little dumb and one sided. the choice of american idol as the canvass for sensation seems a little boring. the fact that MC becomes assimilated as a channel is perhaps a goodness of technology.. but i guess the message is that everything can be commodotized"},

  {"title":"The Flash","score":"4","date_started":"03/31/17","date_finished":"","year":"2014","staff":"","comments":"Wow, the number of cliches is amazing. Every beat in the intro is predictable and feels a literal formula; every scene, smile, body gesture is calculated. The choice of actors, their races, wow. This is the type of generic mass appeal that an American viewer wants. Narrative is the only mediocrity. Acting, visuals, shaky cam action. This is like the usual genericism that people enjoy as guilty pleasures, analogous to those that anime viewers love. It's like a fetish for people to consume---this one only slightly more mainstream than lolis for anime weaboos and even rape for sexual deviants. Who's to say one is any morally better than the other? Nobody is accurately depicted. They go for boyish nerd humor, equivalent to Big Bang Theory, nothing even like the social anxiety and awkardness true 'nerds' and geniuses feel from thinkning deeply and stuck in isolation. Dialogue is so forced it's hard to even treat this as realistic. Love how the villain in the pilot episode is European."},

  {"title":"Reaper","score":"4","date_started":"09/25/07","date_finished":"-/-","year":"2007","staff":"The CW","comments":"Surprisingly insightful with its messages, particularly aiming at the bullshit hypocrisy when everyone pitches the idea that they're making the world a better place. Also all the geek humor and props such as Sublime Text, a One Piece hat, PyChess, etc. It dabbles a little too often into crude humor, archetypes, and cookie cutter plots, but the other greatnesses in the story make it worth watching.\n\nNovel at first but starting to tire out as it continues on in almost Big Bang Theory format with the occasional nerd joke followed by its generic overarching storyline. It uses the technology as a setting and sticks with raunchy and droling sitcom jokes.\n\nI wish it stayed more Silicon Valley relevant and less on stereotypical geek humor."},
