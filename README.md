# Memo

## Workflow

**1. Locally.** Running the website locally is recommended to test changes before pushing commits.

```bash
# install the dependencies
npm install

# you will need to run these once
npx netlify login # requires being logged into netlify, ask for credentials
npx netlify link # when it asks what linking method to use, choose github

# The app will then be available locally for building with
 npx netlify dev

# Deprecated alternative
npm run dev
```

If you use `npx netlify dev` your serverless functions will also be available at:

```
GET http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/<function_file_name_without_extension>
```

**2. Staging branch.** Generally you should push commits directly to staging. Pull requests aren't really necessary
due to the small team size, but if you'd like code review send a PR to merge to staging.

**3. Production branch.** Merge staging to production whenever you think the changes are ready. Deploys to
the website from production are automatic.

## Web Development Stack

We use:

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for web hosting and deployment
- [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org) for runtime environment and package management
- [Eleventy](https://11ty.io) for static site generation
- A tiny inline JS pipeline with a [component-based architecture](https://medium.com/@dan.shapiro1210/understanding-component-based-architecture-3ff48ec0c238)
- Serverless (FaaS) development pipeline with [Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev) and [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions)

**Credentials.**
This project is deployed via netlify with the account `{ask}` (ask me for password).

External API keys are set in [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/td-memo/settings/deploys#environment)
environment variables. They are also avaiable in production inside
`process.env`.

You might need to run `npx netlify login` inside the project.

**Netlify plugins.**

- Identity. Managed at https://app.netlify.com/sites/td-memo/identity
- FaunaDB. Managed at https://dashboard.fauna.com by logging in with netlify account integration.

**DB**

We currently use mongoDB, logged into via the MONGODB_URL

**Error handling.**
Error handling is done using `neverthrow`, which is similar to
Rust Result or FP Either. Learn more about its API at:
https://github.com/supermacro/neverthrow

**Current rate limits.**

- TV/Series

  - TMDB API: unlimited

- Google Books API

  - Potentially 1000/day with key, with easy free application for 100k (warning: old information)
    - Right now we're not using an API key. If you want to try, [then sign up for one](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys?visit_id=637791358916015831-391700742&rd=1) and add GOOGLE_API_KEY to the Netlify environment variables. The code will automatically pick it up.

- Games
  - IGDB: 4 reqs/sec (currently fetching details takes 2 requests due to getting company names)
  - HLTB scraping: unknown but at least near-unlimited
